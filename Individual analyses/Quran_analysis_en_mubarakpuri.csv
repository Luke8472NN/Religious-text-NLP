Al-Anam,18,-0.5267,0.167,0.833,0.0,and thus do we explain the ayat in detail that the way of the criminal may become manifest
Al-Anam,34,0.684,0.068,0.703,0.229,say have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke worship besides allah say will not follow your vain desire if did would go astray and would not be one of the rightly guided

Al-Anam,24,0.4404,0.0,0.888,0.112,then they are returned to allah their master the just lord surely his is the judgment and he is the swiftest in taking account
Al-Anam,38,0.8402,0.071,0.669,0.259,say who rescue you from the dark recess of the land and the sea when you call upon him begging and in secret saying if he allah only save u from these danger we shall truly be grateful

Al-Anam,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for every news there is reality and you will come to know
Al-Anam,55,-0.296,0.078,0.881,0.041,and when you see those who engage in false conversation about our verse of the qur an by mocking at them stay away from them till they turn to another topic and if shaytan cause you to forget then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the wrongdoer
Al-Anam,23,-0.1531,0.068,0.932,0.0,there is no responsibility for them upon those who have taqwa but their duty is to remind them that they may attain taqwa
Al-Anam,96,-0.929,0.19,0.751,0.059,and leave alone those who take their religion a play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world but remind them with it the qur an lest soul tubsal for that which one ha earned when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides allah and even if he offer every ransom it will not be accepted from him such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned for them will be drink of boiling water and painful torment because they used to disbelieve
Al-Anam,78,-0.7632,0.134,0.808,0.057,say shall we invoke others besides allah false deity that can do u neither good nor harm and shall we turn on our heel after allah ha guided u like one whom the shayatin devil have made to go astray confused wandering through the land his companion calling him to guidance saying come to u say verily allah guidance is the only guidance and we have been commanded to submit ourselves to the lord of all that exists

Al-Anam,24,-0.1531,0.105,0.814,0.081,and remember when ibrahim said to his father azar do you take idol a god verily see you and your people in manifest error
Al-Anam,24,0.7964,0.0,0.722,0.278,thus did we show ibrahim the kingdom of the heaven and the earth that he be one of those who have faith with certainty
Al-Anam,25,0.5023,0.0,0.881,0.119,when the night overcame him he saw kawkab he said this is my lord but when it afala he said like not those that set
Al-Anam,31,0.5927,0.0,0.886,0.114,when he saw the moon rising up he said this is my lord but when it set he said unless my lord guide me shall surely be among the misguided people
Al-Anam,38,0.8957,0.0,0.737,0.263,when he saw the sun rising up he said this is my lord this is greater but when it afalat he said my people am indeed free from all that you join a partner in worship with allah
Al-Anam,22,0.7717,0.0,0.712,0.288,verily have turned my face towards him who ha created the heaven and the earth hanifan and am not of the idolators
Al-Anam,54,-0.5719,0.134,0.792,0.074,his people disputed with him he said do you dispute with me about allah while he ha guided me and fear not those whom you associate with allah in worship nothing can happen to me except when my lord will something my lord comprehends in his knowledge all thing will you not then remember
Al-Anam,53,0.4497,0.071,0.758,0.171,and how should fear those whom you associate in worship with allah while you fear not that you have joined in worship with allah thing for which he ha not sent down to you any sultan so which of the two party ha more right to be in security if you but know
Al-Anam,24,-0.3818,0.176,0.739,0.085,it is those who believe and confuse not their belief with zulm wrong for them only there is security and they are the guided
Al-Anam,27,0.6705,0.0,0.82,0.18,and that wa our proof which we gave ibrahim against his people we in degree raise whom we will certainly your lord is all wise all knowing
Al-Anam,38,0.765,0.0,0.845,0.155,and we bestowed upon him ishaq and ya qub each of them we guided and before him we guided nuh and among his progeny dawud sulayman ayyub yusuf musa and harun thus do we reward the good doer
Al-Anam,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and zakariyya and yahya and isa and iliyas each one of them wa of the righteous
Al-Anam,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and isma il and al yasa and yunus and lut and each one of them we preferred above the alamin mankind and jinns of their time
Al-Anam,22,0.2263,0.0,0.917,0.083,and also some of their father and their progeny and their brother we chose them and we guided them to straight path
Al-Anam,40,0.6124,0.06,0.794,0.146,this is the guidance of allah with which he guide whomsoever he will of his servant but if they had joined in worship others with allah all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them
Al-Anam,30,-0.1531,0.085,0.848,0.067,they are those whom we gave the book al hukm and prophethood but if they disbelieve therein then indeed we have entrusted it to people who are not disbeliever therein
Al-Anam,32,0.3612,0.061,0.836,0.103,they are those whom allah had guided so follow their guidance say no reward ask of you for this the qur an it is only reminder for the alamin mankind and jinns
Al-Anam,82,0.4215,0.046,0.888,0.066,they did not estimate allah with an estimation due to him when they said nothing did allah send down to any human being by inspiration say who then sent down the book which musa brought light and guidance to mankind which you the jew have made into separate papersheets disclosing some of it and concealing much and you were taught that which neither you nor your father knew say allah sent it down then leave them to play in their vain discussion
Al-Anam,46,0.5423,0.028,0.892,0.079,and this is blessed book which we have sent down confirming what came before it so that you may warn the mother of town and all those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are constant in guarding their salah
Al-Anam,97,-0.9338,0.203,0.692,0.105,and who can be more unjust than he who invents lie against allah or say have received inspiration whereas he is not inspired in anything and who say will reveal the like of what allah ha revealed and if you could but see when the wrongdoer are in the agony of death while the angel are stretching forth their hand saying deliver your soul this day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against allah other than the truth and you used to reject his ayat with disrespect
Al-Anam,61,0.4939,0.063,0.826,0.112,and truly you have come unto u alone a we created you the first time you have left behind you all that which we had bestowed on you we see not with you your intercessor whom you claimed to be your partner now you and they have been cut off and all that you used to claim ha vanished from you
Al-Anam,49,-0.8074,0.151,0.808,0.04,verily it is allah who cause the seed grain and the fruit stone to split and sprout he brings forth the living from the dead and it is he who brings forth the dead from the living such is allah then how are you deluded away from the truth
Al-Anam,32,0.34,0.0,0.928,0.072,he is the cleaver of the daybreak he ha appointed the night for resting and the sun and the moon for reckoning such is the measuring of the almighty the all knowing
Al-Anam,41,0.4767,0.044,0.843,0.113,it is he who ha set the star for you so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea we have indeed explained in detail our ayat for people who know
Al-Anam,33,0.7003,0.0,0.815,0.185,it is he who ha created you from single person and ha given you place of residing and place of storage indeed we have explained in detail our revelation for people who understand
Al-Anam,91,0.3182,0.022,0.942,0.036,it is he who sends down water from the sky and with it we bring forth vegetation of all kind and out of it we bring forth green stalk from which we bring forth thick clustered grain and out of the date palm and it sprout come forth cluster of date hanging low and near and garden of grape olive and pomegranate each similar yet different look at their fruit when they begin to bear and yan ih verily in these thing there are sign for people who believe allah said
Al-Anam,39,0.8779,0.0,0.732,0.268,yet they join the jinns a partner in worship with allah though he ha created them and they attribute falsely without knowledge son and daughter to him be he glorified and exalted above what that they attribute to him
Al-Anam,33,0.6705,0.057,0.746,0.198,he is the badi originator of the heaven and the earth how can he have child when he ha no wife he created all thing and he is the all knower of everything
Al-Anam,31,0.409,0.117,0.719,0.164,such is allah your lord none ha the right to be worshipped but he the creator of all thing so worship him alone and he is the guardian over all thing
Al-Anam,22,0.667,0.06,0.675,0.265,no vision can grasp him but his grasp is over all vision he is the most subtle well acquainted with all thing
Al-Anam,37,0.1189,0.066,0.857,0.077,verily basa ir proof have come to you from your lord so whosoever see will do so for the good of himself and whosoever blind himself will do so against himself and am not hafiz over you
Al-Anam,31,0.4019,0.0,0.887,0.113,thus we explain variously the verse so that they the disbeliever may say you have darasta studied and that we may make the matter clear for the people who have knowledge
Al-Anam,26,0.705,0.0,0.737,0.263,follow what ha been inspired revealed to you from your lord none ha the right to be worshipped but he and turn aside from the idolators
Al-Anam,33,0.296,0.0,0.936,0.064,had allah willed they would not have taken others besides him in worship and we have not made you hafiz over them nor are you set over them to dispose of their affair
Al-Anam,47,-0.4767,0.122,0.795,0.083,and insult not those whom they worship besides allah lest they insult allah wrongfully without knowledge thus we have made fair seeming to each people it own doings then to their lord is their return and he shall inform them of all that they used to do
Al-Anam,41,0.4215,0.026,0.884,0.091,and they swear their strongest oath by allah that if there came to them sign they would surely believe therein say sign are but with allah and what will make you perceive that even if it came they will not believe
Al-Anam,31,-0.34,0.108,0.892,0.0,and we shall turn their heart and their eye away a they refused to believe therein for the first time and we shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly
Al-Anam,40,-0.7227,0.137,0.863,0.0,and even if we had sent down unto them angel and the dead had spoken unto them and we had gathered together all thing before them they would not have believed unless allah willed but most of them behave ignorantly
Al-Anam,41,-0.4176,0.157,0.745,0.098,and so we have appointed for every prophet enemy shayatin among mankind and jinni inspiring one another with adorned speech a delusion if your lord had so willed they would not have done it so leave them alone with their fabrication
Al-Anam,38,0.34,0.069,0.783,0.147,and tasgha to it that the heart of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to such deceit and that they may remain pleased with it and that they may commit what they are committing
Al-Anam,47,0.296,0.049,0.859,0.092,say shall seek judge other than allah while it is he who ha sent down unto you the book explained in detail those unto whom we gave the scripture know that it is revealed from your lord in truth so be not you of those who doubt
Al-Anam,28,0.872,0.0,0.688,0.312,and the word of your lord ha been fulfilled in truth and in justice none can change his word and he is the all hearer the all knower
Al-Anam,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you obey most of those on the earth they will mislead you far away from allah path they follow nothing but conjecture and they do nothing but lie
Al-Anam,21,0.8555,0.0,0.693,0.307,verily your lord it is he who know best who stray from his way and he know best the rightly guided
Al-Anam,18,0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,so eat of that on which allah name ha been mentioned if you are believer in his ayat
Al-Anam,54,0.8979,0.075,0.675,0.25,and why should you not eat of that on which allah name ha been mentioned while he ha explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you except under compulsion of necessity and surely many do lead astray by their own desire through lack of knowledge certainly your lord know best the transgressor
Al-Anam,24,-0.6124,0.264,0.597,0.138,leave sin open and secret verily those who commit sin will get due recompense for that which they used to commit mujahid said that
Al-Anam,40,0.8979,0.053,0.663,0.285,eat not of that on which allah name ha not been pronounced for surely it is disobedience and certainly the shayatin do inspire their friend to dispute with you and if you obey them then you would indeed be polytheist
Al-Anam,50,-0.3612,0.11,0.806,0.084,is he who wa dead and we gave him life and set for him light whereby he can walk among men like him who is in the darkness from which he can never come out thus it is made fair seeming to the disbeliever that which they used to do
Al-Anam,30,0.09,0.067,0.855,0.078,and thus we have set up in every town great one of it wicked people to plot therein but they plot not except against themselves and they perceive it not
Al-Anam,54,-0.7351,0.191,0.71,0.099,and when there come to them sign they say we shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the messenger of allah received allah know best with whom to entrust his message humiliation and disgrace from allah and severe torment will overtake the criminal for that which they used to plot
Al-Anam,45,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and whomsoever allah will to guide he open his breast to islam and whomsoever he will to send astray he make his breast closed and constricted a if he is climbing up to the sky thus allah put the wrath on those who believe not
Al-Anam,20,0.2263,0.0,0.909,0.091,and this is the path of your lord leading straight we have detailed our ayat for people who take heed
Al-Anam,24,0.5423,0.0,0.868,0.132,for them will be the abode of peace with their lord and he will be their wali because of what they used to do
Al-Anam,79,0.8294,0.036,0.805,0.159,and on the day when he will gather them together and say you assembly of jinni many did you mislead of men and their friend among the people will say our lord we benefited one from the other but now we have reached our appointed term which you did appoint for u he will say the fire be your dwelling place you will dwell therein forever except a allah may will certainly your lord is all wise all knowing
Al-Anam,19,0.2732,0.0,0.896,0.104,and thus we do make the wrongdoer supporter of one another because of that which they used to earn
Al-Anam,61,-0.6486,0.082,0.918,0.0,you assembly of jinni and human did not there come to you messenger from amongst you reciting unto you my verse and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say we bear witness against ourselves it wa the life of this world that deceived them and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbeliever
Al-Anam,20,0.2617,0.079,0.795,0.126,this is because your lord would not destroy the population of town for their wrongdoing while their people were unaware
Al-Anam,21,0.1511,0.0,0.926,0.074,for all there will be degree according to what they did and your lord is not unaware of what they do
Al-Anam,37,-0.0258,0.088,0.802,0.11,and your lord is al ghani full of mercy if he will he can destroy you and in your place make whom he will a your successor a he raised you from the seed of other people
Al-Anam,15,0.597,0.08,0.634,0.285,surely that which you are promised will verily come to pas and you cannot escape
Al-Anam,37,0.7121,0.07,0.726,0.204,say my people work according to your way surely too am working and you will come to know for which of u will be the happy end in the hereafter certainly the wrongdoer will not be successful
Al-Anam,55,0.1531,0.093,0.714,0.193,and they assign to allah share of the tilth and cattle which he ha created and they say this is for allah according to their claim and this is for our partner but the share of their partner reach not allah while the share of allah reach their partner evil is the way they judge
Al-Anam,51,-0.9048,0.235,0.728,0.037,and so to many of the idolators their partner have made fair seeming the killing of their child in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion and if allah had willed they would not have done so so leave them alone with their fabrication
Al-Anam,67,-0.5892,0.113,0.825,0.062,and according to their claim they say that such and such cattle and crop are hijr forbidden and none should eat of them except those whom we allow and they say there are cattle forbidden to be used for burden and cattle on which at slaughtering the name of allah is not pronounced lying against him allah he will recompense them for what they used to fabricate
Al-Anam,54,-0.7906,0.202,0.697,0.101,and they say what is in the belly of such and such cattle is for our male alone and forbidden to our female but if it is born dead then all have share therein he will punish them for their attribution of such false order to allah verily he is all wise all knower
Al-Anam,36,-0.875,0.271,0.677,0.052,indeed lost are they who have killed their child foolishly without knowledge and they have forbidden that which allah ha provided for them inventing lie against allah they have indeed gone astray and were not guided
Al-Anam,59,-0.2617,0.082,0.868,0.05,and it is he who produce garden ma rushat and not ma rushat and date palm and crop of different shape and taste and olive and pomegranate similar and different eat of their fruit when they ripen but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest and waste not by extravagance verily he like not the wasteful
Al-Anam,36,-0.2732,0.146,0.732,0.121,and of the cattle are some for burden and some smaller for farsh eat of what allah ha provided for you and follow not the footstep of shaytan surely he is to you an open enemy
Al-Anam,47,0.3818,0.054,0.843,0.103,eight pair of the sheep two male and female and of the goat two male and female say ha he forbidden the two male or the two female or the young which the womb of the two female enclose inform me with knowledge if you are truthful
Al-Anam,68,-0.7031,0.11,0.858,0.032,and of the camel two and of ox two say ha he forbidden the two male or the two female or the young which the womb of the two female enclose or were you present when allah ordered you such thing then who doe more wrong than one who invents lie against allah to lead mankind astray without knowledge certainly allah guide not the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Anam,77,0.2144,0.116,0.747,0.137,say find not in that which ha been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wish to eat it unless it be maytah dead animal or blood poured forth or the flesh of swine for that surely is unclean rijs or immorally slaughtered in the name of other than allah but whosoever is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing due limit for him certainly your lord is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Anam,52,0.3612,0.028,0.917,0.055,and unto those who are jew we forbade every animal with undivided hoof and we forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their back or their hawaya or is mixed up with bone thus we recompensed them for their rebellion and verily we are truthful
Al-Anam,27,-0.5106,0.18,0.743,0.077,if they deny you say your lord is the owner of vast mercy and never will his wrath be turned back from the people who are criminal
Al-Anam,64,0.2996,0.0,0.95,0.05,those who committed shirk say if allah had willed we would not have commited shirk nor would our father and we would not have forbidden anything against his will likewise belied those who were before them till they tasted our wrath say have you any knowledge proof that you can produce before u verily you follow the zann and you do nothing but lie
Al-Anam,20,0.296,0.103,0.744,0.153,say with allah is the perfect proof and argument had he so willed he would indeed have guided you all
Al-Anam,52,0.5621,0.05,0.818,0.132,say bring forward your witness who can testify that allah ha forbidden this then if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the vain desire of those who belie our ayat and such a believe not in the hereafter and they hold others a equal with their lord
Al-Anam,74,-0.9019,0.24,0.611,0.149,say come will recite what your lord ha prohibited you from join not anything in worship with him be kind and dutiful to your parent kill not your child because of poverty we provide sustenance for you and for them come not near to al fawahish immoral sin whether committed openly or secretly and kill not anyone whom allah ha forbidden except for just cause this he ha commanded you that you may understand
Al-Anam,69,0.8779,0.025,0.808,0.167,and come not near to the orphan property except to improve it until he or she attains the age of full strength and give full measure and full weight with justice we burden not any person but that which he can bear and whenever you speak say the truth even if near relative is concerned and fulfill the covenant of allah this he command you that you may remember

Al-Araf,22,0.296,0.116,0.688,0.196,and great number of town we destroyed our torment came upon them by night or while they were taking their midday nap
Al-Araf,17,-0.3919,0.196,0.804,0.0,no cry did they utter when our torment came upon them but this verily we were wrongdoer
Al-Araf,19,0.4404,0.0,0.861,0.139,then surely we shall question those people to whom it wa sent and verily we shall question the messenger
Al-Araf,19,0.4404,0.0,0.861,0.139,then surely we shall narrate unto them their whole story with knowledge and indeed we have not been absent
Al-Araf,31,0.9287,0.0,0.655,0.345,and the weighing on that day will be the true weighing so a for those whose scale of good deed will be heavy they will be the successful by entering paradise
Al-Araf,23,-0.4019,0.114,0.886,0.0,and a for those whose scale will be light they are those who will lose themselves for their wrongful behavior with our ayat
Al-Araf,20,0.7655,0.0,0.65,0.35,and surely we gave you authority on the earth and appointed for you therein livelihood little thanks do you give
Al-Araf,33,0.4019,0.059,0.809,0.132,and surely we created you and then gave you shape then we told the angel prostrate yourselves to adam and they prostrated except iblis shaytan he refused to be of those who prostrated
Al-Araf,32,0.5574,0.064,0.722,0.214,allah said what prevented you iblis that you did not prostrate when commanded you iblis said am better than him adam you created me from fire and him you created from clay
Al-Araf,27,-0.3818,0.235,0.628,0.137,allah said iblis get down from this paradise it is not for you to be arrogant here get out for you are of those humiliated and disgraced
Al-Araf,16,0.2263,0.0,0.888,0.112,iblis said allow me respite till the day they are raised up the day of resurrection
Al-Araf,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah said you are of those respited
Al-Araf,19,0.5859,0.0,0.78,0.22,iblis said because you have aghwaytni surely will sit in wait against them human being on your straight path
Al-Araf,29,0.5719,0.0,0.883,0.117,then will come to them from before them and behind them from their right and from their left and you will not find most of them to be thankful
Al-Araf,27,0.5106,0.126,0.658,0.216,allah said to iblis get out from this paradise madh uman madhura whoever of them mankind will follow you then surely will fill hell with you all
Al-Araf,29,0.5719,0.0,0.814,0.186,and adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat thereof a you both wish but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,42,0.7321,0.0,0.845,0.155,then shaytan whispered suggestion to them both in order to uncover that which wa hidden from them of their private part before he said your lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angel or become of the immortal
Al-Araf,14,0.5859,0.0,0.714,0.286,and he qasamahuma verily am one of the sincere well wishers for you both
Al-Araf,64,-0.5168,0.127,0.79,0.083,so he misled them with deception then when they tasted of the tree that which wa hidden from them of their shame private part became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaf of paradise and their lord called out to them saying did not forbid you that tree and tell you verily shaytan is an open enemy unto you
Al-Araf,27,-0.6007,0.256,0.608,0.137,they said our lord we have wronged ourselves if you forgive u not and bestow not upon u your mercy we shall certainly be of the loser
Al-Araf,25,0.0516,0.116,0.728,0.156,allah said get down one of you an enemy to the other on earth will be dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for time
Al-Araf,20,-0.5994,0.17,0.83,0.0,he said therein you shall live and therein you shall die and from it you shall be brought out resurrected
Al-Araf,38,0.6369,0.0,0.871,0.129,child of adam we have bestowed libas raiment upon you to cover yourselves with and a rish adornment and the libas raiment of taqwa that is better such are among the ayat of allah that they may remember
Al-Araf,51,0.8644,0.0,0.83,0.17,child of adam let not shaytan deceive you a he got your parent out of paradise stripping them of their raiment to show them their private part verily he and his tribe see you from where you cannot see them verily we made the shayatin friend of those who believe not
Al-Araf,35,0.5574,0.0,0.874,0.126,and when they commit fahishah they say we found our father doing it and allah ha commanded it for u say nay allah never command fahishah do you say about allah what you know not
Al-Araf,43,0.8176,0.0,0.821,0.179,say my lord ha commanded justice and that you should face him only in every masjid and invoke him only making your religion sincere to him a he brought you into being in the beginning so shall you be brought into being again
Al-Araf,28,0.5719,0.082,0.695,0.224,group he ha guided and group deserved to be in error because surely they took the shayatin a supporter instead of allah and think that they are guided
Al-Araf,25,-0.33,0.195,0.653,0.152,child of adam take your adornment to every masjid and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance certainly he allah like not the wasteful
Al-Araf,60,0.7351,0.041,0.811,0.147,say who ha forbidden the adornment with clothes given by allah which he ha produced for his servant and at tayyibat good thing of sustenance say they are in the life of this world for those who believe and exclusively for them believer on the day of resurrection thus we explain the ayat in detail for people who have knowledge
Al-Araf,49,-0.6124,0.206,0.635,0.159,say but the thing that my lord ha indeed forbidden are the fawahish immoral deed whether committed openly or secretly and ithm and transgression without right and joining partner with allah for which he ha given no authority and saying thing about allah of which you have no knowledge
Al-Araf,25,0.5207,0.0,0.841,0.159,and every ummah ha it appointed term when their term come neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour or moment
Al-Araf,34,-0.2062,0.135,0.75,0.115,child of adam if there come to you messenger from among you reciting to you my ayat then whosoever ha taqwa and becomes righteous on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
Al-Araf,23,-0.8047,0.328,0.526,0.146,but those who reject our ayat and treat them with arrogance they are the dweller of the fire they will abide therein forever
Al-Araf,82,-0.8357,0.114,0.849,0.037,who is more unjust than one who invents lie against allah or reject his ayat for such their appointed portion will reach them from the book of decree until our messenger the angel of death and his assistant come to them to take their soul they the angel will say where are those whom you used to invoke and worship besides allah they will reply they have vanished and deserted u and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbeliever
Al-Araf,81,-0.6542,0.088,0.912,0.0,allah will say enter you in the company of nation who passed away before you of men and jinni into the fire every time new nation enters it curse it sister nation that went before until they are all together in the fire the last of them will say to the first of them our lord these misled u so give them double torment of the fire he will say for each one there is double torment but you know not
Al-Araf,27,-0.3412,0.088,0.912,0.0,the first of them will say to the last of them you were not better than u so taste the torment for what you used to earn
Al-Araf,44,-0.6331,0.184,0.707,0.109,verily those who belie our ayat and treat them with arrogance for them the gate of the heaven will not be opened and they will not enter paradise until the jamal go through the eye of the needle thus do we recompense the criminal
Al-Araf,17,-0.34,0.13,0.87,0.0,theirs will be mihad from the fire and over them ghawash thus do we recompense the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,25,0.5267,0.116,0.665,0.219,but those who believed and worked righteousness we burden not any person beyond his scope such are the dweller of paradise they will abide therein
Al-Araf,79,0.9153,0.029,0.798,0.173,and we shall remove from their breast any ghill river flowing under them and they will say all the praise and thanks be to allah who ha guided u to this and never could we have found guidance were it not that allah had guided u indeed the messenger of our lord did come with the truth and it will be cried out to them this is the paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do
Al-Araf,54,0.8779,0.114,0.599,0.287,and the dweller of paradise will call out to the dweller of the fire saying we have indeed found true what our lord had promised u have you also found true what your lord promised warned they shall say yes then crier will proclaim between them the curse of allah is on the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those who hindered men from the path of allah and would seek to make it crooked and they were disbeliever in the hereafter
Al-Araf,54,0.8807,0.02,0.778,0.202,and between them will be barrier screen and on al raf will be men who would recognize all by their mark and they will call out to the dweller of paradise peace be on you and at that time they will not yet have entered it paradise but they will hope to enter it
Al-Araf,27,-0.2732,0.087,0.866,0.047,and when their eye will be turned towards the dweller of the fire they will say our lord place u not with the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Araf,30,-0.1027,0.099,0.814,0.087,and the men on al raf will call unto the men whom they would recognize by their mark saying of what benefit to you wa your gathering and your arrogance
Al-Araf,33,0.3125,0.173,0.624,0.203,are they those of whom you swore that allah would never show them mercy behold it ha been said to them enter paradise no fear shall be on you nor shall you grieve
Al-Araf,39,0.6597,0.109,0.649,0.243,and the dweller of the fire will call to the dweller of paradise pour on u some water or anything that allah ha provided you with they will say both water and provision allah ha forbidden for the disbeliever
Al-Araf,39,-0.3818,0.173,0.714,0.113,who took their religion a amusement and play and the life of the world deceived them so this day we shall forget them a they forgot their meeting of this day and a they used to reject our ayat
Al-Araf,25,0.5994,0.0,0.824,0.176,certainly we have brought to them book the qur an which we have explained in detail with knowledge guidance and mercy to people who believe
Al-Araf,97,-0.0772,0.092,0.801,0.107,await they just for the final fulfillment of the event on the day the event is finally fulfilled those who neglected it before will say verily the messenger of our lord did come with the truth now are there any intercessor for u that they might intercede on our behalf or could we be sent back to the first life of the world so that we might do good deed other than those evil deed which we used to do verily they have lost themselves and that which they used to fabricate ha gone away from them
Al-Araf,64,0.9349,0.0,0.779,0.221,indeed your lord is allah who created the heaven and the earth in six day and then he rose over istawa the throne he brings the night a cover over the day seeking it rapidly and he created the sun the moon the star subjected to his command surely his is the creation and commandment blessed is allah the lord of all that exists
Al-Araf,12,0.4753,0.0,0.71,0.29,invoke your lord tadarru an and khufyah he like not the aggressor
Al-Araf,32,0.8888,0.073,0.569,0.358,and do not do mischief on the earth after it ha been set in order and invoke him with fear and hope surely allah mercy is ever near unto the good doer
Al-Araf,65,-0.6249,0.116,0.81,0.074,and it is he who sends the wind a herald of glad tidings going before his mercy rain till when they have carried heavy laden cloud we drive it to land that is dead then we cause water rain to descend thereon then we produce every kind of fruit therewith similarly we shall raise up the dead so that you may remember or take heed
Al-Araf,38,0.3752,0.109,0.726,0.165,the vegetation of good land come forth easily by the permission of it lord and that which is bad brings forth nothing but little with difficulty thus do we explain variously the ayat for people who give thanks
Al-Araf,30,0.7184,0.141,0.574,0.285,indeed we sent nuh to his people and he said my people worship allah you have no other god but him certainly fear for you the torment of great day
Al-Araf,13,-0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,the leader of his people said verily we see you in plain error
Al-Araf,20,-0.3506,0.161,0.839,0.0,nuh said my people there is no error in me but am messenger from the lord of all that exists
Al-Araf,22,0.4019,0.0,0.886,0.114,convey unto you the message of my lord and give sincere advice to you and know from allah what you know not
Al-Araf,36,0.0772,0.111,0.771,0.118,do you wonder that there ha come to you reminder from your lord through man from among you that he may warn you so that you may fear allah and that you may receive his mercy
Al-Araf,29,-0.6987,0.228,0.666,0.106,but they belied him so we saved him and those along with him in the fulk and we drowned those who belied our ayat they were indeed blind people
Al-Araf,29,0.1406,0.052,0.846,0.102,and to ad the people we sent their brother hud he said my people worship allah you have no other god but him will you then not have taqwa
Al-Araf,26,-0.7269,0.203,0.797,0.0,the leader of those who disbelieved among his people said verily we see you in foolishness and verily we think you are one of the liar
Al-Araf,20,-0.3612,0.163,0.837,0.0,hud said my people there is no foolishness in me but am messenger from the lord of all that exists
Al-Araf,17,0.6908,0.0,0.725,0.275,convey unto you the message of my lord and am trustworthy adviser or well wisher for you
Al-Araf,60,0.8971,0.02,0.786,0.193,do you wonder that there ha come to you reminder and an advice from your lord through man from among you to warn you and remember that he made you successor generation after generation after the people of nuh and increased you amply in stature so remember the grace bestowed upon you from allah so that you may be successful
Al-Araf,37,0.34,0.121,0.7,0.179,they said you have come to u that we should worship allah alone and forsake that which our father used to worship so bring u that wherewith you have threatened u if you are of the truthful
Al-Araf,42,-0.7269,0.158,0.814,0.028,hud said rijs torment and wrath have already fallen on you from your lord dispute you with me over name which you have named you and your father with no authority from allah then wait am with you among those who wait
Al-Araf,31,0.4728,0.071,0.77,0.159,so we saved him and those who were with him out of mercy from u and we severed the root of those who belied our ayat and they were not believer
Al-Araf,63,0.7397,0.095,0.728,0.178,and to thamud people we sent their brother salih he said my people worship allah you have no other god but him indeed there ha come to you clear sign from your lord this she camel of allah is sign unto you so you leave her to graze in allah earth and touch her not with harm lest painful torment should seize you
Al-Araf,50,0.3535,0.046,0.863,0.091,and remember when he made you successor generation after ad and gave you habitation in the land you build for yourselves palace in plain and carve out home in the mountain so remember the grace bestowed upon you from allah and do not go about making mischief on the earth
Al-Araf,46,-0.5719,0.121,0.832,0.048,the leader of those who were arrogant among his people said to those who were counted weak to such of them a believed know you that salih is one sent from his lord they said we indeed believe in that with which he ha been sent
Al-Araf,14,-0.6597,0.31,0.69,0.0,those who were arrogant said verily we disbelieve in that which you believe in
Al-Araf,31,-0.8473,0.22,0.78,0.0,so they killed the she camel and insolently defied the commandment of their lord and said salih bring about your threat if you are indeed one of the messenger of allah
Al-Araf,13,-0.6486,0.264,0.736,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their home
Al-Araf,32,0.8422,0.0,0.762,0.238,then he salih turned from them and said my people have indeed conveyed to you the message of my lord and have given you good advice but you like not good adviser
Al-Araf,25,0.3103,0.074,0.768,0.157,and remember lut when he said to his people do you commit lewdness such a none preceding you ha committed in all of the nation
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily you practice your lust on men instead of woman nay but you are people transgressing beyond bound
Al-Araf,28,-0.5106,0.117,0.841,0.042,and the answer of his people wa only that they said drive them out of your town these are indeed men who want to be pure from sin
Al-Araf,19,0.1531,0.1,0.773,0.127,then we saved him and his family except his wife she wa of the ghabirin those who lagged behind
Al-Araf,18,-0.5267,0.167,0.833,0.0,and we rained down on them rain of stone then see what wa the end of the criminal
Al-Araf,75,0.9103,0.063,0.725,0.212,and to the people of madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said my people worship allah you have no other god but him verily clear proof sign from your lord ha come unto you so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their thing and do not do mischief on the earth after it ha been set in order that will be better for you if you are believer
Al-Araf,46,-0.6652,0.11,0.89,0.0,and sit not on every road threatening and hindering from the path of allah those who believe in him and seeking to make it crooked and remember when you were but few and he multiplied you and see what wa the end of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,37,0.8625,0.0,0.775,0.225,and if there is party of you who belief in that with which have been sent and party who doe not believe so be patient until allah judge between u and he is the best of judge
Al-Araf,45,-0.6705,0.135,0.819,0.047,the chief of those who were arrogant among his people said we shall certainly drive you out shu ayb and those who have believed with you from our town or else you all shall return to our religion he said even though we hate it
Al-Araf,71,0.9186,0.025,0.785,0.19,we should have invented lie against allah if we returned to your religion after allah ha rescued u from it and it is not for u to return to it unless allah our lord should will our lord comprehends all thing in his knowledge in allah alone we put our trust our lord judge between u and our people in truth for you are the best of those who give judgment
Al-Araf,26,-0.2732,0.114,0.808,0.077,the chief of those who disbelieved among his people said to their people if you follow shu ayb be sure then you will be the loser
Al-Araf,13,-0.6486,0.264,0.736,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their home
Al-Araf,25,-0.5267,0.129,0.871,0.0,those who belied shu ayb became a if they had never dwelt there in their home those who belied shu ayb they were the loser
Al-Araf,34,0.0772,0.069,0.853,0.077,then he shu ayb turned from them and said my people have indeed conveyed my lord message unto you and have given you good advice then how can grieve over people who are disbeliever
Al-Araf,30,-0.3716,0.113,0.887,0.0,and we sent no prophet unto any town and they denied him but we seized it people with ba sa and darra so that they might humble themselves to allah
Al-Araf,34,-0.5719,0.228,0.602,0.17,then we changed the evil for the good until they afaw increased and said our father were touched with evil and with good so we seized them all of sudden while they were unaware
Al-Araf,43,-0.09,0.087,0.792,0.121,and if the people of the town had believed and had taqwa certainly we should have opened for them blessing from the heaven and the earth but they belied the messenger so we took them with punishment for what they used to earn
Al-Araf,21,-0.2023,0.13,0.772,0.098,did the people of the town then feel secure against the coming of our punishment by night while they were asleep
Al-Araf,23,-0.0,0.117,0.73,0.153,or did the people of the town then feel secure against the coming of our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing
Al-Araf,21,0.1027,0.13,0.687,0.183,did they then feel secure against allah plan none feel secure from allah plan except the people who are the loser
Al-Araf,37,-0.765,0.159,0.841,0.0,is it not guidance for those who inherit the earth from it previons inhabitant that had we willed we would have punished them for their sin and we seal up their heart so that they hear not
Al-Araf,44,-0.5647,0.092,0.87,0.037,those were the town whose story we relate unto you and there came indeed to them their messenger with clear proof but they were not such who would believe in what they rejected before thus allah doe seal up the heart of the disbeliever
Al-Araf,19,-0.5371,0.208,0.792,0.0,and most of them we found not true to their covenant but most of them we found indeed rebellious
Al-Araf,30,-0.8271,0.216,0.784,0.0,then after them we sent musa with our sign to fir awn and his chief but they wrongfully rejected them so see how wa the end of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and musa said fir awn verily am messenger from the lord of all that exists
Al-Araf,34,0.7469,0.0,0.834,0.166,proper it is for me that say nothing concerning allah but the truth indeed have come unto you from your lord with clear proof so let the child of israel depart along with me
Al-Araf,22,0.3182,0.0,0.901,0.099,fir awn said if you have come with sign show it forth if you are one of those who tell the truth
Al-Araf,13,-0.5574,0.231,0.769,0.0,then musa threw his staff and behold it wa thu ban serpent manifest
Al-Araf,16,0.6808,0.0,0.714,0.286,and he drew out his hand and behold it wa white with radiance for the beholder
Al-Araf,15,0.2732,0.0,0.87,0.13,the chief of the people of fir awn said this is indeed well versed sorcerer
Al-Araf,14,0.0772,0.0,0.909,0.091,he want to get you out of your land so what do you advise
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said put him and his brother off for time and send caller to the city to collect
Al-Araf,9,0.2732,0.0,0.792,0.208,that they bring to you all well versed sorcerer
Al-Araf,23,0.765,0.0,0.752,0.248,and so the sorcerer came to fir awn they said indeed there will be good reward for u if we are the victor
Al-Araf,16,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,he said yes and moreover you will in that case be of the nearest to me
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said musa either you throw first or shall we have the first throw
Al-Araf,27,-0.128,0.196,0.682,0.122,he musa said throw you first so when they threw they bewitched the eye of the people and struck terror into them and they displayed great trick
Al-Araf,22,0.2263,0.0,0.917,0.083,and we revealed to musa saying throw your stick and behold it swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed
Al-Araf,14,0.0258,0.133,0.727,0.139,thus truth wa confirmed and all that they did wa made of no effect
Al-Araf,8,-0.7479,0.515,0.485,0.0,so they were defeated there and returned disgraced
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the sorcerer fell down prostrate
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we believe in the lord of all that exists
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of musa and harun
Al-Araf,35,0.2382,0.0,0.946,0.054,fir awn said you have believed in him musa before gave you permission surely this is plot which you have plotted in the city to drive out it people but you shall come to know
Al-Araf,17,0.6124,0.095,0.631,0.275,surely will cut off your hand and your foot from opposite side then will crucify you all
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said verily we are returning to our lord
Al-Araf,34,-0.5423,0.121,0.836,0.043,and you take vengeance on u only because we believed in the ayat of our lord when they reached u our lord pour out on u patience and cause u to die a muslim
Al-Araf,47,-0.7783,0.199,0.722,0.079,the chief of fir awn people said will you leave musa and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon you and your god he said we will kill their son and let their woman live and we have indeed irresistible power over them
Al-Araf,40,0.765,0.0,0.849,0.151,musa said to his people seek help in allah and be patient verily the earth is allah he give it a heritage to whom he will of his servant and the blessed end is for the pious and righteous person
Al-Araf,44,-0.9001,0.249,0.714,0.037,they said we suffered trouble before you came to u and since you have come to u he said it may be that your lord will destroy your enemy and make you successor on the earth so that he may see how you act
Al-Araf,24,-0.6486,0.194,0.806,0.0,and indeed we punished the people of fir awn with year of drought and lack of fruit crop that they might remember take heed
Al-Araf,42,-0.7579,0.183,0.742,0.075,but whenever good came to them they said this is for u and if evil afflicted them they considered it an omen about musa and those with him be informed verily their omen are with allah but most of them know not
Al-Araf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said to musa whatever ayat you may bring to u to work therewith your sorcery on u we shall never believe in you
Al-Araf,34,-0.7003,0.172,0.781,0.047,so we sent on them the tuwfan the locust the qummal the frog and the blood a succession of manifest sign yet they remained arrogant and they were of those people who were criminal
Al-Araf,44,-0.7269,0.172,0.78,0.047,and when the punishment struck them they said musa invoke your lord for u because of his promise to you if you remove the punishment from u we indeed shall believe in you and we shall let the child of israel go with you
Al-Araf,21,-0.8338,0.295,0.663,0.042,but when we removed the punishment from them for fixed term which they had to reach behold they broke their word
Al-Araf,22,-0.5994,0.157,0.843,0.0,so we took retribution from them we drowned them in the sea because they belied our ayat and were heedless with them
Al-Araf,58,0.4404,0.09,0.778,0.132,and we made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern part of the land and the western part thereof which we have blessed and the fair word of your lord wa fulfilled for the child of israel because of their endurance and we destroyed what fir awn and his people produced and what they erected
Al-Araf,44,0.8316,0.042,0.72,0.238,and we brought the child of israel with safety across the sea and they came upon people devoted to some of their idol in worship they said musa make for u god a they have god he said verily you are an ignorant people
Al-Araf,26,-0.2732,0.182,0.669,0.149,musa added verily these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in idol worship and all that they are doing is in vain
Al-Araf,21,0.7096,0.0,0.723,0.277,he said shall seek for you an ilah god other than allah while he ha given you superiority over the nation
Al-Araf,35,-0.3818,0.183,0.668,0.149,and remember when we rescued you from fir awn people who were afflicting you with the worst torment killing your son and letting your woman live and in that wa great trial from your lord
Al-Araf,48,-0.3612,0.051,0.949,0.0,and we appointed for musa thirty night and added ten and he completed the term appointed by his lord of forty night and musa said to his brother harun replace me among my people act in the right way and follow not the way of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,97,0.1154,0.042,0.912,0.046,and when musa came at the time and place appointed by u and his lord allah spoke to him he said my lord show me yourself that may look upon you allah said you cannot see me but look upon the mountain if it stand still in it place then you shall see me so when his lord appeared to the mountain he made it collapse to dust and musa fell down unconscious then when he recovered his sens he said glory be to you turn to you in repentance and am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,29,0.4588,0.0,0.903,0.097,allah said musa have chosen you above men by my message and by my speaking to you so hold that which have given you and be of the grateful
Al-Araf,42,0.1779,0.049,0.887,0.064,and we wrote for him on the tablet the exhortation all thing and the explanation for all thing and said hold unto these with firmness and enjoin your people to take the better therein shall show you the home of the rebellious
Al-Araf,71,-0.8987,0.166,0.834,0.0,shall turn away from my ayat those who behave arrogantly on the earth without right and even if they see all the ayat they will not believe in them and if they see the way of righteousness they will not adopt it a the way but if they see the way of error they will adopt that way that is because they have rejected our ayat and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,26,-0.6369,0.178,0.822,0.0,those who deny our ayat and the meeting in the hereafter vain are their deed are they requited with anything except what they used to do
Al-Araf,48,0.5267,0.0,0.913,0.087,and the people of musa made in his absence out of their ornament the image of calf for worship it had sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the way they took it for worship and they were wrongdoer
Al-Araf,31,-0.5588,0.222,0.656,0.123,and when they regretted and saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord have not mercy upon u and forgive u we shall certainly be of the loser
Al-Araf,90,-0.9581,0.205,0.758,0.037,and when musa returned to his people angry and grieved he said what an evil thing is that which you have done during my absence did you hasten in matter of your lord and he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him towards him he harun said son of my mother indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me so make not the enemy rejoice over me nor put me among the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Araf,27,0.7845,0.0,0.712,0.288,he musa said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u into your mercy for you are the most merciful of those who show mercy
Al-Araf,32,-0.0258,0.099,0.777,0.123,certainly those who took the calf for worship wrath from their lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of this world thus do we recompense those who invent lie
Al-Araf,24,-0.1531,0.182,0.625,0.193,but those who committed evil deed and then repented afterwards and believed verily your lord after all that is indeed oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Araf,26,-0.4215,0.203,0.647,0.15,and when the anger of musa calmed he took up the tablet and in their inscription wa guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,98,0.5694,0.111,0.745,0.144,and musa chose out of his people seventy of the best men for our appointed time and place of meeting and when they were seized with violent earthquake he said my lord if it had been your will you could have destroyed them and me before would you destroy u for the deed of the foolish among u it is only your trial by which you lead astray whom you will and keep guided whom you will you are our protector so forgive u and have mercy on u for you are the best of those who forgive
Al-Araf,53,0.8126,0.053,0.74,0.207,and ordain for u good in this world and in the hereafter certainly we have hudna unto you he said a to my punishment afflict therewith whom will and my mercy embrace all thing that mercy shall ordain for those who have taqwa and give zakah and those who believe in our ayat
Al-Araf,95,0.1531,0.138,0.711,0.151,those who follow the messenger the prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written of with them in the tawrah and the injil he command them to do good and forbids them from evil he make lawful for them the good thing and forbids them from the evil thing he release them from their heavy burden and from the fetter that were upon them so those who believe in him honor him help him and follow the light which ha been sent down with him it is they who will be successful
Al-Araf,73,-0.5216,0.087,0.857,0.057,say mankind verily am sent to you all a the messenger of allah to whom belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth none ha the right to be worshipped but he it is he who give life and cause death so believe in allah and his messenger the prophet who can neither read nor write who belief in allah and his word and follow him so that you may be guided
Al-Araf,19,0.6908,0.0,0.749,0.251,and of the people of musa there is community who lead the men with truth and establish justice therewith
Al-Araf,83,-0.7269,0.093,0.885,0.022,and we divided them into twelve tribe a distinct nation we revealed to musa when his people asked him for water saying strike the stone with your stick and there gushed forth out of it twelve spring each group knew it own place for water we shaded them with the cloud and sent down upon them the manna and the quail saying eat of the good thing with which we have provided you they harmed u not but they used to harm themselves
Al-Araf,48,0.8934,0.059,0.657,0.284,and remember when it wa said to them dwell in this town jerusalem and eat therefrom wherever you wish and say allah forgive our sin and enter the gate prostrating bowing with humility we shall forgive you your wrongdoing we shall increase the reward for the good doer
Al-Araf,30,0.0772,0.113,0.765,0.122,but those among them who did wrong changed the word that had been told to them so we sent on them torment from the heaven in return for their wrongdoing
Al-Araf,58,-0.4019,0.063,0.918,0.018,and ask them about the town that wa by the sea when they transgressed in the matter of the sabbath when their fish came to them openly on the sabbath day and did not come to them on the day they had no sabbath thus we made trial for them for they used to rebel against allah command
Al-Araf,44,-0.8885,0.264,0.677,0.059,and when community among them said why do you preach to people whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with severe torment the preacher said in order to be free from guilt before your lord allah and perhaps they may fear allah
Al-Araf,36,-0.882,0.27,0.688,0.042,so when they forgot the reminder that had been given to them we rescued those who forbade evil but with severe torment we seized those who did wrong because they used to rebel against allah command
Al-Araf,19,-0.4019,0.13,0.87,0.0,so when they exceeded the limit of what they were prohibited we said to them be you monkey despised
Al-Araf,43,0.6705,0.045,0.798,0.157,and remember when your lord declared that he would certainly keep on sending against them till the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with humiliating torment verily your lord is quick in retribution and certainly he is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Araf,44,-0.34,0.14,0.746,0.114,and we have broken them the jew up into various separate group on the earth some of them are righteous and some are away from that and we tried them with good blessing and evil calamity in order that they might turn to allah
Al-Araf,103,0.8658,0.123,0.675,0.203,then after them succeeded an evil generation which inherited the book but they chose for themselves the good of this low life saying everything will be forgiven to u and if again the offer of the like evil pleasure of this world came their way they would again seize them would commit those sin wa not the covenant of the book taken from them that they would not say about allah anything but the truth and they have studied what is in it the book and the home in the hereafter is better for those who have taqwa do not you then understand
Al-Araf,31,0.1862,0.086,0.777,0.136,and a to those who hold fast to the book act on it teaching and perform the salah certainly we shall never waste the reward of those who do righteous deed
Al-Araf,57,-0.4939,0.055,0.945,0.0,and remember when we nataqna the mountain over them a if it had been canopy and they thought that it wa going to fall on them we said hold firmly to what we have given you the tawrah and remember that which is therein act on it commandment so that you may fear allah and obey him
Al-Araf,49,0.2263,0.036,0.911,0.053,and remember when your lord brought forth from the child of adam from their loin their seed and made them testify a to themselves saying am not your lord they said yes we testify lest you should say on the day of resurrection verily we were unaware of this
Al-Araf,43,-0.3182,0.078,0.872,0.049,or lest you should say it wa only our father aforetime who took others a partner in worship along with allah and we were merely their descendant after them will you then destroy u because of the deed of men who practiced falsehood
Al-Araf,16,0.3182,0.0,0.867,0.133,thus do we explain the ayat in detail so that they may turn unto the truth
Al-Araf,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recite to them the story of him to whom we gave our ayat but he threw them away so shaytan followed him up and he became of those who went astray
Al-Araf,66,-0.6757,0.144,0.784,0.072,and had we willed we would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire so his parable is the parable of dog if you drive him away he pant or if you leave him alone he still pant such is the parable of the people who reject our ayat so relate the story perhaps they may reflect
Al-Araf,16,-0.8957,0.454,0.546,0.0,evil is the parable of the people who rejected our ayat and used to wrong themselves
Al-Araf,19,-0.5267,0.159,0.841,0.0,whomsoever allah guide he is the guided one and whomsoever he sends astray then those they are the loser
Al-Araf,52,-0.0418,0.108,0.771,0.121,and surely we have created many of the jinni and mankind for hell they have heart wherewith they understand not and they have eye wherewith they see not and they have ear wherewith they hear not the truth they are like cattle nay even more astray those they are the heedless one
Al-Araf,35,0.6115,0.031,0.86,0.109,and all the most beautiful name belong to allah so call on him by them and leave the company of those who belie his name they will be requited for what they used to do
Al-Araf,20,0.7717,0.0,0.688,0.312,and of those whom we have created there is community who guide others with the truth and establishes justice therewith
Al-Araf,17,-0.7096,0.282,0.718,0.0,those who reject our ayat we shall gradually seize them with punishment in way they perceive not
Al-Araf,8,0.6908,0.0,0.513,0.487,and respite them certainly my plan is strong
Al-Araf,16,-0.3716,0.202,0.798,0.0,do they not reflect there is no madness in their companion he is but plain warner
Al-Araf,42,0.7717,0.0,0.835,0.165,do they not look in the dominion of the heaven and the earth and all thing that allah ha created and that it may be that the end of their life is near in what message after this will they then believe
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,whomsoever allah sends astray none can guide him and he let them wander blindly in their transgression
Al-Araf,76,0.3506,0.091,0.813,0.096,they ask you about the hour day of resurrection when will be it appointed time say the knowledge thereof is with my lord alone none can reveal it time but he heavy is it burden through the heaven and the earth it shall not come upon you except all of sudden they ask you a if you have good knowledge of it say the knowledge thereof is with allah alone but most of mankind know not
Al-Araf,50,0.4215,0.138,0.694,0.168,say posse no power over benefit or harm to myself except a allah will if had the knowledge of the ghayb unseen should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth and no evil should have touched me am but warner and bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe
Al-Araf,77,0.9618,0.0,0.759,0.241,it is he who ha created you from single person and then he ha created from him his wife in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her when he covered had sexual relation with her she became pregnant and she carried it about lightly then when it became heavy they both invoked allah their lord saying if you give u salih good in every aspect child we shall indeed be among the grateful
Al-Araf,34,0.4767,0.0,0.912,0.088,but when he gave them salih child they ascribed partner to him allah in that which he ha given to them high be allah exalted above all that they ascribe a partner to him
Al-Araf,16,0.4588,0.0,0.765,0.235,do they attribute a partner to allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created
Al-Araf,11,0.4939,0.141,0.513,0.346,no help can they give them nor can they help themselves
Al-Araf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you call them to guidance they follow you not it is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent
Al-Araf,25,0.6705,0.0,0.807,0.193,verily those whom you call upon besides allah are servant like you so call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful
Al-Araf,45,0.25,0.045,0.888,0.066,have they foot wherewith they walk or have they hand wherewith they hold or have they eye wherewith they see or have they ear wherewith they hear say call your so called partner of allah and then plot against me and give me no respite
Al-Araf,18,0.5719,0.0,0.773,0.227,verily my protector is allah who ha revealed the book the qur an and he protects the righteous
Al-Araf,17,-0.5448,0.231,0.769,0.0,and those whom you call upon besides him allah cannot help you nor can they help themselves
Al-Araf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you call them to guidance they hear not and you will see them looking at you yet they see not
Al-Araf,16,-0.128,0.244,0.533,0.222,show forgiveness enjoin al urf the good and turn away from the foolish don punish them
Al-Araf,22,-0.6597,0.173,0.827,0.0,and if an evil whisper come to you from shaytan then seek refuge with allah verily he is all hearer all knower
Al-Araf,23,-0.6597,0.167,0.833,0.0,verily those who have taqwa when an evil thought come to them from shaytan they remember allah and indeed they then see aright
Al-Araf,21,-0.947,0.462,0.469,0.068,but a for their brother the devil brother they the devil plunge them deeper into error and they never stop short
Al-Araf,46,0.2991,0.041,0.893,0.066,and if you do not bring them miracle they say why have you not brought it say but follow what is revealed to me from my lord this the qur an is nothing but evidence from your lord and guidance and mercy for people who believe
Al-Araf,18,0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,so when the qur an is recited listen to it and be silent that you may receive mercy
Al-Araf,30,-0.7351,0.181,0.819,0.0,and remember your lord within yourself humbly and with fear and without loudness in word in the morning and in the afternoon and be not of those who are neglectful
Al-Araf,29,0.914,0.045,0.611,0.344,surely those who are with your lord angel are never too proud to perform act of worship to him but they glorify his praise and prostrate themselves before him
Al-Anfal,42,-0.5859,0.087,0.889,0.024,they ask you about al anfal the spoil of war say al anfal are for allah and the messenger so have taqwa of allah and settle all matter of difference among you and obey allah and his messenger if you are believer
Al-Anfal,35,0.6369,0.075,0.728,0.197,the believer are only those who when allah is mentioned feel fear in their heart and when his ayat are recited unto them they increase their faith and they put their trust in their lord
Al-Anfal,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who perform the salah and spend out of what we have provided them
Al-Anfal,24,0.9274,0.0,0.565,0.435,it is they who are the believer in truth for them are grade of dignity with their lord and forgiveness and generous provision paradise
Al-Anfal,22,0.3182,0.105,0.7,0.195,a your lord caused you to go out from your home with the truth and verily party among the believer disliked it
Al-Anfal,25,-0.6486,0.221,0.702,0.077,disputing with you concerning the truth after it wa made manifest a if they were being driven to death while they were looking at it
Al-Anfal,46,0.4404,0.052,0.82,0.128,and remember when allah promised you muslim one of the two party that it should be yours you wished that the one not armed should be yours but allah willed to justify the truth by his word and to cut off the root of the disbeliever
Al-Anfal,19,-0.4019,0.258,0.545,0.196,that he might cause the truth to triumph and bring falsehood to nothing even though the criminal hate it
Al-Anfal,22,0.6597,0.0,0.787,0.213,remember when you sought help of your lord and he answered you saying will help you with thousand of the angel murdifin
Al-Anfal,29,0.5994,0.066,0.751,0.183,allah made it only a glad tidings and that your heart be at rest therewith and there is no victory except from allah verily allah is almighty all wise
Al-Anfal,50,0.6124,0.044,0.821,0.135,remember when he covered you with slumber a security from him and he caused water rain to descend on you from the sky to clean you thereby and to remove from you the rijz whispering or dirt of shaytan and to strengthen your heart and make your foot firm thereby
Al-Anfal,44,-0.6588,0.114,0.886,0.0,remember when your lord revealed to the angel verily am with you so keep firm those who have believed will cast terror into the heart of those who have disbelieved so strike them over the neck and smite over all their finger and toe
Al-Anfal,27,-0.7003,0.188,0.812,0.0,this is because they defied and disobeyed allah and his messenger and whoever defies and disobeys allah and his messenger then verily allah is severe in punishment
Al-Anfal,18,0.128,0.113,0.751,0.136,this is the torment so taste it and surely for the disbeliever is the torment of the fire

Hud,30,-0.7783,0.195,0.805,0.0,he will go ahead of his people on the day of resurrection and will lead them into the fire and evil indeed is the place to which they are led

Hud,26,-0.9325,0.417,0.583,0.0,such is the punishment of your lord when he seizes the population of town while they are doing wrong verily his punishment is painful and severe
Hud,34,-0.2263,0.085,0.853,0.061,indeed in that there is sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the hereafter that is day whereon mankind will be gathered together and that is day when all will be present

Hud,16,0.6956,0.0,0.709,0.291,and your lord would never destroy the town wrongfully while their people were doer of good
Hud,22,0.5756,0.0,0.809,0.191,and if your lord had so willed he could surely have made mankind one ummah but they will not cease to disagree
Hud,38,0.8176,0.091,0.611,0.298,except him on whom your lord ha bestowed his mercy and for that did he create them and the word of your lord ha been fulfilled his saying surely shall fill hell with jinni and men all together
Hud,45,0.8573,0.0,0.789,0.211,and all that we relate to you of the news of the messenger is in order that we may make strong and firm your heart thereby and in this ha come to you the truth a well a an admonition and reminder for the believer

Yusuf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily we have sent it down a an arabic qur an in order that you may understand
Yusuf,29,0.6369,0.0,0.87,0.13,we relate unto you the best of story through our revelation unto you of this qur an and before this you were among those who knew nothing about it
Yusuf,27,0.25,0.0,0.929,0.071,remember when yusuf said to his father my father verily saw in dream eleven star and the sun and the moon saw them prostrating themselves to me
Yusuf,28,-0.6416,0.168,0.832,0.0,he the father said my son relate not your vision to your brother lest they should arrange plot against you verily shaytan is to man an open enemy
Yusuf,48,0.9349,0.0,0.734,0.266,thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of dream and other thing and perfect his favor on you and on the offspring of ya qub a he perfected it on your father ibrahim and ishaq aforetime verily your lord is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily in yusuf and his brother there were ayat for those who ask
Yusuf,27,0.4767,0.083,0.738,0.178,when they said truly yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we while we are usbah group really our father is in plain error
Yusuf,31,-0.577,0.178,0.743,0.079,kill yusuf or cast him out to some other land so that the favor of your father may be given to you alone and after that you will be righteous folk
Yusuf,32,-0.0516,0.08,0.845,0.075,one from among them said kill not yusuf but if you must do something throw him down to the bottom of well he will be picked up by some caravan of traveler
Yusuf,19,-0.1536,0.13,0.769,0.101,they said our father why do you not trust u with yusuf though we are indeed his well wishers
Yusuf,18,0.8316,0.0,0.614,0.386,send him with u tomorrow to enjoy himself and play and verily we will take care of him
Yusuf,26,-0.6908,0.257,0.657,0.087,he ya qub said truly it saddens me that you should take him away fear lest wolf should devour him while you are careless of him
Yusuf,17,-0.128,0.16,0.704,0.136,they said if wolf devours him while we are usbah group then surely we are the loser
Yusuf,40,0.4939,0.0,0.9,0.1,so when they took him away they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well and we revealed to him indeed you shall one day inform them of this their affair when they know you not
Yusuf,14,-0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,and they came to their father in the early part of the night weeping
Yusuf,32,0.4497,0.0,0.91,0.09,they said our father we went racing with one another and left yusuf by our belonging and wolf devoured him but you will never believe u even when we speak the truth
Yusuf,43,0.2617,0.053,0.871,0.075,and they brought his shirt stained with false blood he said nay but your own self have made up tale so for me patience is most fitting and it is allah alone whose help can be sought against that lie which you describe
Yusuf,46,0.5141,0.034,0.863,0.103,and there came caravan of traveler and they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket into the well he said what good news here is boy so they hid him a merchandise slave and allah wa the all knower of what they did
Yusuf,19,-0.34,0.118,0.882,0.0,and they sold him for bakhs price for few dirham and they were of those who regarded him insignificant
Yusuf,62,0.631,0.0,0.887,0.113,and he the man from egypt who bought him said to his wife make his stay comfortable maybe he will profit u or we shall adopt him a son thus did we establish yusuf in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of event and allah ha full power and control over his affair but most of men know not
Yusuf,23,0.875,0.0,0.667,0.333,and when he yusuf attained his full manhood we gave him wisdom and knowledge the prophethood thus we reward the doer of good
Yusuf,51,0.2565,0.119,0.73,0.151,and she in whose house he wa sought to seduce him to do an evil act and she closed the door and said come on you he said seek refuge in allah truly he is my rabb he made my living in great comfort verily the wrongdoer will never be successful
Yusuf,45,-0.1779,0.142,0.71,0.147,and indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her desire had he not seen the evidence of his lord thus it wa that we might turn away from him evil and immoval sin surely he wa one of our mukhlasin servant
Yusuf,54,-0.93,0.216,0.784,0.0,so they raced with one another to the door and she tore his shirt from the back they both found her master her husband at the door she said what is the recompense punishment for him who intended an evil design against your wife except that he be put in prison or painful torment
Yusuf,39,-0.5423,0.162,0.776,0.062,he yusuf said it wa she that sought to seduce me and witness of her household bore witness saying if it be that his shirt is torn from the front then her tale is true and he is liar
Yusuf,23,0.5499,0.088,0.701,0.212,but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back then she ha told lie and he is speaking the truth
Yusuf,29,0.5106,0.06,0.781,0.159,so when he her husband saw his yusuf shirt torn at the back he her husband said surely it is plot of you woman certainly mighty is your plot
Yusuf,17,-0.7269,0.309,0.601,0.09,yusuf turn away from this woman ask forgiveness for your sin verily you were of the sinful
Yusuf,31,-0.3182,0.168,0.724,0.109,and woman in the city said the wife of the aziz is seeking to seduce her slave young man indeed she love him violently verily we see her in plain error
Yusuf,67,0.7022,0.109,0.734,0.157,so when she heard of their accusation she sent for them and prepared banquet for them she gave each one of them knife and she said to yusuf come out before them then when they saw him they exalted him at his beauty and in their astonishment cut their hand they said how perfect is allah no man is this this is none other than noble angel
Yusuf,48,-0.9127,0.259,0.69,0.051,she said this is he the young man about whom you did blame me and did seek to seduce him but he refused and now if he refuse to obey my order he shall certainly be cast into prison and will be one of those who are disgraced
Yusuf,35,-0.2263,0.132,0.758,0.11,he said my lord prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me unless you turn away their plot from me will feel inclined towards them and be one of the ignorant
Yusuf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot verily he is the all hearer the all knower
Yusuf,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,then it occurred to them after they had seen the proof of his innocence to imprison him for time
Yusuf,60,0.3818,0.051,0.844,0.106,and there entered with him two young men in the prison one of them said verily saw myself in dream pressing wine the other said verily saw myself in dream carrying bread on my head and bird were eating thereof they said inform u of the interpretation of this verily we think you are one of the doer of good
Yusuf,47,-0.3612,0.108,0.832,0.06,he said no food will come to you a your provision but will inform it interpretation before it come this is of that which my lord ha taught me verily have abandoned the religion of people that believe not in allah and are disbeliever in the hereafter
Yusuf,40,0.6775,0.0,0.869,0.131,and have followed the religion of my father ibrahim ishaq and ya qub and never could we attribute any partner whatsoever to allah this is from the grace of allah to u and to mankind but most men thank not
Yusuf,17,0.4767,0.139,0.549,0.312,two companion of the prison are many different lord god better or allah the one the irresistible
Yusuf,52,0.5305,0.107,0.731,0.162,you do not worship besides him but only name which you have named forged you and your father for which allah ha sent down no authority the command is for none but allah he ha commanded that you worship none but him that is the straight religion but most men know not
Yusuf,47,-0.5106,0.07,0.93,0.0,two companion of the prison a for one of you he will pour out wine for his master to drink and a for the other he will be crucified and bird will eat from his head thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire
Yusuf,36,-0.7096,0.163,0.791,0.046,and he said to the one whom he knew to be saved mention me to your king but shaytan made him forget to mention it to his master so yusuf stayed in prison few more year
Yusuf,43,0.6124,0.0,0.87,0.13,and the king of egypt said verily saw in dream seven fat cow whom seven lean one were devouring and seven green ear of corn and seven others dry notable explain to me my dream if it be that you can interpret dream
Yusuf,16,0.4588,0.0,0.778,0.222,they said mixed up false dream and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dream

Yusuf,29,-0.5214,0.107,0.893,0.0,and when they went in before yusuf he took his brother binyamin to himself and said verily am your brother so grieve not for what they used to do
Yusuf,28,-0.4767,0.177,0.737,0.086,so when he furnished them forth with their provision he put the bowl in his brother bag then crier cried you in the caravan surely you are thief

Yusuf,26,-0.1655,0.062,0.938,0.0,he said allah forbid that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property indeed if we did so we should be wrongdoer
Yusuf,65,-0.4794,0.101,0.826,0.072,so when they despaired of him they consulted in private the eldest among them said know you not that your father did take an oath from you in allah name and before this you did fail in your duty with yusuf therefore will not leave this land until my father permit me or allah decides my case and he is the best of the judge

Yusuf,93,0.9659,0.029,0.741,0.23,and he raised his parent to the arsh and they fell down before him prostrate and he said my father this is the interpretation of my dream aforetime my lord ha made it come true he wa indeed good to me when he took me out of the prison and brought you all here out of the bedouin life after shaytan had sown enmity between me and my brother certainly my lord is the most courteous and kind unto whom he will truly he only he is the all knowing the all wise

Al-Kahf,85,0.5574,0.024,0.911,0.064,likewise we woke them that they might question one another speaker among them said how long have you stayed here they said we have stayed day or part of day they said your lord know best how long you have stayed here so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him find out which is the azka food and bring some of that to you and let him be careful and let no man know of you
Al-Kahf,28,-0.4717,0.102,0.898,0.0,for if they come to know of you they will stone you or turn you back to their religion and in that case you will never be successful
Al-Kahf,67,0.8442,0.087,0.726,0.187,and thus we made their case known that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that there can be no doubt about the hour remember when they the people disputed among themselves about their case they said construct building over them their lord know best about them then those who won their point said we verily shall build place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,71,0.7311,0.0,0.905,0.095,they say they were three the dog being the fourth among them and they say they were five the dog being the sixth guessing at the unseen and they say they were seven and the dog being the eighth say my lord know best their number none know them but few so debate not except with the clear proof and consult not any of them about the people of the cave
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and never say of anything shall do such and such thing tomorrow
Al-Kahf,31,0.1027,0.057,0.873,0.069,except with the saying if allah will and remember your lord when you forget and say it may be that my lord guide me to nearer way of truth than this
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they stayed in their cave three hundred year adding nine
Al-Kahf,45,0.7971,0.075,0.737,0.188,say allah know best how long they stayed with him is the unseen of the heaven and the earth how clearly he see and hears everything they have no protector other than him and he make none to share in his decision and his rule
Al-Kahf,28,0.34,0.0,0.915,0.085,and recite what ha been revealed to you muhammad of your lord book none can change his word and none will you find a refuge other than him
Al-Kahf,61,0.0258,0.036,0.926,0.038,and keep yourself muhammad patiently with those who call on their lord morning and afternoon seeking his face and let not your eye overlook them desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world and obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his own lust and whose affair ha been lost
Al-Kahf,61,-0.6597,0.164,0.718,0.118,and say the truth is from your lord then whosoever will let him believe and whosoever will let him disbelieve verily we have prepared for the wrongdoer fire whose wall will be surrounding them and if they ask for drink they will be granted water like al muhl that will scald their face terrible is the drink and an evil murtafaq
Al-Kahf,32,0.2721,0.137,0.698,0.165,verily a for those who believed and did righteous deed certainly we shall not make the reward of anyone to be lost who doe his righteous deed in the most perfect manner
Al-Kahf,50,0.9022,0.0,0.792,0.208,these for them will be jannatu adn wherein river flow beneath them therein they will be adorned with bracelet of gold and they will wear green garment of sundus and istabraq they will be muttaki in therein on ara ik how good is the reward and what an excellent murtafaq
Al-Kahf,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and put forward to them the example of two men unto one of them we had given two garden of grape and we had surrounded both with date palm and had put between them green crop cultivated field
Al-Kahf,28,-0.5106,0.109,0.891,0.0,each of those two garden brought forth it produce and failed not in the least therein and we caused river to gush forth in the midst of both
Al-Kahf,25,0.6908,0.0,0.801,0.199,and he had thamar and he said to his companion in the course of discussion am greater than you in wealth and have mightier entourage
Al-Kahf,22,-0.5106,0.136,0.864,0.0,and he went into his garden while having been unjust to himself he said do not think that this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,28,0.7003,0.0,0.818,0.182,and do not think the hour will ever come and if indeed am brought back to my lord surely shall find better than this when return to him
Al-Kahf,28,-0.0516,0.073,0.861,0.066,his companion said to him during his discussion do you disbelieve in him who created you out of dust then out of nutfah then fashioned you into man
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but a for my part believe that he is allah my lord and none shall associate a partner with my lord
Al-Kahf,34,0.6858,0.041,0.798,0.161,it wa better for you to say when you entered your garden that which allah will there is no power but with allah if you see me le than you in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,31,0.4404,0.0,0.909,0.091,it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and will send on it husban from the sky then it will be a barren slippery earth
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or the water thereof becomes ghawran so that you will never be able to seek it
Al-Kahf,41,-0.7184,0.186,0.749,0.065,so his fruit were encircled with ruin and began yuqallibu his hand over what he had spent upon it while it wa all destroyed on it trellis and he could only say would that had ascribed no partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,19,0.5719,0.091,0.664,0.245,and he had no group of men to help him against allah nor could he defend or save himself
Al-Kahf,30,0.9432,0.047,0.558,0.395,there on the day of resurrection al walayah will be for allah alone the true god he allah is the best for reward and the best for the final end
Al-Kahf,53,-0.4118,0.072,0.869,0.059,and mention the parable of the worldly life it is like the water which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and becomes fresh and green but later it becomes dry and broken piece which the wind scatter and allah is able to do everything
Al-Kahf,30,0.9756,0.0,0.487,0.513,wealth and child are the adornment of the life of this world but the good righteous deed that last are better with your lord for reward and better for hope
Al-Kahf,36,-0.0516,0.034,0.966,0.0,and remember the day we shall cause the mountain to pas away and you will see the earth a levelled plain and we shall gather them so that we will leave not one of them behind
Al-Kahf,40,-0.3182,0.071,0.891,0.038,and they will be set before your lord aligned he will say now indeed you have come to u a we created you the first time nay but you thought that we had appointed no meeting for you with u
Al-Kahf,61,-0.714,0.189,0.701,0.109,and the book will be produced and you will see the criminal fearful of that which is therein they will say woe to u what sort of book is this that leaf neither small thing nor large thing but ha recorded it with number and they will find all that they did present and your lord treat no one with injustice
Al-Kahf,61,-0.7579,0.117,0.847,0.036,and remember when we said to the angel prostrate yourselves unto adam so they prostrated themselves except iblis he wa one of the jinni he disobeyed the command of his lord will you then take him and his offspring a protector and helper rather than me while they are enemy to you what an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoer
Al-Kahf,24,0.171,0.135,0.743,0.123,they did not witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor their own creation nor did take those who mislead a adudan
Al-Kahf,36,-0.2617,0.055,0.945,0.0,and remember the day he will say call those so called partner of mine whom you claimed then they will cry unto them but they will not answer them and we shall put mawbiq between them
Al-Kahf,25,-0.743,0.261,0.684,0.055,and the criminal shall see the fire and apprehend that they are to fall therein and they will find no way of escape from it
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed we have given every kind of example in this qur an for mankind but man is ever more quarrelsome than anything
Al-Kahf,41,0.507,0.028,0.869,0.103,and nothing prevents men from believing while the guidance ha come to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that the way of the ancient be repeated with them or the torment be brought to them face to face
Al-Kahf,41,-0.5647,0.176,0.722,0.101,and we send not the messenger except a bearer of good news and warner but those who disbelieve argue with falsehood in order to refute the truth thereby and they take my ayat and that which they are warned for jest
Al-Kahf,64,0.7878,0.031,0.855,0.114,and who doe more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayat sign of his lord but turn away from them forgetting what his hand have sent forth truly we have set over their heart akinnah lest they should understand this the qur an and in their ear deafness and if you call them to guidance even then they will never be guided
Al-Kahf,42,0.2374,0.101,0.739,0.161,and your lord is most forgiving owner of mercy were he to call them to account for what they have earned then surely he would have hastened their punishment but they have their appointed time beyond which they will find no escape
Al-Kahf,18,-0.875,0.4,0.6,0.0,and these town we destroyed them when they did wrong and we appointed fixed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,24,0.0258,0.0,0.954,0.046,and remember when musa said to his boy servant will not give up until reach the junction of the two sea or huqub pass
Al-Kahf,25,0.1531,0.0,0.935,0.065,but when they reached the junction of the two sea they forgot their fish and it took it way through the sea a in tunnel
Al-Kahf,26,-0.0772,0.11,0.79,0.1,so when they passed further on musa said to his boy servant bring u our morning meal truly we have suffered nasaban in this our journey
Al-Kahf,35,-0.5499,0.121,0.879,0.0,he said do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock indeed forgot the fish none but shaytan made me forget to remember it it took it course into the sea in strange way
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said that is what we have been seeking so they went back retracing their footstep
Al-Kahf,23,0.3612,0.0,0.889,0.111,then they found one of our servant on whom we had bestowed mercy from u and whom we had taught knowledge from u
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said to him may follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge which you have been taught by allah
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said verily you will not be able to have patience with me
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how can you have patience about thing which you know not
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said if allah will you will find me patient and will not disobey you in aught
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said then if you follow me ask me not about anything till myself mention of it to you
Al-Kahf,31,-0.8126,0.246,0.699,0.054,so they both proceeded till when they boarded the boat he khidr damaged it musa said have you damaged it wherein it people will drown verily you have committed thing imr
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with me
Al-Kahf,21,0.0762,0.0,0.939,0.061,he said call me not to account for what forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair with you
Al-Kahf,29,-0.7579,0.234,0.649,0.117,then they both proceeded till they met boy and he khidr killed him musa said have you killed an innocent person without nafs verily you have committed thing nukr
Al-Kahf,14,-0.296,0.145,0.855,0.0,he said did not tell you that you can have no patience with me
Al-Kahf,21,0.0772,0.0,0.939,0.061,he said if ask you anything after this keep me not in your company you have received an excuse from me
Al-Kahf,52,0.2617,0.112,0.743,0.145,then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of town they asked them for food but they refused to entertain them then they found therein wall about to collapse and he set it up straight musa said if you had wished surely you could have taken wage for it
Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this is the parting between you and will tell you the interpretation of those thing over which you were not able to be patient
Al-Kahf,33,-0.8481,0.247,0.753,0.0,a for the boat it belonged to poor people working in the sea so wished to make defective damage in it a there wa king behind them who seized every boat by force
Al-Kahf,20,-0.5719,0.217,0.783,0.0,and a for the boy his parent were believer and we feared he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief
Al-Kahf,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,so we intended that their lord should exchange him for them for one better in righteousness and nearer to mercy
Al-Kahf,74,0.8442,0.0,0.871,0.129,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the town and there wa under it treasure belonging to them and their father wa righteous man and your lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure a mercy from your lord and did them not of my own accord that is the interpretation of those thing over which you could not be patient
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you about dhul qarnayn say shall recite to you something of his story
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily we established him in the earth and we gave him the mean of everything
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he followed way
Al-Kahf,38,0.4019,0.076,0.764,0.16,until when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in spring of hami ah and he found near it people we said dhul qarnayn either you punish them or treat them with kindness
Al-Kahf,30,-0.9559,0.423,0.577,0.0,he said a for him who doe wrong we shall punish him and then he will be brought back unto his lord who will punish him with terrible torment hell
Al-Kahf,23,0.9161,0.0,0.648,0.352,but a for him who belief and work righteousness he shall have the best reward and we shall speak unto him mild word
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed another way
Al-Kahf,28,-0.296,0.075,0.925,0.0,until when he came to the rising place of the sun he found it rising on people for whom we allah had provided no shelter against the sun
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so it wa and we knew all about him dhul qarnayn
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed another way
Al-Kahf,16,0.1027,0.0,0.915,0.085,until when he reached between two mountain he found before them people who scarcely understood word
Al-Kahf,34,0.1779,0.14,0.753,0.106,they said dhul qarnayn verily ya juj and ma juj are doing great mischief in the land shall we then pay you tribute in order that you might erect barrier between u and them
Al-Kahf,24,0.8439,0.048,0.643,0.308,he said that in which my lord had established me is better so help me with strength will erect between you and them barrier
Al-Kahf,39,-0.34,0.061,0.939,0.0,give me zubar of iron then when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain cliff he said blow then when he had made them red a fire he said bring me qitran to pour over them
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they could not scale it or dig through it
Al-Kahf,33,0.8847,0.0,0.719,0.281,he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord come he shall dakka it down to the ground and the promise of my lord is ever true
Al-Kahf,32,0.3182,0.036,0.89,0.074,and on that day we shall leave some of them to surge like wave on one another and the trumpet will be blown and we shall collect them the creature all together
Al-Kahf,14,-0.6808,0.261,0.739,0.0,and on that day we shall present hell to the disbeliever plain to view
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to those whose eye had been under covering from my reminder and they could not bear to hear it
Al-Kahf,28,-0.2263,0.142,0.712,0.146,do then those who disbelieved think that they can take my servant a awliya protector besides me verily we have prepared hell a an entertainment for the disbeliever
Al-Kahf,13,0.5994,0.164,0.483,0.353,say shall we tell you the greatest loser in respect of their deed
Al-Kahf,20,-0.0772,0.133,0.747,0.12,those whose effort have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deed
Al-Kahf,34,-0.7506,0.193,0.807,0.0,they are those who deny the ayat of their lord and the meeting with him so their work are in vain and on the day of resurrection we shall assign no weight for them
Al-Kahf,18,-0.6808,0.213,0.787,0.0,that shall be their recompense hell because they disbelieved and took my ayat and my messenger for jest
Al-Kahf,18,0.4215,0.0,0.859,0.141,verily those who believe and do righteous deed shall have the garden of al firdaws for their entertainment
Al-Kahf,13,0.25,0.134,0.61,0.256,wherein they shall dwell forever no desire will they have for removal therefrom
Al-Kahf,36,0.4404,0.061,0.807,0.132,say if the sea were ink for the word of my lord surely the sea would be exhausted before the word of my lord would be finished even if we brought like it for it aid
Al-Kahf,42,0.9096,0.0,0.707,0.293,say am only man like you it ha been revealed to me that your god is one god so whoever hope for the meeting with his lord let him work righteousness and associate none a partner in the worship of his lord

Ta-Ha,40,0.6369,0.0,0.903,0.097,then they both ate of the tree and so their private part became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaf of the paradise for their covering thus adam disobeyd his lord so he went astray
Ta-Ha,15,0.2732,0.0,0.87,0.13,then his lord chose him and turned to him with forgiveness and gave him guidance

An-Naml,25,-0.25,0.077,0.923,0.0,he said disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided or she will be one of those not guided
An-Naml,39,0.3612,0.0,0.933,0.067,so when she came it wa said is your throne like this she said a though it were the very same and he said knowledge wa bestowed on u before her and we had submitted to allah a muslim
An-Naml,21,0.5719,0.0,0.759,0.241,and saddaha that which she used to worship besides allah ha prevented her from islam for she wa of disbelieving people

An-Naml,31,0.7959,0.0,0.776,0.224,and say all the praise and thanks be to allah he will show you his ayat and you shall recognize them and your lord is not unaware of what you do
Al-Qasas,3,-0.5574,0.643,0.357,0.0,ta sin mim
Al-Qasas,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,these are the ayat of the manifest book
Al-Qasas,19,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,we recite to you some of the news of musa and fir awn in truth for people who believe
Al-Qasas,32,-0.8481,0.241,0.759,0.0,verily fir awn exalted himself in the land and made it people shiya weakening group among them killing their son and letting their female live verily he wa of the mischief maker
Al-Qasas,25,-0.0516,0.101,0.804,0.094,and we wished to do favor to those who were weak in the land and to make them ruler and to make them the inheritor
Al-Qasas,24,-0.4939,0.122,0.878,0.0,and to establish them in the land and we let fir awn and haman and their army receive from them that which they feared
Al-Qasas,43,-0.8694,0.21,0.75,0.04,and we inspired the mother of musa suckle him musa but when you fear for him then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve verily we shall bring him back to you and shall make him one of the messenger
Al-Qasas,30,-0.7717,0.193,0.807,0.0,then the household of fir awn picked him up that he might become for them an enemy and cause of grief verily fir awn haman and their army were sinner
Al-Qasas,38,0.128,0.107,0.729,0.164,and the wife of fir awn said comfort of the eye for me and for you kill him not perhaps he may be of benefit to u or we may adopt him a son and they perceived not
Al-Qasas,34,-0.4822,0.118,0.882,0.0,and the heart of the mother of musa became empty she wa very near to disclose his case had we not strengthened her heart so that she might remain a one of the believer
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to his sister follow him so she watched him from far place secretly while they perceived not
Al-Qasas,31,0.0258,0.081,0.836,0.084,and we had already forbidden foster suckling mother for him until she said shall direct you to household who will rear him for you and look after him in good manner
Al-Qasas,37,0.7079,0.0,0.783,0.217,so we restored him to his mother that her eye might be comforted and that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of allah is true but most of them know not
Al-Qasas,24,0.7906,0.0,0.724,0.276,and when he reached maturity and wa complete we bestowed on him hukm and knowledge and thus do we reward the doer of good
Al-Qasas,63,-0.9198,0.27,0.632,0.098,and he entered the city when it people were unaware and he found there two men fighting one of his party and the other of his foe the man of his own party asked him for help against his foe so musa struck him with his fist and he died he said this is of shaytan doing verily he is plain misleading enemy
Al-Qasas,24,0.5849,0.095,0.654,0.251,he said my lord verily have wronged myself so forgive me then he forgave him verily he is the oft forgiving the most merciful
Al-Qasas,19,0.2023,0.138,0.65,0.211,he said my lord for that with which you have favored me will nevermore be helper of the criminal
Al-Qasas,35,0.6597,0.0,0.859,0.141,so he became afraid looking about in the city when behold the man who had sought his help the day before called for his help again musa said to him verily you are plain misleader
Al-Qasas,53,-0.7814,0.138,0.862,0.0,then when he decided to seize the man who wa an enemy to both of them the man said musa is it your intention to kill me a you killed man yesterday your aim is nothing but to become tyrant in the land and not to be one of those who do right
Al-Qasas,38,0.3338,0.1,0.727,0.173,and there came man running from the farthest end of the city he said musa verily the chief are taking counsel together about you to kill you so escape truly am one of the good adviser to you
Al-Qasas,23,0.0,0.117,0.766,0.117,so he escaped from there looking about in state of fear he said my lord save me from the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he went towards madyan he said it may be that my lord guide me to the right way
Al-Qasas,57,0.0258,0.0,0.981,0.019,and when he arrived at the water of madyan he found there group of men watering and besides them he found two woman who were keeping back their flock he said what is the matter with you they said we cannot water our flock until the shepherd take their flock and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,29,0.7003,0.0,0.823,0.177,so he watered their flock for them then he turned back to shade and said my lord truly am in need of whatever good that you bestow on me
Al-Qasas,53,-0.0516,0.085,0.851,0.064,then there came to him one of them walking shyly she said verily my father call you that he may reward you for having watered our flock for u so when he came to him and narrated the story he said fear you not you have escaped from the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,26,0.9022,0.0,0.674,0.326,and said one of them the two woman my father hire him verily the best of men for you to hire is the strong the trustworthy
Al-Qasas,54,0.1154,0.053,0.887,0.061,he said intend to wed one of these two daughter of mine to you on condition that you serve me for eight year but if you complete ten year it will be favor from you but intend not to place you under difficulty if allah will you will find me one of the righteous
Al-Qasas,31,-0.25,0.156,0.714,0.13,he musa said that is settled between me and you whichever of the two term fulfill there will be no injustice to me and allah is surety over what we say
Al-Qasas,48,-0.0258,0.09,0.822,0.088,then when musa had fulfilled the term and wa traveling with his family he saw fire in the direction of at tur he said to his family wait have seen fire perhaps may bring to you from there some information or burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,32,0.6771,0.0,0.844,0.156,so when he reached it he wa called from the right side of the valley in the blessed place from the tree musa verily am allah the lord of all that exists
Al-Qasas,40,-0.296,0.097,0.833,0.07,and throw your stick but when he saw it moving a if it were snake he turned in flight and looked not back it wa said musa draw near and fear not verily you are of those who are secure
Al-Qasas,51,0.6486,0.088,0.753,0.159,put your hand into the opening of your garment it will come forth white without disease and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear these are two proof from your lord to fir awn and his chief verily they are the people who are rebellious
Al-Qasas,16,-0.9246,0.488,0.512,0.0,he said my lord have killed man among them and fear that they will kill me
Al-Qasas,29,-0.4939,0.17,0.758,0.073,and my brother harun he is more eloquent in speech than me so send him with me a helper to confirm me verily fear that they will deny me
Al-Qasas,40,-0.0258,0.082,0.816,0.103,allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and give you both power so they shall not be able to harm you with our ayat you two a well a those who follow you will be the victor
Al-Qasas,29,0.2023,0.0,0.94,0.06,then when musa came to them with our clear ayat they said this is nothing but invented magic never did we hear of this among our father of old
Al-Qasas,30,0.703,0.081,0.711,0.208,musa said my lord know best him who came with guidance from him and whose will be the happy end in the hereafter verily the wrongdoer will not be successful
Al-Qasas,49,-0.3612,0.104,0.82,0.077,fir awn said chief know not that you have god other than me so kindle for me fire haman to bake clay and set up for me sarh in order that may look at the god of musa and verily think that he musa is one of the liar
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.138,0.862,0.0,and he and his army were arrogant in the land without right and they thought that they would never return to u
Al-Qasas,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we seized him and his army and we threw them all into the sea so behold what wa the end of the wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,20,-0.0258,0.106,0.793,0.101,and we made them leader inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
Al-Qasas,21,-0.7579,0.255,0.745,0.0,and we made curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be among disgraced
Al-Qasas,28,-0.1779,0.104,0.814,0.081,and indeed we gave musa after we had destroyed the generation of old the scripture a an enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy that they might remember
Al-Qasas,26,0.3818,0.0,0.906,0.094,and you were not on the western side of the mount when we made clear to musa the commandment and you were not among the witness
Al-Qasas,36,0.2885,0.035,0.899,0.066,but we created generation and long were the age that passed over them and you were not dweller among the people of madyan reciting our ayat to them but it is we who kept sending messenger
Al-Qasas,44,-0.3919,0.12,0.814,0.066,and you were not at the side of at tur when we called but you are sent a mercy from your lord to give warning to people to whom no warner had come before you in order that they may remember or receive admonition
Al-Qasas,52,0.4939,0.0,0.94,0.06,and if we had not sent you to the people of makkah in case calamity should seize them for what their hand have sent forth they would have said our lord why did you not send u messenger we would then have followed your ayat and would have been among the believer
Al-Qasas,57,0.8185,0.041,0.786,0.172,but when the truth ha come to them from u they say why is he not given the like of what wa given to musa did they not disbelieve in that which wa given to musa of old they say two kind of magic each helping the other and they say verily in both we are disbeliever
Al-Qasas,21,0.7096,0.0,0.763,0.237,say then bring book from allah which is better guide than these two that may follow it if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,40,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but if they answer you not then know that they only follow their own lust and who is more astray than one who follows his own lust without guidance from allah verily allah guide not the people who are wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed now we have conveyed the word to them in order that they may remember
Al-Qasas,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the scripture before it they believe in it
Al-Qasas,30,0.3182,0.0,0.927,0.073,and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it verily it is the truth from our lord indeed even before it we have been from muslim
Al-Qasas,27,0.296,0.126,0.686,0.189,these will be given their reward twice over because they are patient and repel evil with good and spend out of what we have provided for them
Al-Qasas,34,-0.7003,0.222,0.694,0.084,and when they hear evil vain talk they withdraw from it and say to u our deed and to you your deed peace be to you we seek not the way of the ignorant
Al-Qasas,22,0.7387,0.057,0.731,0.212,verily you guide not whom you like but allah guide whom he will and he know best those who are the guided

Al-Ahqaaf,43,0.1027,0.069,0.833,0.098,say tell me if it wa from allah and you disbelieved it at the same time witness from among the child of israel ha testified to something similar and believed while you rejected the truth verily allah doe not guide the wrongdoing people
Al-Ahqaaf,40,-0.34,0.12,0.814,0.066,and those who disbelieve say of those who believe had it been good thing they the poor believer would not have preceded u to it and when they have not been guided by it they say this is ancient falsehood
Al-Ahqaaf,36,0.5994,0.107,0.692,0.2,and before this wa the scripture of musa a guide and mercy and this is book confirming in the arabic tongue to warn those who do wrong and a glad tidings for the doer of good
Al-Ahqaaf,23,-0.4966,0.196,0.725,0.079,verily those who say our lord is only allah and thereafter stand firm on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve

Al-Ahqaaf,54,0.8573,0.056,0.744,0.2,but he who say to his parent uff to you do you promise me that will be raised up when generation before me have passed while they invoke allah for help woe to you believe verily the promise of allah is true but he say this is nothing but the legend of the ancient
Al-Ahqaaf,29,0.1779,0.099,0.754,0.148,they are those against whom the word of torment ha justified among the previous generation of jinni and mankind that have passed away verily they are ever the loser
Al-Ahqaaf,28,0.3412,0.0,0.918,0.082,and for all there will be degree according to that which they did so that he might fully recompense for their deed and they will not be wronged
Al-Ahqaaf,63,-0.7003,0.189,0.724,0.087,on the day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the fire it will be said you received your good thing in the life of the world and you took your pleasure therein today you will be recompensed with the torment of extreme humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you used to rebel against allah command
Al-Ahqaaf,40,-0.7513,0.189,0.737,0.075,and remember the brother of ad when he warned his people in al ahqaf and surely warner had already passed on before him and after him saying worship none but allah truly fear for you the torment of mighty day
Al-Ahqaaf,27,0.3612,0.091,0.732,0.178,they said have you come to delude u from our god then bring u that with which you threaten u if you are one of the truthful
Al-Ahqaaf,28,-0.5023,0.107,0.893,0.0,he said the knowledge of that is only with allah and convey to you that wherewith have been sent but see that you are people given to ignorance
Al-Ahqaaf,36,-0.5927,0.104,0.896,0.0,then when they saw it a dense cloud approaching their valley they said this is cloud bringing u rain nay but it is that which you were asking to be hastened wind wherein is painful torment
Al-Ahqaaf,27,-0.7845,0.218,0.748,0.034,destroying everything by the command of it lord so they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwelling thus do we recompense the criminal people
Al-Ahqaaf,53,-0.6249,0.118,0.815,0.067,and indeed we had firmly established them with that wherewith we have not established you we also gave them hearing vision and heart but their hearing vision and heart availed them nothing since they used to deny the ayat of allah and they were completely encircled by that which they used to ridicule
Al-Ahqaaf,24,-0.4939,0.122,0.878,0.0,and indeed we have destroyed town round about you and we have shown them the sign in various way so that they might return
Al-Ahqaaf,42,0.1406,0.0,0.962,0.038,a for those whom they had taken for god besides allah a the mean of approach to him why then did they not aid them nay but they vanished completely from them and that wa their falsehood and what they were fabricating
Al-Ahqaaf,37,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and remember when we sent toward you group of the jinni to listen to the qur an when they attended it they said listen quietly and when it wa concluded they returned to their people a warner
Al-Ahqaaf,28,0.4939,0.0,0.861,0.139,they said our people verily we have heard book sent down after musa confirming what came before it it guide to the truth and to the straight path
Al-Ahqaaf,25,-0.4215,0.202,0.652,0.146,our people respond to allah caller and believe in him he allah will forgive you some of your sin and protect you from painful torment
Al-Ahqaaf,27,-0.497,0.144,0.856,0.0,and whosoever doe not respond to allah caller he cannot escape on earth and he will not have besides allah any protector those are in manifest error
Al-Ahqaaf,37,0.7717,0.089,0.642,0.269,do they not see that allah who created the heaven and the earth and wa not wearied by their creation is able to give life to the dead yes he surely is able to do all thing
Al-Ahqaaf,44,-0.6555,0.198,0.749,0.053,and on the day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the fire it will be said to them is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will say then taste the torment because you used to disbelieve
Al-Ahqaaf,60,-0.6486,0.132,0.787,0.082,therefore be patient a did those of determination among the messenger and be in no hurry for them on the day when they will see what they are promised it will be a though they had not remained in the world except an hour in day this is clear message but will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people
Muhammad,17,-0.6124,0.25,0.75,0.0,those who disbelieve and hinder men from the path of allah he will render their deed vain
Muhammad,37,0.2263,0.107,0.744,0.149,but those who believe and do righteous good deed and believe in that which is sent down to muhammad for it is the truth from their lord he expiates from them their sin and amends their bal
Muhammad,27,0.0258,0.075,0.847,0.078,that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood while those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus doe allah set forth for mankind their parable
Muhammad,81,-0.9584,0.232,0.745,0.023,so when you meet those who disbelieve in battle smite their neck until you have fully defeated them then tighten their bond thereafter is the time either for generosity or ransom until the war lay down it burden thus and had allah so willed he could have taken vengeance against them but he let you struggle so a to test with one another but those who are killed in the way of allah he will never let their deed be lost
Muhammad,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he will guide them and amend their condition
Muhammad,12,0.8126,0.0,0.517,0.483,and admit them to paradise which he ha made known to them
Muhammad,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,you who believe if you support in the cause of allah he will support you and make your foothold firm
Muhammad,16,-0.9022,0.481,0.458,0.06,but a for those who disbelieve misery awaits them and allah will make their deed vain
Muhammad,18,0.0258,0.157,0.638,0.204,that is because they hate that which allah ha sent down so he ha made their deed fruitless
Muhammad,27,-0.3892,0.108,0.84,0.053,have they not traveled through the earth and seen what happened in the end to those before them allah destroyed them completely and similar awaits the disbeliever
Muhammad,17,-0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,that is because allah is the protector of those who believe whereas the disbeliever have no protector
