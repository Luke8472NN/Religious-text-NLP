Al-Baqarah,20,-0.8074,0.328,0.672,0.0,and when you killed soul and accused one another about it and allah wa to expose what you were concealing
Al-Baqarah,27,-0.5267,0.18,0.745,0.075,we said strike him with piece of it thus doe allah revive the dead and he show you his sign so that you may exercise your reason
Al-Baqarah,57,-0.1119,0.052,0.902,0.045,then your heart hardened after that so they are like stone or even harder for there are some stone from which stream gush forth and there are some of them that split and water issue from them and there are some that fall for the fear of allah and allah is not oblivious of what you do
Al-Baqarah,37,0.0516,0.058,0.879,0.063,are you then eager that they should believe you though part of them would hear the word of allah and then they would distort it after they had understood it and they knew what they were doing
Al-Baqarah,47,0.2263,0.083,0.816,0.101,when they meet the faithful they say we believe and when they are alone with one another they say do you recount to them what allah ha revealed to you so that they may argue with you therewith before your lord do you not exercise your reason
Al-Baqarah,14,-0.1779,0.116,0.884,0.0,do they not know that allah know whatever they hide and whatever they disclose

Al-Baqarah,44,0.1333,0.163,0.666,0.172,so woe to them who write the book with their hand and then say this is from allah that they may sell it for paltry gain so woe to them for what their hand have written and woe to them for what they earn
Al-Baqarah,39,0.3612,0.057,0.804,0.139,and they say the fire shall not touch u except for number of day say have you taken promise from allah if so allah will never break his promise do you ascribe to allah what you do not know
Al-Baqarah,25,0.0258,0.086,0.789,0.125,certainly whoever commits misdeed and is besieged by his iniquity such shall be the inmate of the fire and they will remain in it forever
Al-Baqarah,22,0.7906,0.0,0.741,0.259,and those who have faith and do righteous deed they shall be the inhabitant of paradise they will remain in it forever
Al-Baqarah,47,0.7227,0.083,0.744,0.173,when we took pledge from the child of israel saying worship no one but allah do good to your parent relative orphan and the needy speak kindly to people maintain the prayer and give the zakat you turned away except few of you and you were disregardful
Al-Baqarah,37,0.3412,0.0,0.937,0.063,and when we took pledge from you saying you shall not shed your own people blood and you shall not expel your folk from your home you pledged and you testify to this pledge of your ancestor
Al-Baqarah,100,-0.9771,0.23,0.761,0.009,then there you were killing your folk and expelling part of your folk from their home backing one another against them in sin and aggression and if they came to you a captive you would ransom them though their expulsion itself wa forbidden you what do you believe in part of the book and deny another part so what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be consigned to the severest punishment and allah is not oblivious of what you do
Al-Baqarah,26,-0.539,0.122,0.878,0.0,they are the one who bought the life of this world for the hereafter so their punishment shall not be lightened nor will they be helped
Al-Baqarah,60,-0.2401,0.078,0.859,0.063,certainly we gave moses the book and followed him with the apostle and we gave jesus the son of mary manifest proof and confirmed him with the holy spirit is it not that whenever an apostle brought you that which wa not to your liking you would act arrogantly so you would impugn group of them and slay nother group
Al-Baqarah,21,0.6369,0.0,0.785,0.215,and they say our heart are uncircumcised rather allah ha cursed them for their unfaith so few of them have faith
Al-Baqarah,47,-0.7479,0.161,0.797,0.043,and when there came to them book from allah confirming that which is with them and earlier they would pray for victory over the pagan so when there came to them what they recognized they denied it so may the curse of allah be on the faithless
Al-Baqarah,48,-0.7184,0.225,0.647,0.128,evil is that for which they have sold their soul by defying what allah ha sent down out of envy that allah should bestow his grace on any of his servant that he wish thus they earned wrath upon wrath and there is humiliating punishment for the faithless
Al-Baqarah,55,-0.0772,0.109,0.772,0.12,and when they are told believe in what allah ha sent down they say we believe in what wa sent down to u and they disbelieve what is besides it though it is the truth confirming what is with them say then why would you kill the prophet of allah formerly should you be faithful
Al-Baqarah,20,0.1779,0.0,0.918,0.082,certainly moses brought you manifest proof but then you took up the calf in his absence and you were wrongdoer
Al-Baqarah,63,0.6705,0.06,0.805,0.135,and when we took covenant with you and raised the mount above you declaring hold on with power to what we have given you and do listen they said we hear and disobey and their heart had been imbued with the love of the calf due to their unfaith say evil is that to which your faith prompt you should you be faithful
Al-Baqarah,26,-0.2263,0.126,0.777,0.097,say if the abode of the hereafter were exclusively for you with allah and not for other people then long for death should you be truthful

Al-Baqarah,16,-0.3818,0.245,0.637,0.118,we have certainly sent down manifest sign to you and no one denies them except transgressor
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.3252,0.092,0.908,0.0,is it not that whenever they made covenant part of them would cast it away rather the majority of them do not have faith
Al-Baqarah,43,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when there came to them an apostle from allah confirming that which is with them part of those who were given the book cast the book of allah behind their back a if they did not know that it is allah book
Al-Baqarah,130,0.7343,0.131,0.688,0.181,and they followed what the devil pursued during solomon reign and solomon wa not faithless but it wa the devil who were faithless teaching the people magic and what wa sent down to the two angel at babylon harut and marut who would not teach anyone without telling him we are only test so do not be faithless but they would learn from those two that with which they would cause split between man and his wife though they could not harm anyone with it except with allah leave they would learn that which would harm them and bring them no benefit though they certainly knew that anyone who buy it ha no share in the hereafter surely evil is that for which they sold their soul had they known
Al-Baqarah,17,0.8591,0.0,0.596,0.404,had they been faithful and godwary the reward from allah would have been better had they known
Al-Baqarah,22,-0.8674,0.349,0.589,0.062,you who have faith do not say ra ina but say unzurna and listen and there is painful punishment for the faithless
Al-Baqarah,41,0.9055,0.031,0.695,0.274,neither the faithless from among the people of the book nor the idolater like that any good be showered on you from your lord but allah single out for his mercy whomever he wish and allah is dispenser of mighty grace
Al-Baqarah,34,0.5267,0.05,0.812,0.139,for any verse that we abrogate or cause to be forgotten we bring another which is better than it or similar to it do you not know that allah ha power over all thing
Al-Baqarah,27,0.6908,0.0,0.814,0.186,do you not know that to allah belongs the kingdom of the heaven and the earth and besides allah you do not have any guardian or helper
Al-Baqarah,21,0.5859,0.059,0.72,0.22,would you question your apostle a moses wa questioned formerly whoever change faith for unfaith certainly stray from the right way
Al-Baqarah,48,0.802,0.038,0.758,0.204,many of the people of the book are eager to turn you into unbeliever after your faith out of their inner envy and after the truth had become manifest to them yet excuse them and forbear until allah issue his edict indeed allah ha power over all thing
Al-Baqarah,30,0.4404,0.0,0.909,0.091,and maintain the prayer and give the zakat any good that you send ahead for your own soul you shall find it with allah indeed allah watch what you do
Al-Baqarah,28,0.836,0.061,0.661,0.278,and they say no one will enter paradise except one who is jew or christian those are their false hope say produce your evidence should you be truthful
Al-Baqarah,28,0.7418,0.138,0.563,0.299,certainly whoever submits his will to allah and is virtuous he shall have his reward from his lord and they will have no fear nor shall they grieve
Al-Baqarah,54,-0.296,0.04,0.96,0.0,the jew say the christian stand on nothing and the christian say the jew stand on nothing though they follow the same book so said those who had no knowledge word similar to what they say allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that about which they used to differ
Al-Baqarah,48,-0.6705,0.239,0.605,0.156,who is greater wrongdoer than those who deny access to the mosque of allah lest his name be celebrated therein and try to ruin them such one may not enter them except in fear there is disgrace for them in this world and great punishment in the hereafter
Al-Baqarah,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to allah belong the east and the west so whichever way you turn there is the face of allah allah is indeed all bounteous all knowing

Al-Baqarah,54,0.5719,0.031,0.875,0.094,and remember when we made the house place of reward for mankind and sanctuary declaring take the venue of prayer from abraham station we charged abraham and ishmael with it upkeep saying purify my house for those who go around it for those who make it retreat and for those who bow and prostrate
Al-Baqarah,60,-0.7543,0.173,0.748,0.08,and when abraham said my lord make this secure town and provide it people with fruit such of them a have faith in allah and the last day he said a for him who is faithless will provide for him too for short time then will shove him toward the punishment of the fire and it is an evil destination
Al-Baqarah,27,0.3818,0.0,0.902,0.098,a abraham raised the foundation of the house with ishmael they prayed our lord accept it from u indeed you are the all hearing the all knowing

Al-Araf,67,0.926,0.0,0.797,0.203,indeed your lord is allah who created the heaven and the earth in six day and then settled on the throne he draw the night cover over the day which pursues it swiftly and he created the sun the moon and the star all of them disposed by his command look all creation and command belong to him blessed is allah the lord of all the world

Al-Araf,26,0.6808,0.094,0.647,0.259,and do not cause corruption on the earth after it restoration and supplicate him with fear and hope indeed allah mercy is close to the virtuous
Al-Araf,52,-0.7964,0.146,0.812,0.042,it is he who sends forth the wind a harbinger of his mercy when they bear rain laden cloud we drive them toward dead land and send down water on it and with it we bring forth all kind of crop thus shall we raise the dead maybe you will take admonition
Al-Araf,39,0.3182,0.079,0.79,0.131,the good land it vegetation come out by the permission of it lord and a for that which is bad it doe not come out except sparsely thus do we paraphrase the sign variously for people who give thanks

Al-Araf,30,-0.9559,0.39,0.61,0.0,but they denied him so we delivered him and those who were with him in the ark and we drowned those who denied our sign indeed they were blind lot
Al-Araf,32,0.2732,0.062,0.817,0.121,and to the people of ad we sent hud their brother he said my people worship allah you have no other god besides him will you not then be wary of him
Al-Araf,25,-0.6486,0.187,0.813,0.0,the elite of his people who were faithless said indeed we see you to be in folly and indeed we consider you to be liar

Al-Araf,34,-0.0772,0.189,0.63,0.181,they said have you come to tell u that we should worship allah alone and abandon what our father have been worshiping then bring u what you threaten u with should you be truthful
Al-Araf,45,-0.2023,0.113,0.769,0.117,he said punishment and wrath from your lord ha become due against you do you dispute with me regarding name which you have named you and your father for which allah ha not sent down any authority so wait too am waiting along with you
Al-Araf,27,-0.4226,0.172,0.747,0.081,then we delivered him and those who were with him by mercy from u and we rooted out those who denied our sign and were not faithful
Al-Araf,69,-0.4215,0.163,0.696,0.142,and to the people of thamud we sent salih their brother he said my people worship allah you have no other god besides him there ha certainly come to you manifest proof from your lord this she camel of allah is sign for you let her alone to graze freely in allah land and do not cause her any harm for then you shall be seized by painful punishment
Al-Araf,44,0.5352,0.0,0.904,0.096,remember when he made you successor after the people of ad and settled you in the land you build palace in it plain and hew house out of the mountain so remember allah bounty and do not act wickedly on the earth causing corruption

Al-Araf,31,-0.3818,0.085,0.915,0.0,so they hamstrung the she camel and defied the command of their lord and they said salih bring u what you threaten u with if you are one of the apostle
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereupon the earthquake seized them and they lay lifeless prostrate in their home
Al-Araf,32,0.0247,0.127,0.716,0.156,so he abandoned them to their fate and said my people certainly communicated to you the message of my lord and wa your well wisher but you did not like well wishers
Al-Araf,22,0.0,0.124,0.714,0.162,and lot when he said to his people what do you commit an outrage none in the world ever committed before you
Al-Araf,15,0.4019,0.0,0.838,0.162,indeed you come to men with desire instead of woman indeed you are profligate lot
Al-Araf,21,-0.5927,0.161,0.839,0.0,but the only answer of his people wa that they said expel them from your town they are indeed puritanical lot
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereupon we delivered him and his family except his wife she wa one of those who remained behind
Al-Araf,18,-0.4215,0.141,0.859,0.0,then we poured down upon them rain of stone so observe how wa the fate of the guilty

Al-Araf,49,0.0516,0.05,0.897,0.053,and do not lie in wait on every road to threaten and bar those who have faith in him from the way of allah seeking to make it crooked remember when you were few and he multiplied you and observe how wa the fate of the agent of corruption
Al-Araf,31,0.6369,0.0,0.873,0.127,if group of you have believed in what have been sent with and group have not believed be patient until allah judge between u and he is the best of judge
Al-Araf,43,-0.0772,0.12,0.766,0.114,the elite of his people who were arrogant said shu ayb we will surely expel you and the faithful who are with you from our town or else you shall revert to our creed he said what even if we should be unwilling
Al-Araf,67,0.9147,0.0,0.825,0.175,we would be fabricating lie against allah should we revert to your creed after allah had delivered u from it it doe not behoove u to return to it unless allah our lord should wish so our lord embrace all thing in his knowledge in allah we have put our trust our lord judge justly between u and our people and you are the best of judge
Al-Araf,19,-0.6597,0.241,0.759,0.0,the elite of his people who were faithless said if you follow shu ayb you will indeed be loser
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and they lay lifeless prostrate in their home
Al-Araf,22,-0.5267,0.145,0.855,0.0,those who impugned shu ayb became a if they had never lived there those who impugned shu ayb were themselves the loser
Al-Araf,32,-0.5635,0.205,0.681,0.114,so he abandoned them to their fate and said my people certainly communicated to you the message of my lord and wa your well wisher so how should grieve for faithless lot
Al-Araf,24,-0.6249,0.212,0.717,0.072,we did not send prophet to any town without visiting it people with stress and distress so that they might entreat for allah forgiveness
Al-Araf,31,-0.1779,0.189,0.639,0.171,then we changed the ill condition to good until they multiplied in number and said adversity and ease befell our father too then we seized them suddenly while they were unaware
Al-Araf,38,0.09,0.087,0.772,0.141,if the people of the town had been faithful and godwary we would have opened to them blessing from the heaven and the earth but they denied so we seized them because of what they used to earn
Al-Araf,19,-0.2023,0.142,0.752,0.106,do the people of the town feel secure from our punishment overtaking them at night while they are asleep
Al-Araf,20,-0.0,0.131,0.697,0.172,do the people of the town feel secure from our punishment overtaking them at midday while they are playing around
Al-Araf,20,-0.2023,0.212,0.606,0.182,do they feel secure from allah devising no one feel secure from allah devising except the people who are loser
Al-Araf,36,-0.6486,0.164,0.773,0.063,doe it not dawn upon those who inherited the earth after it former inhabitant that if we wish we will punish them for their sin and set seal on their heart so they would not hear
Al-Araf,44,-0.6858,0.129,0.836,0.035,these are the town some of whose account we recount to you their apostle certainly brought them manifest proof but they were not the one to believe in what they had denied earlier thus doe allah put seal on the heart of the faithless
Al-Araf,21,0.5423,0.0,0.851,0.149,we did not find in most of them any loyalty to covenant indeed we found most of them to be transgressor
Al-Araf,29,-0.5927,0.121,0.879,0.0,then after them we sent moses with our sign to pharaoh and his elite but they wronged them so observe how wa the fate of the agent of corruption
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and moses said pharaoh am indeed an apostle from the lord of all the world
Al-Araf,28,0.5719,0.0,0.847,0.153,it behooves me to say nothing about allah except the truth certainly bring you manifest proof from your lord so let the child of israel go with me
Al-Araf,13,0.4588,0.0,0.8,0.2,he said if you have brought sign produce it should you be truthful
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereat he threw down his staff and behold it became manifest python
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,then he drew out his hand and behold it wa white to the onlooker
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the elite of pharaoh people said this is indeed an expert magician
Al-Araf,13,-0.4404,0.195,0.805,0.0,he seek to expel you from your land so what do you advise
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said put him and his brother off for while and send herald to the city
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to bring you every expert magician
Al-Araf,20,0.5719,0.0,0.837,0.163,and the magician came to pharaoh they said we shall indeed have reward if we were to be the victor
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said of course and indeed you shall be among those near to me
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses will you throw first or shall we throw
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said throw yours so when they threw they bewitched the people eye and overawed them producing tremendous magic
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we signalled to moses throw down your staff and behold it wa swallowing what they had faked
Al-Araf,14,0.3774,0.0,0.834,0.166,so the truth came out and what they had wrought wa reduced to naught
Al-Araf,8,-0.34,0.255,0.745,0.0,thereat they were vanquished and they retreated humiliated
Al-Araf,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician fell down in prostration
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we have believed in the lord of all the world
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,34,-0.0258,0.077,0.849,0.074,pharaoh said do you profess faith in him before may permit you it is indeed plot you have devised in the city to expel it people from it soon you will know the consequence
Al-Araf,19,0.7845,0.08,0.575,0.345,surely will cut off your hand and foot on opposite side and then will surely crucify all of you
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said indeed we shall return to our lord
Al-Araf,34,-0.34,0.117,0.808,0.075,you are vindictive toward u only because we have believed in the sign of our lord when they came to u our lord pour patience upon u and grant u to die a muslim
Al-Araf,44,-0.7717,0.173,0.786,0.041,the elite of pharaoh people said will you leave moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and to abandon you and your god he said we will kill their son and spare their woman and indeed we are dominant over them
Al-Araf,41,0.8074,0.0,0.821,0.179,moses said to his people turn to allah for help and be patient the earth indeed belongs to allah and he give it inheritance to whomever he wish of his servant and the outcome will be in favour of the godwary
Al-Araf,41,-0.7269,0.156,0.802,0.042,they said we were tormented before you came to u and also after you came to u he said maybe your lord will destroy your enemy and make you successor in the land and then he will see how you act
Al-Araf,17,-0.34,0.226,0.66,0.113,certainly we afflicted pharaoh clan with drought and loss of produce so that they may take admonition
Al-Araf,52,-0.8047,0.176,0.763,0.061,but whenever any good came to them they would say this is our due and if any ill visited them they took it for ill omen attending moses and those who were with him look indeed the cause of their ill omen is from allah but most of them do not know
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they said whatever sign you may bring u to bewitch u we are not going to believe you
Al-Araf,24,-0.8481,0.315,0.685,0.0,so we sent against them flood and locust louse frog and blood a distinct sign but they acted arrogantly and they were guilty lot
Al-Araf,45,0.5859,0.0,0.895,0.105,whenever plague fell upon them they would say moses invoke your lord for u by the covenant he ha made with you if you remove the plague from u we will certainly believe in you and let the child of israel go along with you
Al-Araf,21,-0.1901,0.144,0.741,0.115,but when we had removed the plague from them until term that they should have completed behold they broke their promise
Al-Araf,22,-0.7783,0.254,0.746,0.0,so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for they denied our sign and were oblivious to them
Al-Araf,55,0.875,0.048,0.753,0.199,we made the people who were abased the heir to the east and west of the land which we had blessed and your lord best word of promise wa fulfilled for the child of israel because of their patience and we destroyed what pharaoh and his people had built and what they used to erect
Al-Araf,42,0.6908,0.045,0.768,0.188,we carried the child of israel across the sea whereat they came upon people cleaving to certain idol that they had they said moses make for u god like the god that they have he said you are indeed an ignorant lot
Al-Araf,20,0.4019,0.0,0.876,0.124,what they are engaged in is indeed bound to perish and what they have been doing shall come to naught
Al-Araf,18,0.6597,0.0,0.701,0.299,he said shall find you god other than allah while he ha graced you over all the nation
Al-Araf,31,0.25,0.086,0.801,0.113,and when we delivered you from pharaoh clan who inflicted on you terrible torment slaughtering your son and sparing your woman and there wa great test in that from your lord
Al-Araf,54,0.2263,0.0,0.965,0.035,we made an appointment with moses for thirty night and completed them with ten more thus the tryst of his lord wa completed in forty night and moses said to aaron his brother be my successor among my people and set thing right and do not follow the way of the agent of corruption
Al-Araf,85,0.5927,0.0,0.956,0.044,when moses arrived at our tryst and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show yourself to me that may look at you he said you shall not see me but look at the mountain if it abides in it place then you will see me so when his lord disclosed himself to the mountain he levelled it and moses fell down swooning when he recovered he said immaculate are you turn to you in penitence and am the first of the faithful
Al-Araf,25,0.4588,0.0,0.889,0.111,he said moses have chosen you over the people with my message and my speech so take what give you and be among the grateful
Al-Araf,50,0.6369,0.0,0.921,0.079,we wrote for him in the tablet advice concerning all thing and an elaboration of all thing and we said hold on to them with power and bid your people to hold on to the best of what is in them soon shall show you the abode of the transgressor
Al-Araf,71,-0.8074,0.112,0.888,0.0,soon shall turn away from my sign those who are unduly arrogant in the earth even though they should see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of rectitude they will not take it a their way and if they see the way of error they will take it a their way that is because they deny our sign and are oblivious to them
Al-Araf,26,-0.6908,0.192,0.808,0.0,those who deny our sign and the encounter of the hereafter their work have failed shall they not be requited for what they used to do
Al-Araf,49,0.1779,0.03,0.927,0.043,the people of moses took up in his absence calf cast from their ornament body that gave out lowing sound did they not regard that it did not speak to them nor did it guide them to any way they took it up for worship and they were wrongdoer
Al-Araf,31,0.0,0.229,0.541,0.229,but when they became remorseful and realised they had gone astray they said should our lord have no mercy on u and forgive u we will be surely among the loser
Al-Araf,83,-0.9306,0.182,0.765,0.053,when moses returned to his people angry and indignant he said evil ha been your conduct in my absence would you hasten on the edict of your lord he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the head pulling him towards himself he said son of my mother indeed this people thought me to be weak and they were about to kill me so do not let the enemy gloat over me and do not take me with the wrongdoing lot
Al-Araf,24,0.6597,0.0,0.758,0.242,he said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
Al-Araf,32,0.296,0.0,0.934,0.066,indeed those who took up the calf for worship shall be overtaken by their lord wrath and abasement in the life of the world thus do we requite the fabricator of lie
Al-Araf,24,0.8519,0.0,0.693,0.307,yet to those who commit misdeed but repent after that and believe indeed after that your lord shall surely be all forgiving all merciful
Al-Araf,24,-0.2263,0.122,0.789,0.09,when moses indignation abated he picked up the tablet whose inscription contained guidance and mercy for those who are in awe of their lord
Al-Araf,83,0.7895,0.099,0.72,0.181,moses chose seventy men from his people for our tryst and when the earthquake seized them he said my lord had you wished you would have destroyed them and me before will you destroy u because of what the fool amongst u have done it is only your test by which you lead astray whomever you wish and guide whomever you wish you are our master so forgive u and have mercy on u for you are the best of those who forgive
Al-Araf,53,0.7876,0.036,0.795,0.17,and appoint goodness for u in this world and the hereafter for indeed we have come back to you said he visit my punishment on whomever wish but my mercy embrace all thing soon shall appoint it for those who are godwary and give the zakat and those who believe in our sign
Al-Araf,89,0.4019,0.123,0.739,0.138,those who follow the apostle the untaught prophet whose mention they find written with them in the torah and the evangel who bid them to do what is right and forbids them from what is wrong make lawful to them all the good thing and forbids them from all vicious thing and relief them of their burden and the shackle that were upon them those who believe in him honour him and help him and follow the light that ha been sent down with him they are the felicitous
Al-Araf,63,0.7818,0.08,0.736,0.184,say mankind am the apostle of allah to you all of him to whom belongs the kingdom of the heaven and the earth there is no god except him he give life and brings death so have faith in allah and his apostle the untaught prophet who ha faith in allah and his word and follow him so that you may be guided
Al-Araf,18,0.6908,0.0,0.737,0.263,among the people of moses is nation who guide the people by the truth and do justice thereby
Al-Araf,79,0.7011,0.015,0.899,0.086,we split them up into twelve tribal community and we revealed to moses when his people asked him for water saying strike the rock with your staff whereat twelve fountain gushed forth from it every tribe came to know it drinking place and we shaded them with cloud and we sent down to them manna and quail eat of the good thing we have provided you and they did not wrong u but they used to wrong only themselves
Al-Araf,44,0.4939,0.12,0.683,0.197,and when they were told settle in this town and eat thereof whence you wish and say relieve u of the burden of our sin and enter prostrating at the gate that we may forgive your iniquity and soon we shall enhance the virtuous
Al-Araf,31,-0.3291,0.115,0.807,0.078,but the wrongdoer changed the saying with other than what they had been told so we sent against them plague from the sky because of the wrong they used to commit
Al-Araf,59,0.1531,0.035,0.919,0.045,ask them about the town that wa situated on the seaside when they violated the sabbath when their fish would come to them on the sabbath day visibly on the shore but on day when they were not keeping sabbath they would not come to them thus did we test them because of the transgression they used to commit
Al-Araf,36,-0.8591,0.277,0.632,0.092,when group of them said why do you advise people whom allah will destroy or punish with severe punishment they said a an excuse before your lord and with the hope that they may be godwary
Al-Araf,32,-0.8591,0.262,0.685,0.054,so when they forgot what they had been reminded of we delivered those who forbade evil conduct and seized the wrongdoer with terrible punishment because of the transgression they used to commit
Al-Araf,20,-0.4215,0.128,0.872,0.0,when they defied the command pertaining to what they were forbidden from we said to them be you spurned ape

Yusuf,25,-0.7264,0.209,0.791,0.0,he said it really upset me that you should take him away and fear the wolf may eat him while you are oblivious of him
Yusuf,18,-0.1779,0.154,0.724,0.122,they said should the wolf eat him while we are hardy band then we will indeed be loser
Yusuf,42,0.6124,0.0,0.889,0.111,so when they took him away and conspired to put him into the recess of well we revealed to him day will come when you will surely inform them about this affair of theirs while they are not aware of your identity
Yusuf,9,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,in the evening they came weeping to their father
Yusuf,29,0.5927,0.0,0.875,0.125,they said father we had gone racing and left joseph with our thing whereat the wolf ate him but you will not believe u even if we spoke truly
Yusuf,33,0.2263,0.061,0.826,0.113,and they produced sham blood on his shirt he said no your soul have made matter seem decorous to you yet patience is graceful and allah is my resort against what you allege
Yusuf,38,0.7522,0.039,0.795,0.166,there came caravan and they sent their water drawer who let down his bucket good news he said this is young boy so they hid him a piece of merchandise and allah knew best what they were doing
Yusuf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they sold him for cheap price few dirham for they set small store by him
Yusuf,64,0.6757,0.0,0.87,0.13,the man from egypt who had bought him said to his wife give him an honourable place in the household maybe he will be useful to u or we may adopt him a son thus we established joseph in the land and that we might teach him the interpretation of dream allah ha full command of his affair but most people do not know
Yusuf,19,0.7964,0.0,0.705,0.295,when he came of age we gave him judgement and sacred knowledge and thus do we reward the virtuous
Yusuf,37,0.6249,0.054,0.773,0.173,the woman in whose house he wa solicited him she closed the door and said come he said god forbid indeed he is my lord he ha given me good abode indeed the wrongdoer are not felicitous
Yusuf,44,0.0,0.087,0.807,0.106,she certainly made for him and he would have made for her too had he not beheld the proof of his lord so it wa that we might turn away from him all evil and indecency he wa indeed one of our dedicated servant
Yusuf,43,-0.8442,0.202,0.751,0.046,they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind and they ran into her husband at the door she said what is to be the requital of him who ha evil intention for your wife except imprisonment or painful punishment
Yusuf,30,0.0772,0.062,0.867,0.071,he said it wa she who solicited me witness of her own household testified thus if his shirt is torn from the front she tell the truth and he lie
Yusuf,16,0.1154,0.129,0.72,0.152,but if his shirt is torn from behind then she lie and he tell the truth
Yusuf,25,0.4767,0.069,0.79,0.141,so when he saw that his shirt wa torn from behind he said this is case of you woman guile your guile is indeed great
Yusuf,20,-0.5228,0.226,0.645,0.13,joseph let this matter alone and you woman plead for forgiveness for your sin for you have indeed been erring
Yusuf,27,0.836,0.074,0.606,0.32,some of the townswomen said the chieftain wife ha solicited her slave boy he ha captivated her love indeed we see her to be in manifest error
Yusuf,57,0.8248,0.024,0.816,0.16,when she heard of their machination she sent for them and arranged repast and gave each of them knife and said to joseph come out before them so when they saw him they marvelled at him and cut their hand absent mindedly and they said good heaven this is not human being this is but noble angel
Yusuf,36,-0.128,0.139,0.734,0.127,she said he is the one on whose account you blamed me certainly did solicit him but he wa continent and if he doe not do what bid him surely he shall be imprisoned and humbled
Yusuf,36,0.0516,0.081,0.809,0.11,he said my lord the prison is dearer to me than to what they invite me if you do not turn away their scheme from me will incline towards them and become one of the senseless
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord answered him and turned away their stratagem from him indeed he is the all hearing the all knowing
Yusuf,23,0.3818,0.0,0.894,0.106,then it appeared to them after they had seen all the sign of his innocence that they should confine him for some time
Yusuf,51,0.0258,0.06,0.878,0.062,there entered the prison two youth along with him one of them said dreamt that am pressing grape the other said dreamt that am carrying bread on my head from which the bird are eating inform u of it interpretation they said for indeed we see you to be virtuous man
Yusuf,46,0.2023,0.085,0.814,0.101,he said before the meal you are served come to you will inform you of it interpretation that is among thing my lord ha taught me indeed renounce the creed of the people who have no faith in allah and who also disbelieve in the hereafter
Yusuf,41,-0.0795,0.072,0.839,0.089,follow the creed of my father abraham isaac and jacob it is not for u to ascribe any partner to allah that is by virtue of allah grace upon u and upon all mankind but most people do not give thanks
Yusuf,14,-0.1027,0.181,0.659,0.159,my prison mate are different master better or allah the one the all paramount
Yusuf,50,0.5959,0.067,0.798,0.136,you do not worship besides him but mere name that you and your father have coined for which allah ha not sent down any authority sovereignty belongs only to allah he ha commanded you to worship none except him that is the upright religion but most people do not know
Yusuf,40,-0.5859,0.144,0.776,0.08,my prison mate a for one of you he will serve wine to his master and a for the other he will be crucified and vulture will eat from his head the matter about which you inquire ha been decided
Yusuf,41,-0.7783,0.148,0.852,0.0,then he said to the one whom he knew would be delivered from among the two mention me to your master but satan caused him to forget mentioning it to his master so he remained in the prison for several year
Yusuf,40,0.6124,0.0,0.86,0.14,one day the king said saw in dream seven fat cow being devoured by seven lean one and seven green ear and seven others that were dry courtier give me your opinion about my dream if you can interpret dream
Yusuf,15,-0.3182,0.141,0.859,0.0,they said these are confused nightmare and we do not know the interpretation of nightmare
Yusuf,31,-0.5106,0.099,0.901,0.0,said the one of the two who had been delivered remembering joseph after long time will inform you of it interpretation so let me go to meet joseph in the prison
Yusuf,44,0.6597,0.0,0.862,0.138,joseph he said truthful one give u your opinion concerning seven fat cow who are eaten by seven lean one and seven green ear and seven others dry that may return to the people so that they may know the truth of the matter
Yusuf,23,-0.0516,0.052,0.948,0.0,he said you will sow for seven consecutive year then leave in the ear whatever grain you harvest except little that you eat
Yusuf,28,-0.1027,0.049,0.951,0.0,then after that there will come seven hard year which will eat up whatever you have set aside for them all except little which you preserve for seed
Yusuf,19,0.6249,0.0,0.769,0.231,then after that there will come year wherein the people will be granted relief and provided with rain therein
Yusuf,41,0.4939,0.046,0.837,0.117,the king said bring him to me when the messenger came to him he said go back to your master and ask him about the affair of woman who cut their hand my lord is indeed well aware of their stratagem
Yusuf,47,0.7096,0.11,0.666,0.225,the king said what wa your business woman when you solicited joseph they said heaven be praised we know of no evil in him the prince wife said now the truth ha come to light it wa who solicited him and he is indeed telling the truth
Yusuf,28,0.5216,0.0,0.889,0.111,joseph said initiated this inquiry that he may know that did not betray him in his absence and that allah doe not further the scheme of the treacherous
Yusuf,32,0.1311,0.157,0.649,0.195,yet do not absolve my own carnal soul for the carnal soul indeed prompt men to evil except inasmuch a my lord ha mercy indeed my lord is all forgiving all merciful
Yusuf,32,0.7783,0.0,0.81,0.19,the king said bring him to me will make him my favourite then when he had spoken with him he said indeed today onwards you will be honoured and trustworthy with u
Yusuf,16,0.2732,0.0,0.877,0.123,he said put me in charge of the country granary am indeed fastidious and well informed
Yusuf,36,0.7866,0.067,0.69,0.243,that is how we established joseph in the land that he may settle in it wherever he wished we confer our mercy on whomever we wish and we do not waste the reward of the virtuous
Yusuf,17,0.9062,0.0,0.514,0.486,and the reward of the hereafter is surely better for those who have faith and are godwary
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,after some year the brother of joseph came and entered his presence he recognized them but they did not recognize him
Yusuf,35,0.6369,0.0,0.89,0.11,when he had furnished them with their provision he said bring me brother that you have through your father do you not see that give the full measure and that am the best of host
Yusuf,25,-0.4215,0.104,0.896,0.0,but if you do not bring him to me then there will be no ration for you with me and don ever come near me
Yusuf,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,they said we will solicit him from his father that we will surely do
Yusuf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said to his servant put their money back into their saddlebag maybe they will recognize it when they return to their folk and maybe they will come back again
Yusuf,40,0.8176,0.0,0.805,0.195,so when they returned to their father they said father the measure ha been withheld from u so let our brother go with u so that we may obtain the measure and we will indeed take good care of him
Yusuf,32,0.6806,0.071,0.737,0.192,he said should not trust you with him just a trusted you with his brother before yet allah is the best of protector and he is the most merciful of merciful one
Yusuf,52,0.8207,0.0,0.831,0.169,and when they opened their baggage they found their money restored to them they said father what more do we want this is our money restored to u we will get provision for our family and take care of our brother and add another camel load of ration these are meagre ration
Yusuf,49,0.3182,0.05,0.893,0.056,he said will not let him go with you until you give me solemn pledge by allah that you will surely bring him back to me unless you are made to perish when they had given him their solemn pledge he said allah is witness over what we say
Yusuf,44,0.9253,0.0,0.767,0.233,and he said my son do not enter by one gate but enter by separate gate though cannot avail you anything against allah sovereignty belongs only to allah in him have put my trust and in him let all the trusting put their trust
Yusuf,41,0.8047,0.0,0.843,0.157,when they entered whence their father had bidden them it did not avail them anything against allah but only fulfilled wish in jacob heart indeed he had the knowledge of what we had taught him but most people do not know
Yusuf,31,0.466,0.0,0.908,0.092,when they entered into the presence of joseph he set his brother close to himself and said indeed am your brother so do not sorrow for what they used to do
Yusuf,28,-0.5267,0.112,0.888,0.0,when he had furnished them with their provision he put the drinking cup into his brother saddlebag then herald shouted men of the caravan you are indeed thief

Yusuf,22,0.1027,0.068,0.847,0.085,they said we miss the king goblet whoever brings it shall have camel load of grain said the steward will guarantee that
Yusuf,23,0.3561,0.097,0.717,0.186,they said by allah you certainly know that we did not come to make trouble in this country and we are not thief
Yusuf,13,-0.5267,0.221,0.779,0.0,they said what shall be it requital if you prove to be lying
Yusuf,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said the requital for it shall be that he in whose saddlebag it is found shall give himself over a it requital thus do we requite the wrongdoer
Yusuf,60,0.7579,0.0,0.899,0.101,then he began with their sack before opening his brother sack then he took it out from his brother sack thus did we devise for joseph sake he could not have held his brother under the king law unless allah willed otherwise we raise in rank whomever we please and above every man of knowledge is one who know best
Yusuf,45,-0.6124,0.204,0.662,0.134,they said if he ha stolen there is no wonder brother of his had stolen before thereupon joseph kept the matter to himself and he did not disclose it to them he said you are in worse state and allah know best what you allege

Yusuf,66,-0.0998,0.11,0.785,0.105,when they had despaired of moving him they withdrew to confer privately the eldest of them said don you know that your father ha taken solemn pledge from you by allah and earlier you have neglected your duty in regard to joseph so will never leave this land until my father permit me or allah pass judgement for me and he is the best of judge
Yusuf,30,0.5423,0.0,0.862,0.138,go back to your father and say father your son ha indeed committed theft and we testified only to what we knew and we could not have forestalled the unseen
Yusuf,21,0.3182,0.0,0.897,0.103,ask the people of the town we were in and the caravan with which we came we indeed speak the truth
Yusuf,34,0.6124,0.056,0.761,0.183,he said no your soul have made matter seem decorous to you yet patience is graceful maybe allah will bring them all back to me indeed he is the all knowing the all wise
Yusuf,23,-0.8442,0.313,0.687,0.0,he turned away from them and said ala for joseph his eye had turned white with grief and he choked with suppressed agony

Yusuf,90,0.9081,0.057,0.75,0.192,and he seated his parent high upon the throne and they fell down prostrate before him he said father this is the fulfillment of my dream of long ago which my lord ha made come true he wa certainly gracious to me when he brought me out of the prison and brought you over from the desert after that satan had incited ill feeling between me and my brother indeed my lord is all attentive in bringing about what he wish indeed he is the all knowing the all wise

Al-Kahf,39,0.5975,0.042,0.827,0.131,and fortified their heart when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth we will never invoke any god besides him for then we shall certainly have said an atrocious lie
Al-Kahf,30,0.4551,0.064,0.757,0.179,these our people have taken god besides him why do they not bring any clear authority touching them so who is greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates lie against allah
Al-Kahf,39,0.836,0.0,0.78,0.22,when you have dissociated yourselves from them and from what they worship except allah then take refuge in the cave your lord will unfold his mercy for you and he will help you on to ease in your affair
Al-Kahf,59,-0.2732,0.035,0.965,0.0,you may see the sun when it rise slanting toward the right of their cave and when it set cut across them towards the left and they are in cavern within it that is one of allah sign whomever allah guide is rightly guided and whomever he lead astray you will never find for him any guardian or guide
Al-Kahf,54,0.34,0.056,0.847,0.096,you will suppose them to be awake although they are asleep we turn them to the right and to the left and their dog lie stretching it foreleg at the threshold if you come upon them you will surely turn to flee from them and you will surely be filled with terror of them
Al-Kahf,86,0.765,0.0,0.927,0.073,so it wa that we aroused them from sleep so that they might question one another one of them said how long have you stayed here they said we have stayed day or part of day they said your lord know best how long you have stayed send one of you to the city with this money let him observe which of them ha the purest food and bring you provision from there let him be attentive and let him not make anyone aware of you
Al-Kahf,27,-0.7377,0.2,0.8,0.0,indeed should they prevail over you they will either stone you to death or force you back into their creed and then you will never be saved
Al-Kahf,65,0.6808,0.094,0.726,0.181,so it wa that we let them come upon them that they might know that allah promise is true and that there is no doubt in the hour a they disputed among themselves about their matter they said build building over them their lord know them best those who had the say in their matter said we will set up place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,75,0.8606,0.0,0.871,0.129,they will say they are three their dog is the fourth of them and say they are five their dog is the sixth of them taking shot at the invisible they will say they are seven their dog is the eighth of them say my lord know best their number and none know them except few so do not dispute concerning them except for seeming dispute and do not question about them any of them
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do not say about anything will indeed do it tomorrow
Al-Kahf,27,-0.4047,0.129,0.871,0.0,without adding god willing and when you forget remember your lord and say maybe my lord will guide me to something more akin to rectitude than this
Al-Kahf,16,0.144,0.0,0.906,0.094,they remained in the cave for three hundred year and added nine more to that number
Al-Kahf,43,0.823,0.077,0.701,0.222,say allah know best how long they remained to him belongs the unseen of the heaven and the earth how well doe he see how well doe he hear they have no guardian besides him and none share with him in his judgement
Al-Kahf,27,0.34,0.0,0.915,0.085,recite what ha been revealed to you from the book of your lord nothing can change his word and you will never find any refuge besides him
Al-Kahf,59,0.607,0.0,0.92,0.08,content yourself with the company of those who supplicate their lord morning and evening desiring his face and do not lose sight of them desiring the glitter of the life of this world and do not obey him whose heart we have made oblivious to our remembrance and who follows his own desire and whose conduct is mere profligacy
Al-Kahf,67,-0.2732,0.174,0.653,0.173,and say this is the truth from your lord let anyone who wish believe it and let anyone who wish disbelieve it indeed we have prepared for the wrongdoer fire whose curtain will surround them on all side if they cry out for help they will be helped with water like molten copper which will scald their face what an evil drink and how ill resting place
Al-Kahf,24,0.6167,0.1,0.633,0.267,a for those who have faith and do righteous deed indeed we do not waste the reward of those who are good in deed
Al-Kahf,43,0.9022,0.0,0.763,0.237,for such there will be the garden of eden with stream running in them they will be adorned therein with bracelet of gold and wear green garment of silk and brocade reclining therein on couch how excellent reward and how good resting place
Al-Kahf,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,draw for them the parable of two men for each of whom we had made two garden of vine and we had surrounded them with date palm and placed crop between them
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,both garden yielded their produce without stinting anything of it and we had set stream gushing through them
Al-Kahf,27,0.8588,0.0,0.677,0.323,he had abundant fruit so he said to his companion a he conversed with him have more wealth than you and am stronger with respect to number
Al-Kahf,18,-0.4404,0.146,0.854,0.0,he entered his garden while he wronged himself he said do not think that this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,26,0.7003,0.0,0.805,0.195,and do not think that the hour will ever set in and even if am returned to my lord will surely find resort better than this
Al-Kahf,31,-0.3182,0.133,0.805,0.062,his companion said to him a he conversed with him do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from drop of seminal fluid then fashioned you a man
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but say he is allah my lord and do not ascribe any partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,34,0.5267,0.058,0.794,0.148,why did you not say when you entered your garden this is a allah ha willed there is no power except by allah if you see that have lesser wealth than you and child
Al-Kahf,27,0.4404,0.0,0.9,0.1,maybe my lord will give me something better than your garden and he will unleash upon it bolt from the sky so that it becomes bare plain
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or it water will sink down so that you will never be able to obtain it
Al-Kahf,40,-0.1027,0.133,0.742,0.125,and ruin closed in on his produce and he began to wring his hand for what he had spent on it a it lay fallen on it trellis he wa saying wish had not ascribed any partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,14,0.7096,0.108,0.493,0.399,he had no party to help him besides allah nor could he help himself
Al-Kahf,17,0.9201,0.0,0.498,0.502,there all authority belongs to allah the real he is best in rewarding and best in requiting
Al-Kahf,44,0.5994,0.0,0.896,0.104,draw for them the parable of the life of this world it is like the water we send down from the sky then the earth vegetation mingles with it then it becomes chaff scattered by the wind and allah ha power over all thing
Al-Kahf,27,0.9655,0.0,0.508,0.492,wealth and child are an adornment of the life of the world but lasting righteous deed are better with your lord in reward and better in hope
Al-Kahf,30,0.0382,0.0,0.962,0.038,the day we shall set the mountain moving and you will see the earth in full view we shall muster them and we will not leave out anyone of them
Al-Kahf,34,0.296,0.0,0.904,0.096,they will be presented before your lord in rank certainly you have come to u just a we created you the first time but you maintained that we shall not appoint tryst for you
Al-Kahf,52,-0.4671,0.1,0.855,0.045,the book will be set up then you will see the guilty apprehensive of what is in it they will say woe to u what book is this it omits nothing big or small without enumerating it they will find present whatever they had done and your lord doe not wrong anyone
Al-Kahf,51,-0.9161,0.181,0.819,0.0,when we said to the angel prostrate before adam they prostrated but not iblis he wa one of the jinni so he transgressed against his lord command will you then take him and his offspring for guardian in my stead though they are your enemy how evil substitute for the wrongdoer
Al-Kahf,28,0.7579,0.0,0.762,0.238,did not make them witness to the creation of the heaven and the earth nor to their own creation nor do take those who mislead others a assistant
Al-Kahf,36,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day he will say to the polytheist call those whom you maintained to be my partner they will call them but they will not respond to them for we shall set an abyss between them
Al-Kahf,25,-0.6908,0.246,0.698,0.056,the guilty will sight the fire and know that they are about to fall in it for they will find no way to escape it
Al-Kahf,22,0.1779,0.0,0.925,0.075,we have certainly interspersed this quran with every kind of parable for the people but man is the most disputatious of creature
Al-Kahf,43,-0.5627,0.141,0.815,0.044,nothing ha kept these people from believing and pleading to their lord for forgiveness when guidance came to them except their demand that the precedent of the ancient come to pas for them or that the punishment come to them face to face
Al-Kahf,39,-0.765,0.243,0.654,0.103,we do not send the apostle except a bearer of good news and a warner but those who are faithless dispute fallaciously to refute thereby the truth having taken my sign and what they are warned of in derision
Al-Kahf,59,0.6369,0.033,0.854,0.113,who is greater wrongdoer than he who is reminded of the sign of his lord whereat he disregard them and forgets what his hand have sent ahead indeed we have cast veil on their heart lest they should understand it and deafness into their ear and if you invite them to guidance they will never let themselves be guided
Al-Kahf,41,0.4767,0.046,0.795,0.159,your lord is the all forgiving dispenser of mercy were he to take them to task because of what they have committed he would have surely hastened their punishment but they have tryst when they will not find refuge besides him
Al-Kahf,18,-0.7845,0.301,0.699,0.0,those are the town that we destroyed when they were wrongdoer and we appointed tryst for their destruction
Al-Kahf,25,0.1027,0.0,0.945,0.055,when moses said to his lad will go on journeying until have reached the confluence of the two sea or have spent long time travelling
Al-Kahf,21,0.1689,0.0,0.923,0.077,so when they reached the confluence between them they forgot their fish which found it way into the sea sneaking away
Al-Kahf,26,0.1027,0.073,0.839,0.088,so when they had passed on he said to his lad bring u our meal we have certainly encountered much fatigue on this journey of ours
Al-Kahf,39,0.5927,0.053,0.831,0.117,he said did you see when we took shelter at the rock indeed forgot about the fish and none but satan made me forget to mention it and it made it way into the sea in an amazing manner
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said that is what we were after so they returned retracing their footstep
Al-Kahf,21,0.5423,0.0,0.809,0.191,there they found one of our servant whom we had granted mercy from ourselves and taught him knowledge from our own
Al-Kahf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said to him may follow you for the purpose that you teach me some of the probity you have been taught
Al-Kahf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said indeed you cannot have patience with me
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how can you have patience about something you do not comprehend
Al-Kahf,19,0.296,0.0,0.842,0.158,he said you will find me god willing to be patient and will not disobey you in any matter
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said if you follow me do not question me concerning anything until myself first mention it for you
Al-Kahf,33,-0.3182,0.1,0.836,0.065,so they went on and when they boarded the boat he made hole in it he said did you make hole in it to drown it people you have certainly done monstrous thing
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not say that you cannot have patience with me
Al-Kahf,18,0.0762,0.0,0.929,0.071,he said do not take me to task for my forgetting and do not be hard upon me
Al-Kahf,32,0.2023,0.082,0.788,0.13,so they went on until they came upon boy whereat he slew him he said did you slay an innocent soul without his having slain anyone you have certainly done dire thing
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell you that you cannot have patience with me
Al-Kahf,24,0.0772,0.0,0.947,0.053,he said if question you about anything after this do not keep me in your company you already have enough excuse on my part
Al-Kahf,51,-0.7227,0.124,0.84,0.036,so they went on until they came to the people of town they asked it people for food but they refused to extend them any hospitality there they found wall which wa about to collapse so he erected it he said had you wished you could have taken wage for it
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this is where you and shall part will inform you about the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience
Al-Kahf,29,-0.7184,0.188,0.812,0.0,a for the boat it belonged to some poor people who work on the sea wanted to make it defective for behind them wa king seizing every ship usurpingly
Al-Kahf,20,-0.3612,0.263,0.617,0.119,a for the boy his parent were faithful person and we feared he would overwhelm them with rebellion and unfaith
Al-Kahf,23,0.8714,0.0,0.636,0.364,so we desired that their lord should give them in exchange one better than him in respect of purity and closer in mercy
Al-Kahf,69,0.8055,0.0,0.872,0.128,a for the wall it belonged to two boy orphan in the city under it there wa treasure belonging to them their father had been righteous man so your lord desired that they should come of age and take out their treasure a mercy from your lord did not do that out of my own accord this is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they question you concerning dhul qarnayn say will relate to you an account of him
Al-Kahf,17,0.25,0.0,0.889,0.111,indeed we had granted him power in the land and given him the mean to all thing
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he directed mean
Al-Kahf,36,0.5574,0.078,0.714,0.207,when he reached the place where the sun set he found it setting over warm sea and by it he found people we said dhul qarnayn you will either punish them or treat them with kindness
Al-Kahf,28,-0.9186,0.361,0.639,0.0,he said a for him who is wrongdoer we will punish him then he shall be returned to his lord and he will punish him with dire punishment
Al-Kahf,26,0.9735,0.0,0.482,0.518,but a for him who ha faith and act righteously he shall have the best reward and we will assign him easy task under our command
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereafter he directed another mean
Al-Kahf,25,0.1027,0.0,0.945,0.055,when he reached the place where the sun rise he found it rising on people for whom we had not provided any shield against it
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so it wa and we were fully aware of whatever mean he possessed
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereafter he directed another mean
Al-Kahf,22,-0.0258,0.066,0.873,0.061,when he reached the place between the two barrier he found between them people who could hardly understand word of his language
Al-Kahf,29,-0.7184,0.219,0.781,0.0,they said dhul qarnayn indeed gog and magog are causing disaster in this land shall we pay you tribute on condition that you build barrier between them and u
Al-Kahf,24,0.8807,0.0,0.641,0.359,he said what my lord ha furnished me is better yet help me with some strength and will make bulwark between you and them
Al-Kahf,33,-0.34,0.07,0.93,0.0,bring me piece of iron when he had levelled up between the flank he said blow when he had turned it into fire he said bring me molten copper to pour over it
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they could neither scale it nor could they make hole in it
Al-Kahf,27,0.9331,0.0,0.594,0.406,he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord is fulfilled he will level it and my lord promise is true
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that day we shall let them surge over one another the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them all
Al-Kahf,14,-0.765,0.355,0.645,0.0,and on that day we shall bring hell into view visibly for the faithless
Al-Kahf,13,-0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,those whose eye were blind to my remembrance and who could not hear
Al-Kahf,26,-0.7717,0.265,0.677,0.058,do the faithless suppose that they have taken my servant for guardian in my stead indeed we have prepared hell for the hospitality of the faithless
Al-Kahf,13,-0.5267,0.221,0.779,0.0,say shall we inform you who are the biggest loser in their work
Al-Kahf,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,those whose effort are misguided in the life of the world while they suppose they are doing good
Al-Kahf,32,-0.6908,0.16,0.84,0.0,they are the one who deny the sign of their lord and encounter with him so their work have failed on the day of resurrection we will not give them any weight
Al-Kahf,16,-0.7964,0.336,0.664,0.0,that is their requital hell because of their unfaith and for deriding my sign and apostle
Al-Kahf,19,0.4215,0.0,0.859,0.141,a for those who have faith and do righteous deed they shall have the garden of firdaws for abode
Al-Kahf,15,0.0382,0.0,0.924,0.076,to remain in them forever they will not seek to leave it for another place
Al-Kahf,33,0.3612,0.0,0.928,0.072,say if the sea were ink for the word of my lord the sea would be spent before the word of my lord are finished though we replenish it with another like it
Al-Kahf,41,0.8519,0.0,0.761,0.239,say am just human being like you it ha been revealed to me that your god is the one god so whoever expects to encounter his lord let him act righteously and not associate anyone with the worship of his lord

Al-Qasas,18,0.6908,0.0,0.737,0.263,we relate to you truly some of the account of moses and pharaoh for people who have faith
Al-Qasas,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed pharaoh tyrannized over the land reducing it people to faction abasing one group of them slaughtering their son and sparing their woman indeed he wa one of the agent of corruption
Al-Qasas,25,0.6124,0.0,0.821,0.179,and we desired to show favour to those who were abased in the land and to make them imam and to make them the heir
Al-Qasas,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and to establish them in the land and to show pharaoh and haman and their host from them that of which they were apprehensive
Al-Qasas,39,-0.4617,0.14,0.764,0.096,we revealed to moses mother saying nurse him then when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear or grieve for we will restore him to you and make him one of the apostle
Al-Qasas,27,-0.7717,0.211,0.789,0.0,then pharaoh kinsman picked him up that he might be an enemy and cause of grief to them indeed pharaoh and haman and their host were iniquitous
Al-Qasas,38,0.6672,0.0,0.811,0.189,pharaoh wife said to him this infant will be source of comfort to me and to you do not kill him maybe he will benefit u or we will adopt him a son but they were not aware
Al-Qasas,30,0.6249,0.0,0.846,0.154,the heart of moses mother became desolate and indeed she wa about to divulge it had we not fortified her heart so that she might have faith in allah promise
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,she said to his sister follow him so she watched him from distance while they were not aware
Al-Qasas,34,0.3612,0.072,0.793,0.136,since before we had forbidden him to be suckled by any nurse so she said shall show you household that will take care of him for you and they will be his well wishers
Al-Qasas,35,0.6948,0.0,0.774,0.226,that is how we restored him to his mother so that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that allah promise is true but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,22,0.7964,0.0,0.738,0.262,when he came of age and became fully matured we gave him judgement and knowledge and thus do we reward the virtuous
Al-Qasas,75,-0.8225,0.149,0.789,0.062,one day he entered the city at time when it people were not likely to take notice he found there two men fighting this one from among his follower and that one from his enemy the one who wa from his follower sought his help against him who wa from his enemy so moses hit him with his fist whereupon he expired he said this is of satan doing indeed he is clearly misguiding enemy
Al-Qasas,22,0.5829,0.101,0.63,0.269,he said my lord have wronged myself forgive me so he forgave him indeed he is the all forgiving the all merciful
Al-Qasas,16,0.0736,0.225,0.585,0.19,he said my lord a you have blessed me will never be supporter of the guilty
Al-Qasas,37,0.4215,0.128,0.662,0.209,he rose at dawn in the city fearful and vigilant when behold the one who had sought his help the day before shouted for his help once again moses said to him you are indeed clearly perverse
Al-Qasas,52,-0.964,0.307,0.608,0.085,but when he wanted to strike him who wa an enemy of both of them he said moses do you want to kill me just like the one you killed yesterday you only want to be tyrant in the land and you do not desire to be one who brings about reform
Al-Qasas,26,-0.624,0.198,0.735,0.067,there came man from the city outskirt hurrying he said moses the elite are indeed conspiring to kill you so leave am indeed your well wisher
Al-Qasas,18,-0.3612,0.153,0.766,0.081,so he left the city fearful and vigilant he said my lord deliver me from the wrongdoing lot
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he turned his face toward midian he said maybe my lord will show me the right way
Al-Qasas,57,0.2732,0.0,0.964,0.036,when he arrived at the well of midian he found there throng of people watering their flock and he found besides them two woman holding back their flock he said what is your business they said we do not water our flock until the shepherd have driven out their flock and our father is an aged man
Al-Qasas,30,0.4404,0.0,0.909,0.091,so he watered their flock for them then he withdrew toward the shade and said my lord am indeed in need of any good you may send down to me
Al-Qasas,54,0.1027,0.026,0.923,0.052,then one of the two woman approached him walking bashfully she said indeed my father invite you to pay you the wage for watering our flock for u so when he came to him and recounted the story to him he said do not be afraid you have been delivered from the wrongdoing lot
Al-Qasas,20,0.891,0.0,0.616,0.384,one of the two woman said father hire him indeed the best you can hire is powerful and trustworthy man
Al-Qasas,55,0.4902,0.045,0.873,0.082,he said indeed desire to marry you to one of these two daughter of mine on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight year and if you complete ten that will be up to you and do not want to be hard on you god willing you will find me to righteous person
Al-Qasas,32,-0.0772,0.065,0.88,0.056,he said this will be by consent between you and me whichever of the two term complete there shall be no imposition upon me and allah is witness over what we say
Al-Qasas,48,-0.6486,0.136,0.829,0.036,so when moses completed the term and set out with his family he descried fire on the side of the mountain he said to his family wait indeed descry fire maybe will bring you some news from it or brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,31,0.5994,0.0,0.885,0.115,when he approached it he wa called from the right bank of the valley in that blessed site from the tree moses indeed am allah the lord of all the world
Al-Qasas,37,0.4404,0.0,0.923,0.077,and throw down your staff and when he saw it wriggling a if it were snake he turned his back to flee without looking back moses come forward and do not be afraid indeed you are safe
Al-Qasas,41,0.666,0.0,0.877,0.123,insert your hand into your shirt it will emerge white without any fault and keep your arm drawn in awe to your side these shall be two proof from your lord to pharaoh and his elite they are indeed transgressing lot
Al-Qasas,17,-0.9362,0.487,0.513,0.0,he said my lord indeed have killed one of their men so fear they will kill me
Al-Qasas,28,-0.2023,0.105,0.817,0.078,aaron my brother he is more eloquent than me in speech so send him with me a helper to confirm me for fear that they will impugn me
Al-Qasas,46,0.6486,0.0,0.872,0.128,he said we will strengthen your arm by mean of your brother and invest both of you with such authority that they will not touch you with the help of our sign you two and those who follow the two of you shall be the victor
Al-Qasas,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when moses brought them our manifest sign they said this is nothing but concocted magic we never heard of such thing among our forefather
Al-Qasas,28,0.7964,0.0,0.785,0.215,moses said my lord know best who brings guidance from him and in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be the wrongdoer will not be felicitous
Al-Qasas,44,-0.3612,0.114,0.802,0.084,pharaoh said member of the elite do not know of any god that you may have besides me haman light for me fire over clay and build me tower so that may take look at moses god and indeed consider him to be liar
Al-Qasas,20,-0.4215,0.135,0.865,0.0,he and his host unduly acted arrogantly in the land and thought they would not be brought back to u
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we seized him and his host and threw them into the sea so observe how wa the fate of the wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,21,-0.4692,0.192,0.742,0.066,we made them leader who invite to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not receive any help
Al-Qasas,20,-0.5423,0.156,0.844,0.0,we made curse pursue them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be among the disfigured
Al-Qasas,29,0.1779,0.097,0.755,0.148,certainly we gave moses the book after we had destroyed the former generation a set of eye opener guidance and mercy for mankind so that they may take admonition
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you were not on the western side when we revealed the commandment to moses nor were you among the witness
Al-Qasas,38,-0.1419,0.04,0.96,0.0,but we brought forth other generation and time took it toll on them you did not dwell among the people of midian reciting to them our sign but it is we who are the sender of the apostle
Al-Qasas,47,0.3919,0.033,0.901,0.067,and you were not on the side of the mount when we called out to moses but we have sent you a mercy from your lord that you may warn people to whom there did not come any warner before you so that they may take admonition
Al-Qasas,43,0.7269,0.0,0.868,0.132,and lest if an affliction were to befall them because of what their hand have sent ahead they should say our lord why did you not send u an apostle so that we might have followed your sign and been among the faithful
Al-Qasas,49,0.918,0.0,0.755,0.245,but when there came to them the truth from u they said why ha he not been given the like of what moses wa given did they not disbelieve what moses wa given before and said two magician abetting each other and said indeed we disbelieve both of them
Al-Qasas,23,0.7096,0.0,0.781,0.219,say if you are truthful bring some book from allah better in guidance than the two on them so that may follow it
Al-Qasas,40,0.6597,0.0,0.876,0.124,then if they do not respond to you summons know that they only follow their desire and who is more astray than him who follows his desire without any guidance from allah indeed allah doe not guide the wrongdoing lot
Al-Qasas,15,0.34,0.0,0.854,0.146,certainly we have carried on this discourse for them so that they may take admonition
Al-Qasas,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the book before it are the one who believe in it
Al-Qasas,29,0.3182,0.0,0.924,0.076,and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it it is indeed the truth from our lord indeed we were muslim even before it came
Al-Qasas,26,0.296,0.129,0.676,0.194,those will be given their reward two time for their patience they repel evil conduct with good and spend out of what we have provided them
Al-Qasas,32,0.0808,0.134,0.724,0.142,and when they hear vain talk they avoid it and say our deed belong to u and your deed belong to you peace be to you we do not court the ignorant
Al-Qasas,23,0.9042,0.0,0.641,0.359,you cannot guide whomever you wish but it is allah who guide whomever he wish and he know best those who are guided
Al-Qasas,43,-0.0818,0.08,0.869,0.05,they say if we follow the guidance with you we will be forced out of our territory did we not establish secure sanctuary for them where fruit of all kind are brought a provision from u but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,27,-0.4767,0.109,0.853,0.038,how many town we have destroyed that exulted in it lifestyle there lie their dwelling uninhabited after them except by few and we were the sole inheritor
Al-Qasas,35,0.6908,0.0,0.853,0.147,your lord would not destroy the town until he had raised an apostle in their mother city to recite to them our sign we would never destroy the town except when their people were wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,35,0.4404,0.0,0.921,0.079,whatever thing you have been given are only the ware of the life of this world and it glitter and what is with allah is better and more lasting will you not exercise your reason
Al-Qasas,37,0.5187,0.0,0.864,0.136,is he to whom we have given good promise which he will receive like him whom we have provided the ware of the life of this world but who will be arraigned on the day of resurrection
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day he will call out to them and ask where are my partner that you used to claim
Al-Qasas,40,-0.9152,0.273,0.727,0.0,those against whom the word had become due will say our lord these are the one whom we have perverted we perverted them a we were perverse ourselves we repudiate them before you it wa not u that they worshipped
Al-Qasas,30,-0.4497,0.124,0.808,0.068,it will be said invoke your partner so they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and they will sight the punishment wishing they had followed guidance
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day he will call out to them and say what response did you give to the apostle
Al-Qasas,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that day all information will be withheld from them so they will not question one another
Al-Qasas,17,0.6369,0.0,0.729,0.271,a for him who repents ha faith and act righteously maybe he will be among the felicitous
Al-Qasas,26,0.3818,0.073,0.767,0.16,your lord creates whatever he wish and chooses they have no choice immaculate is allah and exalted above having any partner that they ascribe to him
Al-Qasas,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,your lord know whatever their breast conceal and whatever they disclose
Al-Qasas,33,0.5423,0.058,0.792,0.15,he is allah there is no god except him all praise belongs to him in this world and the hereafter all judgement belongs to him and to him you will be brought back
Al-Qasas,31,0.2732,0.0,0.935,0.065,say tell me if allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the day of resurrection what god other than allah can bring you light will you not listen
Al-Qasas,35,0.2732,0.0,0.942,0.058,say tell me if allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the day of resurrection what god other than allah can bring you night wherein you can rest will you not perceive
Al-Qasas,34,0.7783,0.0,0.799,0.201,he ha made for you the night and the day out of his mercy so that you may rest therein and that you may seek his bounty and so that you may give thanks
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day he will call out to them and say where are my partner that you used to claim
Al-Qasas,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we shall draw from every nation witness and say produce your evidence then they will know that all reality belongs to allah and what they used to fabricate will forsake them
Al-Qasas,45,-0.7267,0.155,0.785,0.06,korah indeed belonged to the people of moses but he bullied them we had given him so much treasure that their chest indeed proved heavy for band of stalwart when his people said to him do not boast indeed allah doe not like the boaster
Al-Qasas,53,0.7651,0.066,0.759,0.175,seek the abode of the hereafter by mean of what allah ha given you while not forgetting your share of this world be good to others just a allah ha been good to you and do not try to cause corruption in the land indeed allah doe not like the agent of corruption
Al-Qasas,49,-0.1308,0.156,0.681,0.164,he said have indeed been given all this because of the knowledge that have did he not know that allah had already destroyed before him some of the generation who were more powerful than him and greater in amassing wealth the guilty will not be questioned about their sin
Al-Qasas,33,0.8977,0.0,0.685,0.315,so he emerged before his people in his finery those who desired the life of the world said we wish we had like what korah ha been given indeed he is greatly fortunate
Al-Qasas,32,0.7783,0.117,0.607,0.276,those who were given knowledge said to them woe to you allah reward is better for someone who ha faith and act righteously and no one will receive it except the patient
Al-Qasas,27,0.1022,0.148,0.693,0.16,so we caused the earth to swallow him and his house and he had no party that might protect him from allah nor could he rescue himself
Al-Qasas,57,-0.0788,0.074,0.857,0.069,by dawn those who longed to be in his place the day before were saying don you see that allah expands the provision for whomever he wish of his servant and tightens it had allah not shown u favour he might have made the earth swallow u too don you see that the faithless do not prosper

Muhammad,19,0.1027,0.093,0.794,0.112,those who are themselves faithless and bar others from the way of allah he ha rendered their work fruitless
Muhammad,39,0.9109,0.0,0.736,0.264,but those who have faith and do righteous deed and believe in what ha been sent down to muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he shall absolve them of their misdeed and set right their affair

Muhammad,17,-0.0772,0.199,0.664,0.137,that is because allah is the protector of the faithful and because the faithless have no protector
Muhammad,39,0.7096,0.094,0.685,0.221,indeed allah will admit those who have faith and do righteous deed into garden with stream running in them a for the faithless they enjoy and eat like the cattle do and the fire will be their final abode

Muhammad,72,0.8885,0.053,0.769,0.178,description of the paradise promised to the godwary therein are stream of unstaling water and stream of milk unchanging in flavour and stream of wine delicious to the drinker and stream of purified honey there will be every kind of fruit in it for them and forgiveness from their lord are such one like those who abide in the fire and are given to drink boiling water which cut up their bowel
Muhammad,52,0.714,0.03,0.854,0.116,there are some among them who prick up their ear at you but when they go out from your presence they say to those who have been given knowledge what did he say just now they are the one on whose heart allah ha set seal and they follow their own desire
Muhammad,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a for those who are rightly guided he enhances their guidance and invests them with their godwariness
Muhammad,30,0.1027,0.0,0.954,0.046,do they await anything except that the hour should overtake them suddenly it portent have already come when it overtakes them of what avail will the admonition they were given
Muhammad,32,0.0772,0.145,0.677,0.178,know that there is no god except allah and plead to allah for forgiveness of your sin and for the faithful men and woman allah know your itinerary and your final abode
Muhammad,45,-0.9491,0.267,0.7,0.033,the faithful say if only surah were sent down but when conclusive surah is sent down and war is mentioned in it you see those in whose heart is sickness looking upon you with the look of someone fainting at death so woe to them
Muhammad,29,0.8,0.098,0.55,0.352,obedience and upright speech so when the matter ha been resolved upon concerning going to war if they remain true to allah that will surely be better for them
Muhammad,24,0.0516,0.101,0.755,0.144,may it not be that if you were to wield authority you would cause corruption in the land and ill treat your blood relation
Muhammad,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,they are the one whom allah ha cursed so he made them deaf and blinded their sight
Muhammad,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they not contemplate the quran or are there lock on the heart
Muhammad,29,0.4588,0.074,0.765,0.162,indeed those who turned their back after the guidance had become clear to them it wa satan who had seduced them and he had given them far flung hope
Muhammad,27,-0.4588,0.106,0.856,0.038,that is because they said to those who loathed what allah had sent down we shall obey you in some matter and allah know their secret dealing
Muhammad,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but how will it be with them when the angel take them away striking their face and their back
Muhammad,18,-0.4804,0.329,0.45,0.221,that because they pursued what displeased allah and loathed his pleasure so he ha made their work fail
Muhammad,15,0.4973,0.0,0.755,0.245,do those in whose heart is sickness suppose that allah will not expose their spite
Muhammad,32,0.4019,0.0,0.92,0.08,if we wish we will show them to you so that you recognize them by their mark yet you will recognize them by their tone of speech and allah know your deed
Muhammad,25,0.5994,0.0,0.824,0.176,we will surely test you until we ascertain those of you who wage jihad and those who are steadfast and we shall appraise your record
Muhammad,38,0.3129,0.119,0.713,0.168,indeed those who are faithless and bar from the way of allah and defy the apostle after guidance ha become clear to them they will not hurt allah in the least and he shall make their work fail
Muhammad,17,0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149,you who have faith obey allah and obey the apostle and do not render your work void
Muhammad,21,-0.8278,0.364,0.636,0.0,indeed those who are faithless and bar from the way of allah and then die faithless allah will never forgive them
Muhammad,31,-0.3915,0.158,0.756,0.086,so do not slacken and do not call for peace when you have the upper hand and allah is with you and he will not stint the reward of your work
Muhammad,33,0.7997,0.08,0.674,0.246,the life of the world is just play and diversion but if you are faithful and godwary he will give you your reward and will not ask your wealth in return from you
Muhammad,19,-0.765,0.322,0.678,0.0,should he ask it from you and press you you will be stingy and he will expose your spite
Muhammad,60,-0.8836,0.183,0.817,0.0,ah there you are being invited to spend in the way of allah yet among you there are those who are stingy and whoever is stingy is stingy only to himself allah is the all sufficient and you are all needy and if you turn away he will replace you with another people and they will not be like you

Al-Hadeed,31,0.4005,0.058,0.836,0.106,it is he who sends down manifest sign to his servant that he may bring you out of darkness into light and indeed allah is most kind and merciful to you
Al-Hadeed,70,0.9442,0.053,0.707,0.24,why should you not spend in the way of allah when to allah belongs the heritage of the heaven and the earth those of you who spent their mean and fought before the victory are not equal to others they are greater in rank than those who have spent and fought afterwards yet allah ha promised the best reward to each and allah is well aware of what you do
Al-Hadeed,25,0.8625,0.0,0.696,0.304,who is it that will lend allah good loan that he may multiply it for him and that there may be noble reward for him
Al-Hadeed,53,0.9509,0.0,0.724,0.276,the day you will see the faithful men and woman with their light moving swiftly in front of them and on their right and they are greeted with the word there is good news for you today garden with stream running in them to remain in them forever that is the great success
Al-Hadeed,49,0.5423,0.057,0.805,0.138,the day the hypocrite men and woman will say to the faithful please wait that we may glean something from your light they will be told go back and grope for light then there will be set up between them wall with gate with mercy within and punishment without
Al-Hadeed,47,-0.7269,0.202,0.701,0.097,they will call out to them did we not use to be with you they will say yes but you cast yourselves into perdition you awaited and were skeptical and false hope deceived you until the edict of allah came and the deceiver deceived you concerning allah

Al-Hadeed,59,0.6586,0.033,0.851,0.116,is it not time yet for those who have faith that their heart should be humbled for allah remembrance and toward the truth which ha come down to them and to be not like those who were given the book before time took it toll on them and so their heart were hardened and many of them are transgressor
Al-Hadeed,25,0.4019,0.12,0.646,0.234,know that allah revives the earth after it death we have certainly made the sign clear for you so that you may exercise your reason
Al-Hadeed,27,0.9062,0.0,0.652,0.348,indeed the charitable men and woman and those who lend allah good loan it shall be multiplied for them and there will be noble reward for them
Al-Hadeed,47,-0.8294,0.206,0.687,0.107,those who have faith in allah and his apostle it is they who are the truthful and witness with their lord they shall have their reward and their light but a for those who are faithless and deny our sign they shall be the inmate of hell
Al-Hadeed,71,0.802,0.049,0.762,0.189,know that the life of this world is mere diversion and play glamour and mutual vainglory among you and rivalry for wealth and child like rain whose growth impress the farmer then it withers and you see it turn yellow then it becomes chaff whereas in the hereafter there is forgiveness from allah and his approval and severe punishment the life of this world is nothing but the ware of delusion
Al-Hadeed,47,0.9803,0.0,0.545,0.455,take the lead towards forgiveness from your lord and paradise a vast a the heaven and the earth prepared for those who have faith in allah and his apostle that is allah grace which he grant to whomever he wish and allah is dispenser of great grace
Al-Hadeed,23,0.5023,0.06,0.794,0.146,no affliction visit the land or yourselves but it is in book before we bring it about that is indeed easy for allah
Al-Hadeed,25,0.196,0.075,0.786,0.139,so that you may not grieve for what escape you nor boast for what come your way and allah doe not like any swaggering braggart
Al-Hadeed,29,-0.7506,0.228,0.772,0.0,such a are themselves stingy and bid other people to be stingy and whoever refuse to comply should know that indeed allah is the all sufficient the all laudable
Al-Hadeed,65,0.9565,0.0,0.759,0.241,certainly we sent our apostle with manifest proof and we sent down with them the book and the balance so that mankind may maintain justice and we sent down iron in which there is great might and us for mankind and so that allah may know those who help him and his apostle with faith in the unseen indeed allah is all strong all mighty
Al-Hadeed,28,0.34,0.0,0.918,0.082,certainly we sent noah and abraham and we ordained among their descendant prophethood and the book some of them are rightly guided and many of them are transgressor
Al-Hadeed,81,0.9565,0.0,0.809,0.191,then we followed them up with our apostle and we followed them with jesus son of mary and we gave him the evangel and we put kindness and mercy into the heart of those who followed him but a for monasticism they innovated it we had not prescribed it for them only seeking allah pleasure yet they did not observe it with due observance so we gave to the faithful among them their due reward but many of them are transgressor
Al-Hadeed,40,0.9413,0.0,0.65,0.35,you who have faith be wary of allah and have faith in his apostle he will grant you double share of his mercy and light to walk by and he will forgive you and allah is all forgiving all merciful
Al-Hadeed,41,0.6709,0.133,0.648,0.219,so that the people of the book may know that they do not control allah grace in any wise and that in allah hand is all grace which he grant to whomever he wish and allah is dispenser of mighty grace
Al-Mujadila,35,0.296,0.066,0.812,0.122,allah ha certainly heard the speech of her who pleads with you about her husband and complains to allah allah hears the conversation between the two of you indeed allah is all hearing all seeing
Al-Mujadila,39,-0.34,0.123,0.81,0.067,a for those of you who repudiate their wife by zihar they are not their mother their mother are only those who bore them and indeed they utter an outrage and lie indeed allah is all excusing all forgiving
Al-Mujadila,40,0.6597,0.0,0.876,0.124,those who repudiate their wife by ih and then retract what they have said shall set free slave before they may touch each other this you are advised to carry out and allah is well aware of what you do
Al-Mujadila,53,-0.8075,0.206,0.718,0.076,he who cannot afford to free slave shall fast for two successive month before they may touch each other if he cannot do so he shall feed sixty needy person this that you may have faith in allah and his apostle these are allah bound and there is painful punishment for the faithless
Al-Mujadila,35,-0.6124,0.186,0.754,0.06,indeed those who oppose allah and his apostle will be subdued just a those who passed before them were subdued we have certainly sent down manifest sign and there is humiliating punishment for the faithless
Al-Mujadila,35,0.128,0.051,0.885,0.064,the day when allah will raise them all together he will inform them about what they have done allah ha kept account of it while they have forgotten and allah is witness to all thing
