Al-Araf,21,-0.2023,0.121,0.792,0.088,who turned people away from the path of god and sought to make it appear crooked and who denied the hereafter
Al-Araf,49,0.6908,0.023,0.865,0.112,barrier will divide the two group and on the height there will be men who recognize each group by their mark they will call out to the people of the garden peace be with you they will not have yet entered but they will be hoping to do so
Al-Araf,24,-0.34,0.098,0.902,0.0,and when they turn their eye towards the inmate of the fire they will say our lord do not include u among the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,27,0.7783,0.0,0.755,0.245,and the people of the height will call out to men they recognize by their mark what use have your great number and your false pride been
Al-Araf,26,-0.7303,0.287,0.646,0.067,see are these not the people you swore would never earn god mercy enter the garden no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve

Al-Araf,40,-0.5859,0.121,0.879,0.0,who treated religion a pastime and an idle sport and whom the life of the world had beguiled on that day we shall forget them a they forgot their meeting of that day with u for they denied our revelation
Al-Araf,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,and surely we have brought them book which we have expounded with knowledge guide and mercy for those who believe
Al-Araf,78,-0.4939,0.093,0.851,0.056,do they wait for the fulfillment of that of which it warns on the day when that fulfillment come those who had neglected it before will say the messenger of our lord did indeed bring the truth have we then any intercessor who would intercede for u or could we be sent back so that we might act differently from the way we used to they have indeed ruined their soul and what they invented ha forsaken them
Al-Araf,72,0.946,0.0,0.768,0.232,your lord is god who created the heaven and the earth in six day period and then settled himself firmly on the throne he throw the veil of night over the day each seeking the other in rapid succession it wa he who created the sun the moon and the star and made them subservient to his will his is the creation his the command blessed be god lord of the universe
Al-Araf,15,-0.5216,0.194,0.806,0.0,call on your lord with humility and in secret he doe not love the transgressor
Al-Araf,30,0.872,0.077,0.557,0.366,do not spread corruption on the earth after it ha been set in order pray to him with fear and hope god mercy is close to those who do good
Al-Araf,55,-0.7184,0.138,0.788,0.074,it is god who sends forth the wind a harbinger of his mercy and when they have gathered up the heavy cloud we drive them on to dead land where we cause rain to fall bringing out all kind of fruit just a we will raise the dead to life perhaps you will take heed
Al-Araf,34,0.0129,0.114,0.746,0.14,vegetation come out of good land in abundance by the will of it lord but out of bad land only scantily thus we explain our sign in diverse way for those who give thanks
Al-Araf,27,-0.9072,0.363,0.516,0.121,we sent noah to his people he said my people worship god you have no other god but he fear for you the punishment of dreadful day
Al-Araf,18,-0.3919,0.256,0.592,0.152,but the leading men of his people said truly we see that you are obviously lost in error
Al-Araf,17,0.3089,0.0,0.876,0.124,said noah my people am not in error indeed am messenger from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,20,0.7351,0.0,0.702,0.298,am conveying my lord message to you and giving you sincere advice know thing from god that you do not
Al-Araf,35,-0.3327,0.168,0.722,0.111,do you find it so strange that message should come from your lord through man from among yourselves so that he may warn you and so that you may fear god and be shown mercy
Al-Araf,28,-0.9335,0.388,0.519,0.093,but they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who rejected our sign they were indeed blind people
Al-Araf,30,0.8293,0.043,0.65,0.307,to the people of ad we sent their brother hud he said my people worship god you have no other god but he then will you not be god fearing
Al-Araf,26,-0.6597,0.241,0.688,0.072,the leading men of his people who refused to acknowledge the truth said we can see you are foolish man and we think you are lying
Al-Araf,19,-0.3716,0.173,0.827,0.0,he said my people am by no mean fool but rather am messenger from the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,14,0.7184,0.0,0.667,0.333,am conveying my lord message to you and am your sincere and honest adviser
Al-Araf,46,0.7003,0.061,0.766,0.172,do you find it strange that message should come from your lord through one of your own men to warn you remember how he made you successor of noah people and increased you greatly in stature remember the favour of god so that you may prosper
Al-Araf,32,0.3818,0.128,0.67,0.201,they said have you come to tell u to serve god alone and to forsake the god our forefather served bring u then what you threaten u with if you are truthful
Al-Araf,44,-0.7184,0.201,0.69,0.108,he said your lord wrath and indignation have already fallen upon you would you dispute with me about mere name which you and your father have invented and for which god ha revealed no authority wait then if you will am waiting alongside you
Al-Araf,24,0.34,0.099,0.719,0.182,then we saved him and those who were with him by our mercy we annihilated those who denied our sign and would not believe
Al-Araf,61,0.6625,0.125,0.642,0.233,to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said my people worship god you have no other god but him veritable proof ha come to you from your lord this is god she camel sign for you so let her feed in god land and do not harm her in any way or you will be overwhelmed by painful punishment
Al-Araf,39,0.7351,0.0,0.833,0.167,remember when he made you successor to the ad and settled you in the land you built palace on it plain and carved house out of the mountain remember god blessing and do not spread corruption in the land
Al-Araf,41,-0.5267,0.16,0.727,0.113,but the arrogant leader of his people said to the believer who were deemed weak do you know for certain that salih is one sent from his lord they replied we believe in the message which ha been sent through him
Al-Araf,10,-0.7096,0.424,0.576,0.0,the arrogant leader said we reject what you believe in
Al-Araf,29,-0.3818,0.091,0.909,0.0,so they hamstrung the she camel and insolently defied the commandment of their lord saying salih bring upon u what you threaten u with if you are indeed messenger
Al-Araf,14,0.144,0.0,0.824,0.176,so the earthquake overwhelmed them and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place
Al-Araf,23,-0.5426,0.201,0.725,0.074,he left them saying my people delivered my lord message to you and counselled you sincerely but you do not like sincere advisor
Al-Araf,26,0.34,0.076,0.764,0.16,we sent lot who said to his people how can you commit an abomination such a no one in the world ha ever done before you
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you lust after men rather than woman you transgress all bound
Al-Araf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the only answer given by his people wa turn them out of your town they are people who regard themselves to be pure
Al-Araf,19,0.4728,0.0,0.854,0.146,so we saved him and his family except for his wife she wa one of those who stayed behind
Al-Araf,18,-0.6597,0.206,0.794,0.0,we rained down on them shower of brimstone then see what wa the end of the evil doer
Al-Araf,66,0.9598,0.02,0.709,0.272,to midian we sent their brother shu ayb he said my people worship god you have no other god but him clear sign ha indeed come to you from your lord so give full measure and full weight and do not deliver short do not corrupt the land after it ha been set in order this is for your own good if you are true believer
Al-Araf,46,-0.25,0.068,0.863,0.068,do not lie in ambush on every pathway threatening people barring those who believe from the way of god seeking to make it appear crooked remember when you were few in number and he multiplied you consider the fate of those who used to spread corruption
Al-Araf,31,0.6249,0.062,0.761,0.177,and if there is group of you which belief in my message and others who disbelieve it be patient until god shall judge between u he is the best of judge
Al-Araf,33,-0.5106,0.157,0.771,0.072,the arrogant leader of his people said shu ayb we will expel you and your fellow believer from our town unless you return to our faith he said even though we detest it
Al-Araf,67,0.9628,0.02,0.684,0.296,we would be inventing lie against god if we returned to your faith after god ha delivered u from it it is not for u to return to it unless god our lord so willed our lord encompasses all thing in his knowledge we have put our trust in god our lord expose the truth and judge between u and our people you are the best judge
Al-Araf,25,-0.2732,0.184,0.667,0.149,the leading men of his people who were bent on denying the truth said if you follow shu ayb you will certainly be the loser
Al-Araf,14,-0.5267,0.207,0.793,0.0,thereupon an earthquake overtook them and morning found them lying flattened in their home
Al-Araf,23,-0.8481,0.326,0.674,0.0,those who had denied shu ayb became a though they had never lived there those who denied shu ayb were themselves the loser
Al-Araf,30,-0.3321,0.146,0.777,0.078,so he turned away from them saying my people delivered my lord message to you and gave you sincere advice so why should grieve for people who refused to believe
Al-Araf,22,-0.743,0.295,0.632,0.074,whenever we sent prophet to town we afflicted it people with suffering and adversity so that they might humble themselves before god
Al-Araf,28,-0.3818,0.156,0.767,0.077,and then we changed their hardship into ease until they grew affluent and said our father had also experienced adversity and prosperity then we seized them suddenly unawares
Al-Araf,36,0.0516,0.145,0.662,0.193,had the people of those town believed in and feared god we would have showered upon them blessing from heaven and earth but they rejected the truth so we seized them on account of their misdeed
Al-Araf,23,-0.2023,0.12,0.789,0.09,do the people of these town now feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep
Al-Araf,21,0.1531,0.123,0.692,0.185,or do they feel secure against the coming of our punishment upon them in the forenoon while they are at play
Al-Araf,20,-0.4939,0.317,0.404,0.28,do they feel secure against god devising no one feel secure against god devising except for those doomed to ruin
Al-Araf,44,-0.7906,0.143,0.857,0.0,doe it not guide the people who inherit the land from former people that we can punish them for their sin if we will and seal up their heart so that they would not be able to lend an ear to word of guidance
Al-Araf,42,-0.2846,0.145,0.712,0.142,we have told you the story of those town their messenger came to them with clear sign but they were never going to believe in something they had already rejected thus god seal up the heart of those who deny the truth
Al-Araf,18,-0.2263,0.101,0.899,0.0,we found most of them untrue to their covenant indeed we found most of them to be defiant
Al-Araf,25,-0.9109,0.314,0.686,0.0,after them we sent moses with our sign to pharaoh and his chief but they willfully rejected them consider the end of the evil doer
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said pharaoh am messenger from the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,27,0.7134,0.044,0.756,0.2,duty bound to say nothing about god but the truth and have brought you clear sign from your lord let the child of israel go with me
Al-Araf,16,0.3182,0.0,0.867,0.133,pharaoh said if you come with sign then produce it if you are telling the truth
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then moses threw down his staff and suddenly unmistakably it appeared a serpent
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,and he drew forth his hand and it appeared shining white to the beholder
Al-Araf,12,0.4927,0.0,0.775,0.225,the chief of pharaoh people said this is most surely skillful magician
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who seek to drive you from your land pharaoh said what then do you advise
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said let him and his brother wait awhile and send into the city summoners
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who should bring to you every skillful magician
Al-Araf,16,0.5719,0.0,0.802,0.198,and the magician came to pharaoh and asked shall we have reward if we should prevail
Al-Araf,10,0.34,0.0,0.789,0.211,pharaoh replied certainly and you shall also become my courtier
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses will you first throw or shall we
Al-Araf,29,0.4767,0.06,0.816,0.124,he said you throw first when they made their cast they bewitched the eye of the people and struck them with awe for they showed great feat of magic
Al-Araf,17,0.4939,0.0,0.833,0.167,then we inspired moses saying throw down your staff and it immediately swallowed up their false device
Al-Araf,12,0.3182,0.0,0.827,0.173,thus the truth prevailed and what they had produced came to nothing
Al-Araf,9,-0.6997,0.453,0.547,0.0,pharaoh and his men were defeated and utterly humiliated
Al-Araf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the sorcerer prostrated themselves
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and said we believe in the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pharaoh said you dare believe in him before have given you permission behold this is indeed plot which you have devised in this city in order to drive it people out but you shall soon know the consequence
Al-Araf,15,0.2732,0.115,0.71,0.175,will cut off your hand and foot on alternate side and then crucify you all
Al-Araf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,they replied we shall surely return to our lord
Al-Araf,37,-0.8074,0.191,0.809,0.0,you would punish u only because we believed in the sign of our lord when they were shown to u our lord pour patience upon u and cause u to die in state of submission to you
Al-Araf,45,-0.4019,0.093,0.828,0.079,the chief of pharaoh people said will you allow moses and his people to spread corruption in the land and to forsake you and your god he replied we shall kill their male child and spare only the female we have complete power over them
Al-Araf,37,0.5106,0.083,0.716,0.201,moses said to his people turn to god for help and be patient the earth belongs to god he give it to those of his servant whom he chooses and the future belongs to the god fearing
Al-Araf,41,-0.8225,0.234,0.685,0.081,they replied we were being persecuted before you came to u and we are still being persecuted he said your lord may well destroy your enemy and make you successor to the land then he will see how you conduct yourselves
Al-Araf,16,-0.5423,0.243,0.757,0.0,we afflicted pharaoh people with shortage of food and famine so that they might take heed
Al-Araf,48,-0.8442,0.227,0.641,0.132,then when something good came to them they said it is our due but when something bad came they ascribed it a an ill omen to moses and those with him surely their evil fortune had been decreed by god but most of them did not know this
Al-Araf,15,0.5859,0.0,0.774,0.226,they said whatever miracle you work to bewitch u we will not believe in you
Al-Araf,31,-0.9024,0.318,0.634,0.047,then we afflicted them with storm and locust and louse and frog and blood so many clear sign but they were steeped in arrogance for they were people given to sin
Al-Araf,46,0.8658,0.038,0.721,0.241,whenever plague struck them they would say moses pray to your lord for u by virtue of the promise he ha made to you if you remove this plague from u we will surely believe in you and let the child of israel go with you
Al-Araf,21,0.872,0.0,0.645,0.355,but whenever we removed the plague from them giving them time to make good their promise they would break their word
Al-Araf,23,-0.8555,0.32,0.68,0.0,so we exacted retribution from them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected our sign and paid no heed to them
Al-Araf,57,0.7003,0.088,0.739,0.172,we made the people who were considered weak inheritor of the eastern part and western part of the land which we had blessed thus your lord good promise to the child of israel wa fulfilled because of their patience and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people had built and all that they had raised high
Al-Araf,41,0.743,0.045,0.753,0.202,we brought the child of israel across the sea and they came upon people who were devoted to their idol they said moses give u god just like the god these people have he said you are indeed an ignorant people
Al-Araf,16,-0.8402,0.421,0.472,0.106,what they are engaged in is doomed to destruction and all their work are in vain
Al-Araf,21,0.5423,0.0,0.809,0.191,he said shall seek deity for you other than god while it is he who ha exalted you above all people
Al-Araf,31,0.3818,0.137,0.685,0.178,we delivered you from pharaoh people who afflicted you with dreadful torment slaying your male child and sparing only your daughter that wa surely great trial for you by your lord
Al-Araf,46,0.4215,0.0,0.941,0.059,we appointed thirty night for moses then added ten more the term set by his lord wa fulfilled in forty night moses said to his brother aaron take my place among my people act rightly and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption
Al-Araf,90,0.2617,0.038,0.912,0.049,and when moses came at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show yourself to me so that may look at you he replied you cannot see me but look at the mountain if it remains firmly in it place then only will you see me and when his lord manifested himself on the mountain he broke it into piece and moses fell down unconscious and when he recovered he said glory be to you turn towards you and am the first to believe
Al-Araf,27,0.4588,0.0,0.897,0.103,he replied moses have chosen you of all mankind for my message and my word hold fast to what have given you and be among the grateful
Al-Araf,42,0.2023,0.071,0.84,0.088,and we wrote for him upon the tablet an admonition and detail of all thing then bade him hold fast to them and command your people to follow them in their best sense soon shall show you the home of the wicked
Al-Araf,74,-0.8151,0.106,0.894,0.0,will turn away from my sign all those who are arrogant in the land without any right so that even if they see all the sign they will not believe in them if they see the right path they shall not walk upon it but if they see the path of error they shall choose it for their path because they have given the lie to our sign and paid no heed to them
Al-Araf,27,-0.4404,0.1,0.9,0.0,the action of those who denied our sign and the meeting of the hereafter will come to nothing they shall be requited only according to their deed
Al-Araf,45,-0.5106,0.117,0.832,0.051,in his absence the people of moses made calf from their ornament an image which made lowing sound could they not see that it did not speak to them or guide them in any way yet they took to worshipping it they were evil doer
Al-Araf,34,-0.7105,0.236,0.708,0.055,when they were afflicted with remorse and realized that they had indeed gone astray they said if our lord doe not have mercy on u and forgive u we shall be among the lost
Al-Araf,78,-0.9166,0.223,0.673,0.104,when moses returned to his people in anger and great sorrow he said what an awful sin you have committed in my absence did you want to hasten your lord command he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the head pulling him towards himself aaron said son of my mother the people oppressed me and almost killed me do not give my enemy cause to gloat over me do not number me among the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,23,0.6597,0.0,0.748,0.252,he said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u to your mercy you are the most merciful of the merciful
Al-Araf,33,-0.4404,0.144,0.787,0.068,those who took to worshipping the calf will be afflicted by their lord wrath and be disgraced in the life of this world this is the way we requite those who invent falsehood
Al-Araf,19,-0.1027,0.18,0.615,0.205,a for those who committed evil and thereafter repented and believed they shall find your lord forgiving and merciful
Al-Araf,25,-0.6597,0.22,0.701,0.08,when his anger had subsided moses took up the tablet upon which wa inscribed pledge of guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,99,-0.0387,0.142,0.734,0.124,and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment when they were seized with violent quaking he prayed my lord if it had been your will you could have destroyed both them and me long ago but would you destroy u for the deed of the foolish one among u this is no more than your trial by it you cause whom you will to stray and you lead whom you will to the right path you are our protector forgive u therefore and have mercy on u for you are the best of those who forgive
Al-Araf,52,0.4118,0.093,0.784,0.124,grant u good thing both in this life and in the hereafter to you alone we turn he replied a for my punishment smite with it anyone will but my mercy encompasses all thing shall prescribe it for those who do their duty pay the zakat and who believe in our sign
Al-Araf,85,0.5106,0.115,0.739,0.147,also for those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet they find described in the torah that is with them and in the gospel who command them to do right and forbids them to do wrong who make good thing lawful to them and bad thing unlawful who will relieve them of their burden and of the shackle that weigh upon them those that believe in him and honour him those that aid him and follow the light sent down with him shall surely triumph
Al-Araf,54,0.3182,0.107,0.706,0.188,say people am god messenger to you all he ha sovereignty over the heaven and the earth there is no god but him he ordains life and death so believe in god and his messenger the unlettered prophet who belief in god and his word follow him so that you may be rightly guided
Al-Araf,20,0.3182,0.0,0.892,0.108,yet there is group among the people of moses who guide with truth and act justly in accordance with it
Al-Araf,80,0.2626,0.052,0.884,0.064,we divided them up into twelve tribe each whole community and we revealed our will to moses when his people asked for water saying strike the rock with your staff twelve spring gushed from it and each tribe knew it drinking place we caused the cloud to draw their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quail saying eat the good thing we have given you they did not wrong u rather it wa themselves they wronged

Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when joseph told his father my father saw eleven star and the sun and moon saw them prostrate themselves before me
Yusuf,25,-0.8638,0.305,0.695,0.0,he replied my son do not relate your dream to your brother lest they plot evil against you satan is the sworn enemy of man
Yusuf,61,0.8481,0.0,0.861,0.139,you shall be chosen by your lord and he will impart to you some understanding of the inner meaning of event he will bestow the full measure of his blessing upon you and upon the house of jacob even a he formerly bestowed it in full measure upon your forefather abraham and isaac truly your sustainer is all knowing and wise
Yusuf,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,surely in joseph and his brother there are sign for the inquirer
Yusuf,28,0.836,0.068,0.623,0.309,they said to each other surely joseph and his brother benjamin are dearer to our father than ourselves although we are band truly our father is clearly mistaken
Yusuf,33,-0.5994,0.115,0.885,0.0,therefore let u put joseph to death or cast him away to some far off land so that our father attention should turn only to u and you can thereafter become righteous people
Yusuf,29,0.6148,0.0,0.843,0.157,one of them said do not kill joseph but if you must do something cast him into the bottom of well some of the traveller will pick him up
Yusuf,19,-0.1536,0.13,0.769,0.101,they said to their father why do you not trust u with joseph we are indeed his well wishers
Yusuf,18,0.6808,0.0,0.728,0.272,send him with u tomorrow so that he may play and enjoy himself we will look after him
Yusuf,28,-0.7003,0.182,0.818,0.0,jacob said it would indeed grieve me if you took him away with you and fear lest the wolf should devour him while you are off your guard
Yusuf,19,0.8625,0.112,0.461,0.428,they said surely if the wolf devoured him while we were strong party we should indeed be great loser
Yusuf,45,0.2732,0.0,0.954,0.046,and so when they went away with him they decided to cast him into the dark depth of well then we revealed to him our will you shall one day tell them of this deed of theirs when they do not realize who you are
Yusuf,9,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,and at nightfall they came to their father weeping
Yusuf,31,0.4497,0.0,0.908,0.092,they said father we went off racing and left joseph with our belonging and the wolf devoured him but you will not believe u even though we are telling the truth
Yusuf,41,0.5346,0.204,0.584,0.212,and they showed him their brother shirt stained with false blood no he cried your soul have tempted you to do something evil but it is best to be patient god alone can help me bear the loss you speak of
Yusuf,50,0.8338,0.021,0.764,0.214,and there came caravan of traveller and they sent their water drawer to draw water from the well he let down his bucket into the well and he exclaimed oh what lucky find here is boy they hid him like piece of merchandise but god knew well what they did
Yusuf,18,0.2815,0.0,0.888,0.112,later they sold him for paltry sum few piece of silver dirham so little did they value him
Yusuf,59,0.875,0.0,0.812,0.188,the egyptian who bought him said to his wife lodge him honourably he may prove of benefit to u or we may even adopt him a our son thus we established joseph in the land so that we might teach him the true meaning of event god ha power over all thing however most people do not know this
Yusuf,20,0.7906,0.0,0.68,0.32,and when he reached maturity we bestowed on him right judgement and knowledge thus we reward those who do good
Yusuf,40,0.7579,0.049,0.743,0.208,however the woman in whose house he lived wanted to seduce him one day she bolted the door and said come he replied god forbid truly your husband is my master and ha treated me honourably wrongdoer certainly never prosper
Yusuf,42,-0.3612,0.093,0.846,0.061,she started towards him and he would have succumbed to her if he had not seen sign from his lord we did this in order to keep evil and indecency away from him for he wa truly one of our chosen servant
Yusuf,43,-0.9246,0.275,0.725,0.0,they both ran to the door and in the struggle she tore his shirt at the back they found her husband at the door she cried shall not the man who wished to violate your wife be thrown into prison or sternly punished
Yusuf,33,-0.4767,0.143,0.796,0.061,joseph said it wa she who sought to seduce me one of her household testified if his shirt is torn at the front then she is speaking the truth and he is lying
Yusuf,16,-0.631,0.308,0.564,0.128,but if it is torn from behind then she is lying and he speaks the truth
Yusuf,24,0.4767,0.071,0.783,0.146,so when he saw his shirt torn from behind her husband said this is the guile of you woman your guile is great indeed
Yusuf,16,-0.8126,0.366,0.526,0.107,joseph overlook this but you wife ask forgiveness for your sin for you have done wrong
Yusuf,29,0.2023,0.127,0.751,0.121,woman in the town began to gossip the nobleman wife is trying to seduce her slave love for him consumes her heart indeed we see her in manifest error
Yusuf,63,0.8719,0.065,0.719,0.216,when she heard of their intrigue she sent for them and prepared party for them she gave knife to each of them to cut fruit etc and then asked joseph to appear before them when the woman saw him they were greatly amazed at his beauty and they cut their hand exclaiming god preserve u this is no human being but noble angel
Yusuf,46,-0.7615,0.18,0.763,0.058,she said this is he about whom you have been blaming me and indeed did try to make him yield to me but he wa unyielding now however if he doe not do a bid him he shall certainly be put in prison and be humiliated
Yusuf,37,-0.3781,0.128,0.782,0.09,joseph said my lord would prefer prison to what these woman are inviting me to do and if you do not avert their guile from me may yield to them and so become one of the ignorant
Yusuf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord answered him and warded off their guile he is all hearing and all knowing
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,yet even after all the evidence they had seen they thought it right to jail him for time
Yusuf,52,0.1531,0.059,0.854,0.087,two young men entered the prison along with him one of them said saw myself in dream wa pressing wine the other said dreamed wa carrying bread on my head from which the bird were eating tell u their meaning for we see that you are one who doe good to all
Yusuf,50,0.048,0.077,0.842,0.081,joseph said to them shall inform you of the interpretation of your dream before your meal is brought to you this is part of the knowledge that my lord ha taught me have renounced the religion of the people who do not believe in god and who deny the hereafter
Yusuf,40,0.5454,0.058,0.777,0.165,follow the religion of my father abraham isaac and jacob and it is not for u to associate anyone with god a partner this is of god grace upon u and upon mankind even though most men are not grateful
Yusuf,15,0.128,0.171,0.585,0.244,my two fellow prisoner are many diverse lord better or god the one the almighty
Yusuf,52,0.8873,0.05,0.681,0.268,all those you worship instead of him are mere name you and your forefather have invented name for which god ha sent down no authority all power belongs to god alone and he order you to worship none but him this is the true faith though most people do not realize it
Yusuf,41,-0.25,0.078,0.844,0.078,my two fellow prisoner one of you will serve wine to his lord the other of you will be crucified and bird will feed off his head the matter about which you have been seeking my opinion ha been so decreed
Yusuf,36,-0.2732,0.126,0.775,0.099,he said to the one he thought would be saved mention me to your master however satan made him forget to mention him to his master and so joseph remained in prison for number of year
Yusuf,41,0.8176,0.0,0.796,0.204,the king said saw in dream seven fat cow which seven lean one were eating also seven green ear of corn and seven others which were dry tell me the meaning of this vision my noble if you can interpret vision
Yusuf,16,0.2732,0.101,0.688,0.212,they said these are confusing dream and we do not know the interpretation of such dream
Yusuf,32,-0.5423,0.13,0.87,0.0,then one of the two men who had been released and who after long time remembered said shall tell you it interpretation therefore give me leave to go to joseph in prison
Yusuf,46,0.6124,0.0,0.896,0.104,truthful joseph he said tell u the meaning of dream in which seven fat cow are being eaten by seven lean one and there are seven green ear of corn and seven others which are dry so that may return to my people and inform them
Yusuf,28,-0.0772,0.048,0.952,0.0,joseph said you shall sow for seven consecutive year a usual but leave in the ear the harvest that you reap except for little which you may eat
Yusuf,19,0.2263,0.078,0.802,0.12,then there will follow seven year of great hardship which will consume all but little of what you stored
Yusuf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then year will come after that when people will have abundant rain and when once more they will press wine and oil
Yusuf,37,0.4939,0.051,0.821,0.128,the king said bring him to me when the king messenger came to joseph he said go back to your master and ask him about the woman who cut their hand my lord know well their guile
Yusuf,56,0.6597,0.125,0.66,0.215,the king asked the woman what wa the truth of the affair in which you tried to seduce joseph the woman said god forbid we know no evil of him the wife of the nobleman said the truth ha now come to light it wa who tried to seduce him he is surely an honest man
Yusuf,27,0.6671,0.0,0.821,0.179,from this said joseph the nobleman should know that did not betray him in his absence and that god doe not guide the plotting of the treacherous
Yusuf,27,-0.2235,0.181,0.663,0.156,am not trying to absolve myself for man very soul incites him to evil unless my lord bestows his mercy indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
Yusuf,34,0.8591,0.0,0.734,0.266,the king said bring him to me will take him for my special service and when he had spoken to him he said from now on you will dwell with u honoured and trusted

Yusuf,43,0.2584,0.141,0.661,0.198,thus we caused joseph to be established in position of authority in the land he could dwell therein wherever he pleased we bestow our mercy on whomever we please and we do not allow the reward of the righteous to go to waste
Yusuf,17,0.875,0.0,0.583,0.417,yet the reward of the hereafter is best for those who believe and are mindful of god
Yusuf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,joseph brother arrived and presented themselves before him he recognized them but they did not know him

Yusuf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,joseph said to his servant put their money back into their saddlebag so that they will recognize it when they return home to their family thus they may come back
Yusuf,42,0.1531,0.065,0.833,0.101,when they returned to their father they said our father any further measure of grain ha been denied u so send our brother benjamin along with u so that we may obtain our measure of grain and we shall guard him well

Yusuf,28,0.3252,0.0,0.92,0.08,when they presented themselves before joseph he took his brother benjamin aside he said am your brother so do not feel distressed about whatever they have been doing
Yusuf,30,0.2732,0.0,0.932,0.068,and when he had given them their provision he placed drinking cup in his brother pack then crier called out after them men of the caravan you have committed theft

Yusuf,20,-0.7506,0.262,0.738,0.0,the egyptian asked them and if we find that you are lying what penalty shall we mete out to you
Yusuf,31,-0.872,0.268,0.732,0.0,they replied the penalty should be that he in whose saddlebag it is found should be held a bondman to atone for the crime that is how we punish the wrongdoer
Yusuf,60,0.427,0.0,0.922,0.078,he the herald searched their bag before his brother and then took out the cup from his brother bag in this way we devised plan on behalf of joseph he could not have detained his brother under the king law unless god so willed we exalt whoever we please but above those who have knowledge there is one all knowing
Yusuf,41,0.5647,0.121,0.688,0.191,they said if he is thief brother of his had also committed theft before him but joseph kept his secret and revealed nothing to them he said to himself your deed wa worse god best know the thing you speak of

Yusuf,25,0.2732,0.147,0.639,0.214,he said no blame shall fall on you this day may god forgive you and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
Yusuf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,go with this shirt of mine and cast it upon my father face he will recover his sight thereupon come back to me with all your family
Yusuf,24,0.4767,0.0,0.881,0.119,when the caravan set out from egypt their father in canaan said you may think am senile but certainly perceive the breath of joseph
Yusuf,10,0.2732,0.0,0.811,0.189,they said by god you still persist in your illusion

Yusuf,23,0.7845,0.0,0.717,0.283,then when they presented themselves before joseph he drew his parent to him and said welcome to egypt in safety if god will
Yusuf,81,0.93,0.061,0.729,0.211,he helped his parent to couch and they all fell down on their knee before him he said my father this is the interpretation of my dream my lord ha made it come true he wa kind to me when he let me out of prison and brought you from the desert after satan had brought about discord between me and my brother my lord is the best planner in achieving what he will he is all knowing and truly wise
Yusuf,47,0.296,0.072,0.796,0.131,then joseph prayed my lord you have given me power and taught me the interpretation of dream creator of the heaven and the earth you are my patron in this world and the hereafter make me die in submission to you and admit me among the righteous
Yusuf,26,0.2732,0.0,0.923,0.077,these are tidings of the unseen that we reveal to you prophet though you were not present with them when they plotted and agreed upon plan
Yusuf,14,0.5405,0.0,0.667,0.333,yet most men will not become believer no matter how eager you may be
Yusuf,17,0.3291,0.0,0.872,0.128,you shall not ask them for any reward for this it is but reminder for all mankind

Al-Kahf,29,-0.2263,0.159,0.737,0.105,and which rightly directs to give warning of stern punishment from him and to proclaim to the believer who do righteous deed that they shall have an excellent recompense
Al-Kahf,9,0.5719,0.0,0.684,0.316,wherein they will remain in state of bliss forever
Al-Kahf,12,0.4767,0.094,0.604,0.302,and to warn those who say god ha taken to himself son
Al-Kahf,23,-0.296,0.091,0.909,0.0,they have no knowledge of this nor did their forefather have any either what they say is monstrous they are merely uttering falsehood
Al-Kahf,15,-0.7717,0.34,0.66,0.0,perhaps you may destroy yourself with grief if they do not believe in this message
Al-Kahf,22,0.836,0.0,0.669,0.331,we have adorned the earth with attractive thing so that we may test mankind a to which one is best in conduct

Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do you think that the men of the cave and the inscription were one of our wondrous sign
Al-Kahf,26,0.7717,0.0,0.732,0.268,when the young men sought refuge in the cave they said our lord grant u your special mercy and give u right guidance in our affair
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we caused them to fall into deep sleep for many year inside the cave
Al-Kahf,25,0.4404,0.0,0.892,0.108,then we woke them up again so that we might see which of the two group would better calculate the time they had stayed there
Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we shall tell you their story a it really wa they were young men who believed in their lord and on whom we bestowed further guidance
Al-Kahf,40,0.4767,0.065,0.803,0.132,we strengthened their heart when they rose up and declared our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth never shall we call upon any deity other than him for that would be an outrageous thing to do
Al-Kahf,31,-0.5827,0.163,0.778,0.058,these people of ours have taken deity other than him why do they not produce clear evidence about them who is more wicked than the man who invents falsehood against god
Al-Kahf,39,0.7579,0.0,0.805,0.195,now that you have withdrawn from them and from all that they worship instead of god take refuge in that cave your lord will extend his mercy to you and will make fitting provision for you in your situation
Al-Kahf,69,0.34,0.038,0.877,0.085,the sun could be observed to incline away from their cave on the right a it rose and to turn away from them on the left when it set while they lay in the wide space inside the cave this is one of the sign of god he whom god guide is rightly guided but for him whom he let go astray you will find no helper or guide
Al-Kahf,50,-0.128,0.063,0.884,0.053,you would have thought they were awake though they lay asleep we turned them over to the right and the left while their dog lay at the cave entrance with leg outstretched had you looked down and seen them you would have surely turned your back and fled in terror
Al-Kahf,93,0.7783,0.0,0.941,0.059,in the course of time we raised them up again so that they might question one another one of them asked how long have you stayed here they said we have stayed day or part of day but others said your lord know best how long you have stayed here let one of you go then with these silver coin to the town and let him find out what food is purest there and bring you back supply of it let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone
Al-Kahf,26,-0.2732,0.127,0.782,0.091,for if they find you out they will stone you to death or force you back into their faith in that case you would never prosper
Al-Kahf,61,0.8519,0.096,0.683,0.221,thus we disclosed thing to them so that they might know that god promise wa true and there wa no doubt about the hour judgement day the people argued about them among themselves they said build monument over them their lord know best concerning them those who prevailed in their affair said let u surely build place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,68,0.6705,0.0,0.923,0.077,some will say they were three the fourth wa their dog and others will say they were five the sixth wa their dog guessing at random and yet others say they were seven the eighth wa their dog say my lord know best their number only few know anything about them therefore do not enter into controversy over them nor seek information about them from any of them

Al-Kahf,63,-0.7506,0.166,0.742,0.092,say this is the truth from your lord let him who will believe in it and him who will deny it for the wrongdoer we have prepared fire which will cover them like canopy and if they beg for water they will be given water a hot a molten lead which will scald their face how dreadful drink and how evil resting place
Al-Kahf,24,0.0005,0.189,0.621,0.19,a for those who believe and do good deed we do not let the reward of anyone who doe good deed go to waste
Al-Kahf,45,0.9349,0.0,0.707,0.293,they shall dwell in the garden of eternity where river flow at their foot reclining upon raised couch they will be adorned with bracelet of gold and will wear green robe of fine silk and heavy brocade an excellent reward and an excellent resting place

Al-Kahf,25,0.7935,0.0,0.765,0.235,each garden produced it fruit and did not fail to yield it best we even caused river to gush forth in the midst of them
Al-Kahf,23,0.4939,0.0,0.873,0.127,and so he had fruit in abundance while conversing with his companion he said am wealthier than you are and have bigger following
Al-Kahf,18,-0.4767,0.154,0.846,0.0,having thus harmed his own soul he entered his garden saying do not think this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,24,0.7003,0.0,0.791,0.209,and do not believe that the hour will ever come even if am returned to my lord shall surely find better place than this
Al-Kahf,28,-0.3612,0.143,0.794,0.063,his companion replied in the course of their discussion do you deny him who created you from dust from small drop of fluid then formed you into man
Al-Kahf,18,-0.3919,0.253,0.621,0.126,but a far a am concerned god alone is my lord and set up no partner with him
Al-Kahf,36,0.8834,0.048,0.656,0.295,when you entered your garden why did you not say that which god will will surely come to pas there is no power save with god although you see have le wealth and offspring than you

Al-Kahf,24,0.9738,0.0,0.394,0.606,the only support is from god the true god he is the best in rewarding and the best in respect of the final outcome
Al-Kahf,46,0.7184,0.0,0.86,0.14,give them an example about worldly life it is like the vegetation of the earth that thrives when watered by the rain which we send down from the sky and then it all becomes stubble which the wind blow away god ha power over all thing
Al-Kahf,29,0.9707,0.0,0.515,0.485,wealth and child are an ornament of the life of this world but deed of lasting merit are better rewarded by your lord and far better source of hope
Al-Kahf,32,0.0382,0.0,0.964,0.036,the day we shall make the mountain move and you will see the earth laid bare and we shall gather all mankind together and shall not leave any one of them behind

Al-Kahf,23,-0.3048,0.123,0.8,0.076,we have explained in various way in this quran for the benefit of mankind all kind of example but man is most contentious
Al-Kahf,41,-0.5942,0.12,0.845,0.034,nothing prevents people from believing when they are given guidance or from asking forgiveness of their lord but the fact that the fate of the previous people should befall them or to have the punishment come upon them face to face
Al-Kahf,31,-0.5423,0.249,0.617,0.134,we only send the messenger to bring good news and to give warning those who deny use fallacious argument to nullify the truth treating my revelation and my warning a jest
Al-Kahf,61,0.1298,0.076,0.84,0.084,who is more wicked than he who ha been reminded of the revelation of his lord then turn away from them and forgets what his own hand have done we have cast veil over their heart lest they understand our word and made them hard of hearing call them a you may to the right path they shall never be guided
Al-Kahf,44,-0.34,0.159,0.709,0.132,your lord is the forgiving one the possessor of mercy if he had to take them to task for the wrong they have done he would have hastened their punishment they have an appointed time beyond which there will be no escape for them
Al-Kahf,17,-0.875,0.417,0.583,0.0,we destroyed these community when they went on doing wrong and we appointed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,25,0.0258,0.0,0.956,0.044,recall how moses said to his servant shall not give up until reach the place where both sea meet even if it take me year
Al-Kahf,27,0.4215,0.0,0.903,0.097,but when at last they came to the land where the two sea met they forgot their fish and it swiftly made it way into the sea
Al-Kahf,25,-0.34,0.094,0.906,0.0,after they had passed the place moses said to his young companion bring u our morning meal we have indeed been fatigued by this journey
Al-Kahf,36,-0.2263,0.051,0.949,0.0,he replied did you see when we were resting by the rock that forgot the fish satan made me forget it so did not mention it it made it way to the sea in miraculous way
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said that is just what we were looking for so they went back the way they had come
Al-Kahf,20,0.5423,0.0,0.8,0.2,and they found one of our servant to whom we had granted our mercy and had given knowledge from ourself
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said to him may follow you so that you may guide me by what you have been taught
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he replied you will not be able to bear with me patiently
Al-Kahf,10,0.0258,0.0,0.891,0.109,how could you be patient in matter beyond your knowledge
Al-Kahf,17,0.2732,0.0,0.884,0.116,moses said god willing you will find me patient and will not disobey you in any thing
Al-Kahf,21,0.2732,0.0,0.905,0.095,he said well then if you would follow me do not ask me about anything till speak of it to you
Al-Kahf,37,-0.872,0.203,0.797,0.0,so they set out but when they got into boat the man made hole in it moses exclaimed have you made hole in the boat to drown the people in it you have indeed done dreadful thing
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he replied did not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently
Al-Kahf,25,-0.1541,0.073,0.878,0.049,he said do not take me to task for what have forgotten and do not be hard on me on account of what have done
Al-Kahf,33,-0.7351,0.19,0.75,0.06,so they travelled on then they met young boy and the man killed him moses said have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone indeed you have done terrible thing
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the man said did not tell you that you would not be able to have any patience with me
Al-Kahf,22,0.0772,0.0,0.942,0.058,moses replied if ever ask you about anything after this do not let me accompany you will have given you sufficient excuse
Al-Kahf,49,-0.631,0.099,0.901,0.0,so they went on until they came to town they asked it people for food but were refused hospitality they found wall in the town which wa about to fall down his companion buttressed it and moses said had you wished you could have demanded payment for your labour
Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he answered this is where you and must part company but first will tell you the meaning of the thing you could not bear with patiently
Al-Kahf,32,-0.743,0.174,0.826,0.0,the boat belonged to some poor people who made their living from the sea wanted to damage it because there wa king coming behind them who wa seizing every boat by force
Al-Kahf,22,-0.6249,0.277,0.637,0.086,a for the youth his parent were believer and we feared that he would trouble them by rebellion and denial of truth
Al-Kahf,15,0.5413,0.0,0.8,0.2,we wanted their lord to replace him with someone purer than him and more compassionate
Al-Kahf,67,0.7096,0.0,0.901,0.099,the wall belonged to two young orphan in the town whose father had been righteous man and treasure of theirs lay underneath it so your lord wanted them to come of age and then to dig up their treasure a mercy from him did not do it of my own accord that is the explanation of the thing about which you were not able to restrain yourself
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will ask you about dhu qarnayn say will give you an account of him
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we established him in the land and gave him the mean to achieve all thing
Al-Kahf,5,0.2732,0.0,0.656,0.344,he travelled on certain road
Al-Kahf,42,-0.0772,0.073,0.839,0.088,until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in spring of murky water and near it he found some people we said dhu qarnayn you can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness
Al-Kahf,26,-0.9287,0.418,0.519,0.062,he said we shall certainly punish him who doe wrong then he shall be brought back to his lord who will punish him with grievous punishment
Al-Kahf,20,0.9313,0.0,0.535,0.465,but whoever belief and doe good work shall have good reward and we shall facilitate his matter by our command
Al-Kahf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed yet another path
Al-Kahf,26,-0.296,0.081,0.919,0.0,until he came to the rising place of the sun where he found it rising on people for whom we had provided no shelter from it
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus indeed it wa we had full knowledge of him
Al-Kahf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed still another path
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,until he came between two mountain he found beside them people who could scarcely understand word of his language
Al-Kahf,29,-0.2878,0.108,0.892,0.0,they said dhu qarnayn gog and magog are causing corruption in the land so may we pay you tribute on condition that you set barrier between u and them
Al-Kahf,27,0.7579,0.046,0.708,0.246,he said what my lord ha given me is better than any tribute help me with force of labourer and will erect barrier between you and them
Al-Kahf,44,-0.802,0.167,0.833,0.0,bring me block of iron then when he had filled the gap between the mountain side he said now blow on the fire with your bellow when the iron block were red with heat he said bring me molten brass to pour on them
Al-Kahf,19,-0.25,0.1,0.9,0.0,so they gog and magog were not able to scale it nor were they able to bore through it
Al-Kahf,31,0.8847,0.0,0.704,0.296,and he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord come to pas he will level it to dust my lord promise is ever true
Al-Kahf,27,0.3612,0.0,0.912,0.088,on that day we shall let them surge against each other like wave and then the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them all together
Al-Kahf,14,-0.6908,0.345,0.542,0.113,on that day we shall lay hell bare before those who deny the truth

Al-Kahf,14,-0.4019,0.172,0.828,0.0,say shall tell you of those who will lose the most through their action
Al-Kahf,21,-0.0772,0.127,0.757,0.116,they are those whose effort have been wasted in the life of the world while they thought they were doing good
Al-Kahf,31,-0.7506,0.209,0.791,0.0,they are those who deny their lord sign and the meeting with him so their work are in vain and we shall give them no weight on the day of resurrection
Al-Kahf,19,-0.3612,0.263,0.526,0.211,hell will be their reward because they denied the truth and made jest of my sign and my messenger
Al-Kahf,16,0.7964,0.0,0.664,0.336,those who believe and do good work shall have the garden of paradise for their abode

As-Saaffaat,11,-0.4019,0.255,0.604,0.141,he will say by god you almost brought me to ruin
As-Saaffaat,18,-0.34,0.193,0.672,0.134,if it had not been for the blessing of my lord would also have been taken to hell
As-Saaffaat,14,0.7933,0.0,0.63,0.37,then he will say to his blessed companion are we not going to die
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.7845,0.408,0.592,0.0,except for our first death are we not going to be punished
As-Saaffaat,5,0.7906,0.0,0.3,0.7,truly this is great victory

As-Saaffaat,7,-0.4019,0.368,0.4,0.232,then surely they shall return to hell
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they found their father had gone astray
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they are rushing to follow in their footstep
As-Saaffaat,10,0.3818,0.0,0.776,0.224,and assuredly many of the ancient went astray before them
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,though we had sent warner among them
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.2732,0.208,0.792,0.0,see how those who were warned met their end
As-Saaffaat,7,0.2732,0.0,0.741,0.259,not so the chosen servant of god

As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he came to his lord with sound heart
As-Saaffaat,16,0.296,0.0,0.872,0.128,behold he said to his father and to his people what are these that you worship
As-Saaffaat,8,0.2732,0.0,0.769,0.231,would you serve false deity instead of god
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what do you think of the lord of the world
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he looked up at the star
As-Saaffaat,4,-0.5106,0.524,0.476,0.0,and said am sick
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they turned their back on him and went off
As-Saaffaat,11,0.2732,0.0,0.826,0.174,he turned to their god and said do you not eat
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0258,0.0,0.901,0.099,what is the matter with you that you do not speak
As-Saaffaat,12,0.4939,0.0,0.775,0.225,then he turned on them striking them down with his right hand
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,his people came rushing towards him
As-Saaffaat,14,0.7964,0.0,0.628,0.372,but he said how can you worship thing you carve with your own hand
As-Saaffaat,12,0.6705,0.0,0.581,0.419,when it is god who ha created you and all your handiwork
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said build pyre for him and throw him into the blaze
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.6542,0.401,0.599,0.0,they wanted to harm him but we humiliated them all
As-Saaffaat,13,0.3182,0.0,0.839,0.161,he said will go to my lord he is sure to guide me
As-Saaffaat,5,0.3612,0.0,0.615,0.385,lord grant me righteous son
As-Saaffaat,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,we gave him the good news that he would have patient forbearing son
As-Saaffaat,49,0.6705,0.0,0.854,0.146,and when he reached the age when he could work with him he said my son have seen in dream that am sacrificing you so tell me what you think of it he replied my father do a you are commanded and god willing you will find me steadfast
As-Saaffaat,17,0.2732,0.0,0.884,0.116,when they had both submitted to god and he had laid his son down on his face
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we called out to him abraham
As-Saaffaat,16,0.886,0.0,0.513,0.487,you have fulfilled the dream it is thus indeed that we reward those who do good
As-Saaffaat,5,0.4404,0.0,0.58,0.42,that surely wa manifest trial

As-Saaffaat,14,0.4215,0.0,0.823,0.177,and left him thus to be succeeded by group of follower among later generation
As-Saaffaat,5,0.5423,0.0,0.533,0.467,peace and salutation to abraham
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is how we recompense the righteous

As-Saaffaat,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,we gave abraham the good news of isaac prophet and righteous man
As-Saaffaat,19,0.7876,0.0,0.668,0.332,and blessed him and isaac too some of their offspring were good but some clearly sinned against their soul
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,we also bestowed our favour on moses and aaron

As-Saaffaat,7,0.2263,0.0,0.759,0.241,and guided them to the straight path
As-Saaffaat,15,0.4215,0.0,0.833,0.167,and we left them thus to be succeeded by group of follower among later generation

As-Saaffaat,6,0.2732,0.0,0.704,0.296,except the chosen servant of god
As-Saaffaat,15,0.4215,0.0,0.833,0.167,we left him thus to be succeeded by group of follower among the following generation
As-Saaffaat,7,0.5423,0.0,0.632,0.368,peace be on elijah and his people

As-Saaffaat,23,0.34,0.0,0.902,0.098,they claim that he ha kinship with the jinni yet the jinni themselves know that they will be produced before him for judgement

Al-Ahqaaf,43,0.1531,0.094,0.799,0.107,those who deny the truth say of the believer if there were any good in this quran they would not have believed in it before we did and since they refuse to be guided by it they say this is an ancient fabrication
Al-Ahqaaf,40,0.5574,0.091,0.723,0.186,yet the scripture of moses wa revealed before it a guide and blessing and this is book in the arabic language fulfilling previous prophecy to forewarn those who do evil and to bring good news to those who do good

Al-Ahqaaf,66,-0.1901,0.213,0.562,0.226,but he who say to his parent shame upon you do you threaten me with being taken out of the grave after death while many generation ha passed away before me and none ha risen from among them the parent both cry for god help and say to him believe ala for you god promise is true but he say these are nothing but ancient fable
Al-Ahqaaf,30,0.7003,0.09,0.638,0.271,it is against such a these that the word of god ha proved true along with all the community that went before them jinns and human surely they are loser
Al-Ahqaaf,23,0.3412,0.0,0.901,0.099,all will be ranked according to their deed we will requite them in full for their action and they will not be wronged
Al-Ahqaaf,60,-0.7717,0.214,0.674,0.112,on the day when those who deny the truth are brought before the fire it will be said to them you have had the good thing of the life of this world and you enjoyed them now this day you shall be requited with humiliating punishment because you were arrogant in the land without justification and because you acted rebelliously
Al-Ahqaaf,41,-0.9576,0.354,0.617,0.029,tell of the brother of ad when he warned his people in the sand dune and indeed warner came and went before him and after him saying worship none but god surely fear for you the punishment of an awful day
Al-Ahqaaf,29,0.1531,0.112,0.757,0.132,but they said have you come to u to turn u away from our deity then bring down upon u what you threaten u with if you are truthful
Al-Ahqaaf,27,-0.3818,0.14,0.808,0.052,he said god alone know when it will come and deliver to you the message with which am sent but see you are people who are ignorant
Al-Ahqaaf,47,-0.8735,0.199,0.764,0.036,so when they saw it in the shape of dense cloud approaching their valley they exclaimed this is only heavy cloud which will bring u welcome rain but hud said by no mean it is the very thing which you sought to hasten wind bearing grievous suffering
Al-Ahqaaf,29,-0.7506,0.255,0.632,0.113,which will destroy everything at it lord behest and in the morning there wa nothing left to be seen save their empty dwelling thus we repay the evil doer
Al-Ahqaaf,67,0.0441,0.055,0.861,0.084,we had empowered them to an extent which we have not empowered you people of later time and we had endowed them with hearing and sight and heart but neither their hearing nor their sight nor their heart were of the least avail to them since they went on rejecting god revelation and they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride
Al-Ahqaaf,26,-0.4939,0.113,0.887,0.0,we have also destroyed other town that once flourished around you we had given them various sign so that they might return to the right path
Al-Ahqaaf,37,-0.3523,0.176,0.681,0.143,so why did their god not help them those they set up a god besides god to bring them nearer to him no indeed they failed them utterly it wa all lie fabrication of their own making
Al-Ahqaaf,47,-0.34,0.051,0.949,0.0,remember how we sent to you band of jinni who wished to hear the quran and a they listened to it recitation they said to one another be silent and listen and then when it wa finished they went back to their people to give them warning
Al-Ahqaaf,32,0.5719,0.0,0.865,0.135,they said our people we have heard book which ha been sent down after moses fulfilling the prediction existing in previous scripture it guide to the truth and to the right path
Al-Ahqaaf,26,-0.4215,0.258,0.505,0.237,our people respond to the one who call you to god believe in him god will forgive you your sin and protect you from painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,30,0.3246,0.066,0.829,0.105,but he who doe not respond to god call can never elude him on earth nor can he have any protector against him such people have clearly gone far astray
Al-Ahqaaf,38,0.7774,0.12,0.588,0.292,have they not seen that god who created the heaven and the earth and wa not wearied by their creation ha the power to bring the dead back to life yes indeed he ha power over all thing
Al-Ahqaaf,45,0.1531,0.144,0.683,0.173,on the day when those who deny the truth will be brought before the fire they shall be asked is this not the truth they will reply yes by our lord he will say then taste the punishment because of your denial of the truth
Al-Ahqaaf,60,-0.7506,0.125,0.852,0.024,have patience then a had the steadfast messenger before you and be in no haste about them on the day when they see what they are threatened with it will appear to them a though they had not tarried longer than an hour of day your responsibility is to deliver the message and none but the disobedient shall be destroyed
Muhammad,26,0.7184,0.073,0.64,0.287,god will bring to naught all the good deed of those who are bent on denying the truth and bar others from the path of god
Muhammad,38,0.6249,0.079,0.706,0.214,a for those who believe and do good deed and believe in what ha been revealed to muhammad and it is the truth from their lord god will remove their sin from them and set their condition right
Muhammad,28,0.5106,0.073,0.725,0.202,that is because the one who deny the truth follow falsehood while those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus god set forth comparison for mankind
Muhammad,93,-0.872,0.193,0.685,0.122,when you meet those who deny the truth in battle strike them in the neck and once they are defeated make them prisoner and afterwards either set them free a an act of grace or let them ransom themselves until the war is finally over thus you shall do and if god had pleased he would certainly have exacted retribution from them but his purpose is to test some of you by mean of others a for those who are killed in god cause he will never let their deed be in vain
Muhammad,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,he will guide them and improve their condition
Muhammad,14,0.4939,0.0,0.741,0.259,he will admit them into the garden he ha already made known to them
Muhammad,14,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,believer if you succour god he will succour you and make your footstep firm
Muhammad,25,-0.5499,0.241,0.593,0.166,but a for those who are bent on denying the truth destruction will be their lot and god will make their deed come to nothing
Muhammad,18,0.4588,0.122,0.588,0.29,it is because they are averse to what god ha revealed that he ha rendered their deed futile
Muhammad,27,-0.1621,0.167,0.655,0.178,have they not travelled the earth and seen how those before them met their end god destroyed them utterly similar fate awaits those who deny the truth
Muhammad,21,-0.0516,0.177,0.654,0.169,that is because god is the protector of the believer and those who deny the truth have no protector at all
Muhammad,43,0.2732,0.099,0.719,0.183,god will admit those who believe and do good deed to garden through which river flow those who deny the truth may take their fill of pleasure in this world and eat a cattle do but the fire will be their ultimate abode
Muhammad,25,0.6597,0.153,0.54,0.307,how many town we have destroyed greater in strength than your city which ha driven you out and there wa no one to help them
Muhammad,35,0.7096,0.096,0.656,0.247,can then he who take his stand on clear evidence from his god be likened to those for whom the evil that they do is made to look beautiful and who follow their own desire
Muhammad,89,0.9382,0.023,0.802,0.175,here is description of the garden promised to the righteous therein are river of water which is forever pure and river of milk of which the taste never change and river of wine delight to those who drink it and river of pure honey and in it they will have all kind of fruit and will receive forgiveness from their lord can those who enjoy such bliss be like those who abide in the fire and who are given boiling water to drink so that it tear their bowel
Muhammad,45,0.8402,0.025,0.795,0.18,among them are those who listen to you but then when they leave your presence say to those who have been given knowledge scripture what wa that he just said such are those whose heart god ha sealed and who follow their own base desire
