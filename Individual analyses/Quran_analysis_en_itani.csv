Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the notable among pharaoh people said this is really skilled magician

Al-Araf,22,-0.4404,0.121,0.879,0.0,he said you throw and when they threw they beguiled the eye of the people and intimidated them and produced mighty magic
Al-Araf,16,0.1027,0.14,0.7,0.16,and we inspired moses throw your staff and at once it swallowed what they were faking
Al-Araf,14,0.3774,0.0,0.834,0.166,so the truth came to pas and what they were producing came to nothing
Al-Araf,7,-0.4767,0.341,0.659,0.0,there they were defeated and utterly reduced
Al-Araf,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician fell to their knee

Al-Araf,41,-0.743,0.156,0.8,0.044,the chief of pharaoh people said will you let moses and his people cause trouble in the land and forsake you and your god he said we will kill their son and spare their woman we have absolute power over them
Al-Araf,36,0.7096,0.0,0.827,0.173,moses said to his people seek help in god and be patient the earth belongs to god he give it in inheritance to whomever he will of his servant and the future belongs to the righteous
Al-Araf,39,-0.8126,0.21,0.747,0.043,they said we were persecuted before you came to u and after you came to u he said perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and make you successor in the land then he will see how you behave
Al-Araf,20,-0.5423,0.2,0.8,0.0,and we afflicted the people of pharaoh with barren year and with shortage of crop that they may take heed
Al-Araf,43,-0.3506,0.104,0.822,0.074,when something good came their way they said this is ours and when something bad happened to them they ascribed the evil omen to moses and those with him in fact their omen is with god but most of them do not know
Al-Araf,20,-0.2732,0.114,0.829,0.057,and they said no matter what sign you bring u to bewitch u with we will not believe in you
Al-Araf,31,-0.915,0.321,0.679,0.0,so we let loose upon them the flood and the locust and the louse and the frog and blood all explicit sign but they were too arrogant they were sinful people
Al-Araf,43,0.3182,0.0,0.946,0.054,whenever plague befell them they would say moses pray to your lord for u according to the covenant he made with you if you lift the plague from u we will believe in you and let the child of israel go with you
Al-Araf,18,0.4767,0.145,0.588,0.267,but when we lifted the plague from them for term they were to fulfill they broke their promise
Al-Araf,23,-0.8555,0.32,0.68,0.0,so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected our sign and paid no heed to them
Al-Araf,52,0.6124,0.099,0.723,0.178,and we made the oppressed people inherit the eastern and western part of the land which we had blessed thus the fair promise of your lord to the child of israel wa fulfilled because of their endurance and we destroyed what pharaoh and his people had built and what they had harvested
Al-Araf,43,0.7717,0.044,0.752,0.205,and we delivered the child of israel across the sea and when they came upon people who were devoted to some statue of theirs they said moses make for u god a they have god he said you are truly an ignorant people

Al-Araf,49,-0.3612,0.05,0.95,0.0,and we appointed to moses thirty night and completed them with ten and thus the time appointed by his lord wa forty night and moses said to his brother aaron take my place among my people and be upright and do not follow the way of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,85,0.7351,0.0,0.93,0.07,and when moses came to our appointment and his lord spoke to him he said my lord allow me to look and see you he said you will not see me but look at the mountain if it stay in it place you will see me but when his lord manifested himself to the mountain he turned it into dust and moses fell down unconscious then when he recovered he said glory be to you repent to you and am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,28,0.5719,0.0,0.879,0.121,he said moses have chosen you over all people for my message and for my word so take what have given you and be one of the thankful
Al-Araf,40,0.7783,0.0,0.826,0.174,and we inscribed for him in the tablet all kind of enlightenment and decisive explanation of all thing hold fast to them and exhort your people to adopt the best of them will show you the fate of the sinner
Al-Araf,68,-0.6412,0.142,0.811,0.047,will turn away from my revelation those who behave proudly on earth without justification even if they see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the path of rectitude they will not adopt it for path and if they see the path of error they will adopt it for path that is because they denied our revelation and paid no attention to them

Al-Araf,43,-0.4019,0.104,0.849,0.047,in his absence the people of moses adopted calf made from their ornament body which lowed did they not see that it could not speak to them nor guide them in any way they took it for worship they were in the wrong
Al-Araf,29,-0.0772,0.173,0.634,0.193,then when they regretted and realized that they had erred they said unless our lord extends his mercy to u and forgives u we will be among the loser
Al-Araf,85,-0.9475,0.193,0.779,0.028,and when moses returned to his people angry and disappointed he said what an awful thing you did in my absence did you forsake the commandment of your lord so hastily and he threw down the tablet and he took hold of his brother head dragging him towards himself he said son of my mother the people have overpowered me and were about to kill me so do not allow the enemy to gloat over me and do not count me among the unjust people
Al-Araf,24,0.6597,0.0,0.758,0.242,he said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful

Yusuf,15,0.872,0.0,0.594,0.406,but the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and observed piety
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and joseph brother came and entered into his presence he recognized them but they did not recognize him
Yusuf,32,0.6369,0.0,0.881,0.119,when he provided them with their provision he said bring me brother of yours from your father do you not see that fill up the measure and am the best of host

Yusuf,28,0.4404,0.0,0.903,0.097,he said to his servant put their good in their saddlebag perhaps they will recognize them when they return to their family and maybe they will come back

Yusuf,48,0.1406,0.0,0.967,0.033,and when they entered a their father had instructed them it did not avail them anything against god it wa just need in the soul of jacob which he carried out he wa person of knowledge inasmuch a we had taught him but most people do not know
Yusuf,28,0.4168,0.0,0.907,0.093,and when they entered into the presence of joseph he embraced his brother and said am your brother do not be saddened by what they used to do
Yusuf,29,-0.5267,0.108,0.892,0.0,then when he provided them with their provision he placed the drinking cup in his brother saddlebag then an announcer called out people of the caravan you are thief
Yusuf,11,-0.296,0.196,0.804,0.0,they said a they came towards them what are you missing
Yusuf,19,-0.0516,0.104,0.802,0.094,they said we are missing the king goblet whoever brings it will have camel load and personally guarantee it

Yusuf,11,-0.765,0.423,0.577,0.0,they said what shall be his punishment if you are lying
Yusuf,21,-0.7184,0.24,0.76,0.0,they said his punishment if it is found in his bag he will belong to you thus we penalize the guilty
Yusuf,58,0.52,0.0,0.928,0.072,so he began with their bag before his brother bag then he pulled it out of his brother bag thus we devised plan for joseph he could not have detained his brother under the king law unless god so willed we elevate by degree whomever we will and above every person of knowledge there is one more learned
Yusuf,40,-0.5106,0.173,0.702,0.125,they said if he ha stolen brother of his ha stolen before but joseph kept it to himself and did not reveal it to them he said you are in worse situation and god is aware of what you allege

Yusuf,56,0.1401,0.105,0.751,0.143,and when they despaired of him they conferred privately their eldest said don you know that your father received pledge from you before god and in the past you failed with regard to joseph will not leave this land until my father permit me or god decides for me for he is the best of deciders
Yusuf,28,-0.2201,0.135,0.789,0.076,go back to your father and say our father your son ha stolen we testify only to what we know and we could not have prevented the unforeseen
Yusuf,17,0.4588,0.0,0.842,0.158,ask the town where we were and the caravan in which we came we are being truthful

Yusuf,23,-0.8555,0.32,0.68,0.0,then he turned away from them and said my bitterness for joseph and his eye turned white from sorrow and he became depressed
Yusuf,21,-0.0289,0.124,0.717,0.159,they said by god you will not stop remembering joseph until you have ruined your health or you have passed away

Yusuf,79,0.862,0.1,0.693,0.207,and he elevated his parent on the throne and they fell prostrate before him he said father this is the fulfillment of my vision of long ago my lord ha made it come true he ha blessed me when he released me from prison and brought you out of the wilderness after the devil had sown conflict between me and my brother my lord is most kind towards whomever he will he is the all knowing the most wise

Al-Qasas,31,0.5267,0.0,0.898,0.102,but when moses came to them with our sign clear and manifest they said this is nothing but fabricated magic and we never heard of this from our ancestor of old
Al-Qasas,29,-0.1351,0.083,0.851,0.066,moses said my lord is well aware of him who brings guidance from him and him who will have the sequel of the abode the wrongdoer will not succeed

Al-Qasas,21,-0.6124,0.217,0.783,0.0,he and his troop acted arrogantly in the land with no justification they thought they would not be returned to u
Al-Qasas,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we seized him and his troop and we threw them into the sea observe therefore what wa the end of the oppressor
Al-Qasas,18,-0.5764,0.228,0.772,0.0,and we made them leader calling to the fire and on resurrection day they will not be saved
Al-Qasas,19,-0.7351,0.267,0.733,0.0,and we pursued them in this world with curse and on resurrection day they will be among the despised
Al-Qasas,26,0.3612,0.0,0.906,0.094,we gave moses the scripture after we had annihilated the previous generation a an illumination for mankind and guidance and mercy so that they may remember
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you were not on the western side when we decreed the command to moses nor were you among the witness
Al-Qasas,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we established many generation and time took it toll on them nor were you among the people of median reciting our revelation to them but we kept sending messenger
Al-Qasas,36,-0.0258,0.092,0.844,0.064,nor were you by the side of the mount when we proclaimed rather it wa mercy from your lord that you may warn people who received no warner before you so that they may take heed
Al-Qasas,36,0.4939,0.0,0.912,0.088,otherwise if calamity befell them a result of what their hand have perpetrated they would say our lord if only you had sent u messenger we would have followed your revelation and been among the believer
Al-Qasas,54,0.8263,0.0,0.835,0.165,but when the truth came to them from u they said if only he wa given the like of what wa given to moses did they not disbelieve in what wa given to moses in the past they said two work of magic backing one another and they said we are disbelieving in both
Al-Qasas,20,0.6249,0.0,0.779,0.221,say then bring scripture from god more conductive to guidance than both and will follow it if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,36,-0.8413,0.267,0.658,0.075,but if they fail to respond to you know that they follow their fancy and who is more lost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from god god doe not guide the unjust people
Al-Qasas,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we have delivered the word to them that they may remember
Al-Qasas,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the scripture before it believe in it
Al-Qasas,26,0.3182,0.0,0.916,0.084,when it is recited to them they say we have believed in it it is the truth from our lord we were muslim prior to it

Al-Qasas,28,0.6979,0.0,0.818,0.182,your lord never destroys city without first sending messenger in their midst reciting to them our revelation and we never destroy the city unless their people are wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,29,0.7579,0.0,0.806,0.194,whatever thing you are given is but the material of this world and it glitter but what is with god is better and longer lasting do you not comprehend
Al-Qasas,36,0.5187,0.0,0.86,0.14,can someone to whom we have made fine promise which he will attain be equal to someone to whom we have given enjoyment in this world but who will be on resurrection day among the arraigned

Al-Qasas,41,-0.8051,0.233,0.654,0.113,he said wa given all this on account of knowledge posse did he not know that god destroyed many generation before him who were stronger than he and possessed greater rich but the guilty will not be asked about their sin
Al-Qasas,33,0.8955,0.0,0.711,0.289,and he went out before his people in his splendor those who desired the worldly life said if only we possessed the like of what quaroon wa given he is indeed very fortunate
Al-Qasas,31,0.8847,0.085,0.594,0.321,but those who were given knowledge said woe to you the reward of god is better for those who believe and do righteous deed yet none attains it except the steadfast
