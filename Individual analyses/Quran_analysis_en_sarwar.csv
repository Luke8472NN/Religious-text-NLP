Yusuf,25,-0.6416,0.186,0.814,0.0,his father said my son do not tell your dream to your brother lest they plot against you satan is the sworn enemy of man
Yusuf,44,0.9371,0.0,0.674,0.326,thus your lord will select you teach you the interpretation of dream and grant his favor to you and the family of jacob just a he granted his favor to your father abraham and isaac your lord is certainly all knowing and all wise
Yusuf,20,0.3182,0.0,0.892,0.108,in the story of joseph and his brother there is evidence of the truth for those who seek to know
Yusuf,36,0.0498,0.164,0.689,0.147,joseph brother said to one another there is no doubt that joseph and his brother are more loved by our father even though we are all his offspring he our father is certainly in manifest error
Yusuf,33,-0.7096,0.164,0.836,0.0,some of them suggested let u kill joseph or leave him somewhere far away from the presence of our father only then shall we receive equal treatment and thereafter can become righteous people
Yusuf,26,0.6148,0.0,0.827,0.173,one of them said do not kill joseph but if you must throw him into dark well so that perhaps some caravan will take him away
Yusuf,18,-0.1536,0.136,0.757,0.106,then they asked their father why do you not trust u with joseph we are his well wishers
Yusuf,17,0.8271,0.0,0.531,0.469,send him with u tomorrow to play with u and enjoy himself we shall carefully protect him
Yusuf,22,-0.8658,0.338,0.662,0.0,jacob replied shall be grieved if you take him with you fear that some wild beast will harm him in your absence
Yusuf,27,0.6124,0.158,0.574,0.268,they said if some wild beast would be able to harm him despite the presence of our strong group it would certainly be great loss to u
Yusuf,38,0.4939,0.0,0.896,0.104,when they took joseph with them they agreed to throw him into the well we revealed to joseph that sometime in the future at time when they would not recognize him he would remind them of all this

Yusuf,18,-0.296,0.115,0.885,0.0,in selling him they asked for very small price and even then no one wanted to buy him
Yusuf,57,0.743,0.0,0.829,0.171,the egyptian who bought him said to his wife be kind to him perhaps he will be of some benefit to u or we may adopt him thus we settled joseph in the land so that we could teach him the interpretation of dream god ha full control over his affair but most people do not know
Yusuf,19,0.936,0.0,0.478,0.522,when he attained maturity god gave him strength wisdom and knowledge thus do we reward those who do good
Yusuf,39,0.7845,0.108,0.629,0.263,his master wife then tried to seduce him she locked the door and said to him come on he said seek refuge in god who ha given me good place of shelter the unjust will certainly have no happiness
Yusuf,39,0.7067,0.129,0.592,0.279,she wa determined to have him and were it not for his faith in god he would certainly have yielded to her thus did we protect him from evil and indecency he wa certainly one of our sincere servant
Yusuf,52,-0.8316,0.172,0.784,0.044,she chased him to the door grabbed him from behind and tore off his shirt suddenly they were face to face with her husband looking accusingly at joseph she asked her husband what punishment is more fitting for those who have evil desire towards your household other than imprisonment and painful torment
Yusuf,37,-0.1779,0.125,0.766,0.109,joseph said it wa she who tried to seduce me someone from the household in confirmation of joseph statement said if his shirt it torn from the front she ha spoken the truth and he is lying
Yusuf,17,-0.631,0.295,0.582,0.123,but if his shirt is torn from behind she is lying and he is speaking the truth
Yusuf,28,0.1027,0.066,0.855,0.079,when the master saw that joseph shirt wa torn from behind he told his wife this is some of your womanly guile in which you are certainly skillful
Yusuf,18,-0.5574,0.25,0.658,0.092,joseph stay away from such affair and you woman ask forgiveness for your sin the guilt is yours
Yusuf,36,0.1027,0.202,0.609,0.189,some of the woman in the town started to gossip saying the king wife ha tried to seduce her servant and ha fallen madly in love with him we think that she is in manifest error
Yusuf,53,0.8958,0.053,0.724,0.223,when she heard their gossiping she invited them to her house for banquet and gave knife to each of them then she told joseph to appear before them when they saw joseph they were so amazed that they cut their hand and said goodness gracious he is not mortal but is charming angel
Yusuf,43,-0.745,0.134,0.866,0.0,she said this is the one on whose account you subjected me to all this blame tried to seduce him but he abstained if he doe not yield to me shall order him to be locked up in prison to make him humble
Yusuf,31,0.4215,0.144,0.619,0.238,joseph said lord prison is dearer to me than that which woman want me to do unless you protect me from their guile shall be attracted to them in my ignorance
Yusuf,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,his lord heard his prayer and protected him from their guile he is all hearing and all knowing
Yusuf,30,-0.4588,0.155,0.776,0.069,even after joseph had been found innocent of any crime the king and his people decided to imprison him for an appointed time so that people would forget the incident
Yusuf,62,0.25,0.049,0.843,0.108,two young men were also sent to serve prison sentence for different reason one of them said had dream in which wa brewing wine the other one said in my dream wa carrying some bread on my head and bird were eating that bread they asked joseph if he would interpret their dream they said we believe you to be righteous person
Yusuf,54,0.8012,0.03,0.806,0.164,joseph said to prove that my interpretation of your dream is true can tell you what kind of food you will receive even before it come to you my lord ha given me such talent have given up the tradition of the people who do not believe in god and the day of judgment
Yusuf,40,0.0235,0.072,0.808,0.12,and have embraced the religion of my father abraham isaac and jacob we are not supposed to consider anything equal to god this is part of god blessing to u and the people but most people do not give thanks
Yusuf,15,0.128,0.171,0.585,0.244,my fellow prisoner can many different master be considered better than one all dominant god
Yusuf,59,0.9239,0.081,0.638,0.28,what you worship instead of god are no more than empty name that you and your father have given to certain thing god ha not given any authority to such name judgment belongs to no one but god he ha commanded you to worship nothing but him this is the only true religion but most people do not know
Yusuf,43,0.2263,0.072,0.798,0.131,fellow prisoner your dream tell that one of you will serve wine to his master and the other will be crucified and his head consumed by the bird judgment ha already been passed about the meaning of the dream that you asked about
Yusuf,38,-0.6369,0.126,0.874,0.0,joseph asked the one whom he knew would not be executed to mention his case to his lord satan caused that man to forget all about joseph and his case thus joseph remained in prison for some year
Yusuf,44,0.6124,0.0,0.894,0.106,sometimes later the king dreamt that seven lean cow were eating seven fat one and that there were seven green ear of corn and seven dry one he asked the noble to tell him the meaning of his dream if they were able to

Yusuf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,joseph said cultivate your land for seven year a usual and preserve the produce with it ear each year except the little amount that you will consume
Yusuf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,after this will ensue seven year of famine in which all the grain that you have stored will be consumed except small quantity
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then there will be year with plenty of rain and people will have sufficient milk and other produce
Yusuf,37,0.2732,0.052,0.868,0.079,the king ordered his people to bring joseph into his presence when the messenger came to joseph he joseph said ask your master about the woman who cut their hand my lord know all about their guile

Yusuf,34,0.682,0.072,0.673,0.255,thus we settled joseph in the land to live wherever he wanted we grant due share of our mercy to whomever we want and we do not ignore the reward of the righteous one
Yusuf,20,0.8979,0.0,0.573,0.427,the reward in the next life is certainly better for the faithful one who have observed piety in this life
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,joseph brother came to him when they entered his court he recognized them they did not know him
Yusuf,34,0.2732,0.0,0.938,0.062,when he had furnished them with provision he said next time bring me your other brother from your father a you can see give each of you certain amount of grain am polite host

Yusuf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then joseph told his people to put his brother money back into their bag so that perhaps they would recognize it when at home and come back to egypt once again
Yusuf,42,-0.1779,0.053,0.911,0.036,when they returned to their father they told him father unless we take our brother they will refuse u one further measure of grain send our brother with u so that we can obtain that measure we shall watch over him carefully
Yusuf,28,0.9274,0.0,0.612,0.388,jacob replied how can trust you after what happened to his brother before only god is the best protector his mercy is far greater than that of others
Yusuf,59,0.8158,0.0,0.851,0.149,when they opened their baggage they found that their money had been returned to them they said father what more do we want our money ha been given back to u we can buy more provision with this for our family we shall protect our brother and have one more camel load of grain which is easy to get

Yusuf,50,0.6858,0.0,0.836,0.164,even though they entered the town a their father had told them it would not have been of any avail to them against the decree of god it only served to satisfy jacob desire and judgment he wa certainly well versed by our instruction but most people do not know

Yusuf,22,-0.875,0.345,0.655,0.0,the egyptian said what do you suggest should be the punishment for the thief if it is proved that you are lying
Yusuf,22,-0.7579,0.245,0.755,0.0,joseph brother replied in whosoever baggage it is found that person will be your bondsman thus is the punishment of the unjust
Yusuf,62,0.34,0.0,0.946,0.054,they searched their baggage before that of joseph real brother where at last they found it thus we showed joseph how to plan this he would not have been able to take his brother under the king law unless god had wanted it to be so we give high rank to whomever we want over every knowledgeable person is one more knowing
Yusuf,40,0.128,0.19,0.649,0.161,joseph brother said it no wonder that he steal brother of his had stolen before him joseph noted their remark but did not utter word he said to himself you are in worse position god know best what you allege
