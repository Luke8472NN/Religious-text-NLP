Al-Araf,44,0.7184,0.0,0.848,0.152,and when the plague smote them they said moses pray to your lord for u invoking the promise he ha made with you if you lift the plague from u we will believe in you and let the child of israel go with you
Al-Araf,20,-0.1531,0.149,0.685,0.165,but when we had lifted the plague from them for term which they had to reach they broke their promise
Al-Araf,22,-0.8548,0.33,0.67,0.0,so we punished them and drowned them in the sea for they had belied our sign and gave no heed to them
Al-Araf,48,0.296,0.098,0.783,0.119,we gave the persecuted nation dominion over the eastern and western land which we had blessed so the word of your lord the finest wa fulfilled for the child of israel because of their patience and we destroyed the edifice and tower of pharaoh and whatsoever they manufactured

Al-Araf,88,-0.5719,0.041,0.959,0.0,and when moses came at the appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said lord let me see that can look at you he replied you shall not see me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in it place then shall you see me and when his lord wa revealed to the mountain and caused it to be crushed and leveled whereupon moses fell down senseless and when he recovered he said exaltation to you repent to you am the first of believer
Al-Araf,26,0.5719,0.0,0.871,0.129,he said moses have chosen you from all mankind with my message and my word therefore take what have given you and be among the thankful
Al-Araf,40,0.5267,0.072,0.784,0.144,we inscribed for him upon the tablet all kind of exhortation and clear explanation of all thing so take it forcefully and order your nation to take what is best of it shall show you the home of the wicked
Al-Araf,64,-0.6858,0.085,0.915,0.0,from my sign will turn away the unrightfully arrogant in the land so that even if they witness every sign they would not believe it if they see the path of righteousness they shall not take it a path but if they see the path of error they shall take it for their path because they belied our sign and were inattentive towards them
Al-Araf,26,-0.4215,0.101,0.899,0.0,vain are the deed of those who belie our sign and the everlasting life shall they not be recompensed except for what they used to do
Al-Araf,41,0.296,0.0,0.948,0.052,in his absence the nation of moses made calf from their ornament body with hollow sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to path yet they took it in worship and were harmdoers
Al-Araf,31,0.3259,0.149,0.666,0.185,but when it landed in their hand and saw that they had strayed they said if our lord doe not have mercy on u and forgive u we shall be lost
Al-Araf,74,-0.9198,0.219,0.718,0.063,and when moses returned to his nation angry and sorrowful he said evil is what you have done in my absence would you hasten the retribution of your lord he threw down the tablet and seizing his brother by the head dragged him towards him son of my mother said aaron the nation weakened me and almost killed me do not let my enemy rejoice over me do not number me among the harmdoers

Al-Araf,22,-0.6597,0.243,0.669,0.088,when his anger abated moses took up the tablet upon which wa inscribed guidance and mercy to those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,85,-0.5574,0.159,0.729,0.112,moses chose from among his nation seventy men for our appointment and when the quake seized them moses said my lord had it been your will you would have destroyed them before and me will you destroy u for that which the fool amongst u did it is only your trial by which you leave in error whom you will and guide whom you will you alone are our guardian forgive u and have mercy on u you are the best of those who forgive
Al-Araf,53,0.7506,0.104,0.692,0.204,write for u what is good in this life and in the everlasting life to you alone we turn he replied will smite with my punishment whom will yet my mercy embrace all thing will write it my mercy to those who are cautious give the obligatory charity and believe in our verse
Al-Araf,89,0.5994,0.091,0.771,0.138,and to those who shall follow the messenger the unlettered prophet muhammad whom they shall find written with them in the torah and the gospel he will order kindness upon them and forbid them to do evil he will make good thing lawful to them and prohibit all that is foul he will relieve them of their burden and of the shackle that weigh upon them those who believe in him and honor him those who aid him and follow the light sent forth with him shall surely prosper

Al-Araf,16,0.3182,0.0,0.867,0.133,yet among the people of moses there wa nation who preached the truth and acted justly
Al-Araf,76,-0.7391,0.126,0.85,0.024,we divided them into twelve tribe each nation and when his people demanded drink we revealed to moses strike the rock with your staff thereupon twelve spring gushed from the rock and each tribe knew it drinkingplace we caused the cloud to cast their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quail saying eat of the good thing we have provided for you indeed they did u no wrong but they wronged themselves
Al-Araf,34,0.3818,0.088,0.711,0.201,when it wa said to them dwell in this village and eat of whatever you please and say unburdening and enter the gate prostrating we will forgive you your sin and increase the gooddoers
Al-Araf,24,-0.8271,0.321,0.583,0.096,the wicked amongst them changed what wa said for other word therefore we sent down upon them from heaven punishment for their evil doing

Al-Araf,31,-0.7184,0.221,0.718,0.061,and when some asked why do you admonish nation whom allah will destroy or sternly punish they replied seeking pardon from your lord and in order that they may be cautious
Al-Araf,34,-0.9705,0.44,0.508,0.053,therefore when they forgot that of which they were reminded we saved those who were forbidding evil and seized the evildoer with an evil punishment for that which they used to do of evil
Al-Araf,19,-0.6705,0.244,0.756,0.0,and when they had scornfully persisted in what they had been forbidden we said to them be ape despised

Al-Araf,26,-0.3612,0.141,0.767,0.093,we dispersed them through the earth in nation some were righteous others were not and tested them with good and evil in order that they return
Al-Araf,71,0.8779,0.084,0.734,0.182,then others succeeded them who inherited the book and availed themselves of the vanity of this lower world saying it will be forgiven u but if similar vanity came their way they would again take them have they not taken the covenant of the book which they have studied to tell nothing of allah except what is true surely the everlasting life is better for the cautious do you not understand

Al-Qasas,24,0.7003,0.0,0.791,0.209,so he drew water for them and then retired to the shade saying my lord surely have need of whatever good you send me
Al-Qasas,57,0.4019,0.029,0.897,0.074,then one of the two came to him walking shyly and said my father invite you so that he can recompense you with wage for having drawn water for u so when he came to him and told him his story the father said do not be afraid you have been saved from the nation of harmdoers

Al-Qasas,49,0.1265,0.046,0.899,0.055,he said will let you marry one of these two daughter of mine on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight year if you complete ten that is of your own accord shall not press you surely you will find me if allah will among the good
Al-Qasas,30,-0.4588,0.165,0.754,0.081,so be it between me and you said moses whichever of the two term fulfill it will be no injustice to me allah is the guardian of what we say
Al-Qasas,51,-0.3612,0.124,0.794,0.081,and when moses had fulfilled the term and departed with his household he saw from far away on the side of the tor fire he said to his household stay here for can see fire perhaps can bring you news or flame from the fire so that you can warm yourselves

Al-Qasas,17,-0.8271,0.339,0.661,0.0,my lord said moses have killed living soul among them and fear that they will slay me
Al-Qasas,25,0.7003,0.099,0.59,0.311,aaron my brother ha more eloquent tongue than please send him with me a helper to confirm speak truly fear that they will belie me
Al-Qasas,37,0.3666,0.028,0.879,0.093,he said we will strengthen your arm with your brother and appoint for you both an authority so that they shall not reach you with our sign you and those who follow you shall be the victor
