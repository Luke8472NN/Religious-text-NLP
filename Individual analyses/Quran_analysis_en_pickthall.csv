Al-Araf,45,-0.5994,0.12,0.838,0.042,the chief of pharaoh people said king wilt thou suffer moses and his people to make mischief in the land and flout thee and thy god he said we will slay their son and spare their woman for lo we are in power over them
Al-Araf,40,0.4019,0.0,0.935,0.065,and moses said unto his people seek help in allah and endure lo the earth is allah he giveth it for an inheritance to whom he will and lo the sequel is for those who keep their duty unto him
Al-Araf,45,-0.8979,0.234,0.766,0.0,they said we suffered hurt before thou camest unto u and since thou hast come unto u he said it may be that your lord is going to destroy your adversary and make you viceroy in the earth that he may see how ye behave
Al-Araf,16,-0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,and we straitened pharaoh folk with famine and dearth of fruit that peradventure they might heed
Al-Araf,42,-0.9274,0.29,0.587,0.122,but whenever good befell them they said this is ours and whenever evil smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspex of moses and those with him surely their evil auspice wa only with allah but most of them knew not
Al-Araf,18,-0.3252,0.127,0.873,0.0,and they said whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch u we shall not put faith in thee
Al-Araf,31,-0.7783,0.209,0.707,0.084,so we sent against them the flood and the locust and the vermin and the frog and the blood succession of clear sign but they were arrogant and became guilty folk
Al-Araf,44,-0.5859,0.181,0.712,0.108,and when the terror fell on them they cried moses pray for u unto thy lord because he hath covenant with thee if thou removest the terror from u we verily will trust thee and will let the child of israel go with thee
Al-Araf,20,-0.8462,0.314,0.643,0.043,but when we did remove from them the terror for term which they must reach behold they broke their covenant
Al-Araf,23,-0.7783,0.245,0.755,0.0,therefore we took retribution from them therefore we drowned them in the sea because they denied our revelation and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,59,0.743,0.04,0.825,0.135,and we caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern part of the land and the western part thereof which we had blessed and the fair word of thy lord wa fulfilled for the child of israel because of their endurance and we annihilated all that pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had contrived
Al-Araf,45,0.4939,0.0,0.907,0.093,and we brought the child of israel across the sea and they came unto people who were given up to idol which they had they said moses make for u god even a they have god he said lo ye are folk who know not
Al-Araf,18,-0.7184,0.286,0.714,0.0,lo a for these their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing is in vain
Al-Araf,18,0.5994,0.0,0.766,0.234,he said shall seek for you god other than allah when he hath favoured you above all creature
Al-Araf,31,-0.4404,0.088,0.912,0.0,and remember when we did deliver you from pharaoh folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaughtering your son and sparing your woman that wa tremendous trial from your lord
Al-Araf,52,-0.3612,0.047,0.953,0.0,and when we did appoint for moses thirty night of solitude and added to them ten and he completed the whole time appointed by his lord of forty night and moses said unto his brother aaron take my place among the people do right and follow not the way of mischief maker
Al-Araf,92,0.9349,0.0,0.871,0.129,and when moses came to our appointed tryst and his lord had spoken unto him he said my lord show me thy self that may gaze upon thee he said thou wilt not see me but gaze upon the mountain if it stand still in it place then thou wilt see me and when his lord revealed his glory to the mountain he sent it crashing down and moses fell down senseless and when he woke he said glory unto thee turn unto thee repentant and am the first of true believer
Al-Araf,29,0.5719,0.0,0.883,0.117,he said moses have preferred thee above mankind by my message and by my speaking unto thee so hold that which have given thee and be among the thankful
Al-Araf,48,0.0258,0.08,0.82,0.1,and we wrote for him upon the tablet the lesson to be drawn from all thing and the explanation of all thing then bade him hold it fast and command thy people saying take the better course made clear therein shall show thee the abode of evil liver
Al-Araf,63,-0.7351,0.107,0.893,0.0,shall turn away from my revelation those who magnify themselves wrongfully in the earth and if they see each token believe it not and if they see the way of righteousness choose it nor for their way and if they see the way of error choose if for their way that is because they deny our revelation and are used to disregard them
Al-Araf,25,0.2023,0.084,0.804,0.112,those who deny our revelation and the meeting of the hereafter their work are fruitless are they requited aught save what they used to do
Al-Araf,47,-0.34,0.091,0.866,0.043,and the folk of moses after he left them chose calf for worship made out of their ornament of saffron hue which gave lowing sound saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way they chose it and became wrong doer
Al-Araf,32,-0.2263,0.152,0.72,0.127,and when they feared the consequence thereof and saw that they had gone astray they said unless our lord have mercy on u and forgive u we verily are of the lost
Al-Araf,84,-0.9535,0.213,0.73,0.057,and when moses returned unto his people angry and grieved he said evil is that course which ye took after had left you would ye hasten on the judgment of your lord and he cast down the tablet and he seized his brother by the head dragging him toward him he said son of my mother lo the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me oh make not mine enemy to triumph over me and place me not among the evil doer
Al-Araf,26,0.7579,0.0,0.746,0.254,he said my lord have mercy on me and on my brother bring u into thy mercy thou the most merciful of all who show mercy
Al-Araf,32,-0.7096,0.185,0.757,0.057,lo those who chose the calf for worship terror from their lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world thus do we requite those who invent lie
Al-Araf,19,0.0387,0.151,0.692,0.157,but those who do ill deed and afterward repent and believe lo for them afterward allah is forgiving merciful

Yusuf,26,0.1779,0.095,0.754,0.151,he said my dear son tell not thy brother of thy vision lest they plot plot against thee lo satan is for man an open foe

Yusuf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily in joseph and his brother are sign of allah sovereignty for the inquiring
Yusuf,27,0.4404,0.0,0.9,0.1,when they said verily joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are many though we be lo our father is in plain aberration
Yusuf,29,-0.4215,0.136,0.78,0.084,one said kill joseph or cast him to some other land so that your father favour may be all for you and that ye may afterward be righteous folk
Yusuf,26,-0.431,0.102,0.898,0.0,one among them said kill not joseph but if ye must be doing fling him into the depth of the pit some caravan will find him
Yusuf,20,0.5264,0.109,0.645,0.246,they said our father why wilt thou not trust u with joseph when lo we are good friend to him
Yusuf,22,0.8934,0.0,0.592,0.408,send him with u to morrow that he may enjoy himself and play and lo we shall take good care of him
Yusuf,28,-0.5859,0.183,0.749,0.069,he said lo in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you and fear le the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him
Yusuf,21,0.7987,0.0,0.727,0.273,they said if the wolf should devour him when we are so strong band then surely we should have already perished
Yusuf,40,0.4939,0.0,0.924,0.076,then when they led him off and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit we inspired in him thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know thee not

Yusuf,57,0.3182,0.0,0.941,0.059,and he of egypt who purchased him said unto his wife receive him honourably perchance he may prove useful to u or we may adopt him a son thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of event and allah wa predominant in his career but most of mankind know not
Yusuf,18,0.886,0.0,0.551,0.449,and and when he reached his prime we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus we reward the good
Yusuf,41,-0.8176,0.161,0.839,0.0,and she in whose house he wa asked of him an evil act she bolted the door and said come he said seek refuge in allah lo he is my lord who hath treated me honourably lo wrong doer never prosper
Yusuf,43,-0.5719,0.138,0.778,0.084,she verily desired him and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his lord thus it wa that we might ward off from him evil and lewdness lo he wa of our chosen slave
Yusuf,44,-0.7506,0.229,0.653,0.119,and they raced with one another to the door and she tore his shirt from behind and they met her lord and master at the door she said what shall be his reward who wisheth evil to thy folk save prison or painful doom
Yusuf,36,-0.8126,0.22,0.727,0.052,joseph said she it wa who asked of me an evil act and witness of her own folk testified if his shirt is torn from before then she speaketh truth and he is of the liar
Yusuf,18,-0.1531,0.204,0.664,0.133,and if his shirt is torn from behind then she hath lied and he is of the truthful
Yusuf,28,0.5256,0.062,0.803,0.136,so when he saw his shirt torn from behind he said lo this is of the guile of you woman lo the guile of you is very great
Yusuf,19,-0.5859,0.246,0.667,0.088,joseph turn away from this and thou woman ask forgiveness for thy sin lo thou art of the faulty
Yusuf,34,0.5859,0.069,0.767,0.163,and woman in the city said the ruler wife is asking of her slave boy an ill deed indeed he ha smitten her to the heart with love we behold her in plain aberration
Yusuf,68,0.7269,0.056,0.808,0.136,and when she heard of their sly talk she sent to them and prepared for them cushioned couch to lie on at the feast and gave to every one of them knife and said to joseph come out unto them and when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hand exclaiming allah blameless this is no human being this is not other than some gracious angel
Yusuf,41,-0.886,0.236,0.764,0.0,she said this is he on whose account ye blamed me asked of him an evil act but he proved continent but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low
Yusuf,34,-0.3626,0.137,0.789,0.074,he said my lord prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me and if thou fend not off their wile from me shall incline unto them and become of the foolish
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord heard his prayer and fended off their wile from him lo he is hearer knower
Yusuf,23,0.6705,0.0,0.792,0.208,and it seemed good to them the men folk after they had seen the sign of his innocence to imprison him for time
Yusuf,48,-0.1027,0.064,0.879,0.057,and two young men went to prison with him one of them said dreamed that wa pressing wine the other said dreamed that wa carrying upon my head bread whereof the bird were eating announce unto u the interpretation for we see thee of those good at interpretation
Yusuf,53,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said the food which ye are given daily shall not come unto you but shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you this is of that which my lord hath taught me lo have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in allah and are disbeliever in the hereafter
Yusuf,47,-0.4782,0.067,0.933,0.0,and have followed the religion of my father abraham and isaac and jacob it never wa for u to attribute aught a partner to allah this is of the bounty of allah unto u the seed of abraham and unto mankind but most men give not thanks
Yusuf,12,-0.1531,0.213,0.61,0.177,my fellow prisoner are diver lord better or allah the one almighty
Yusuf,50,-0.4295,0.11,0.812,0.078,those whom ye worship beside him are but name which ye have named ye and your father allah hath revealed no sanction for them the decision rest with allah only who hath commanded you that ye worship none save him this is the right religion but most men know not
Yusuf,47,-0.5423,0.074,0.926,0.0,my two fellow prisoner a for one of you he will pour out wine for his lord to drink and a for the other he will be crucified so that the bird will eat from his head thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire
Yusuf,43,-0.7783,0.142,0.858,0.0,and he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released mention me in the presence of thy lord but satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord so he joseph stayed in prison for some year
Yusuf,37,0.6124,0.0,0.85,0.15,and the king said lo saw in dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and seven green ear of corn and other seven dry notable expound for me my vision if ye can interpret dream
Yusuf,14,0.4588,0.0,0.75,0.25,they answered jumbled dream and we are not knowing in the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he of the two who wa released and now at length remembered said am going to announce unto you the interpretation therefore send me forth
Yusuf,49,-0.0772,0.063,0.88,0.057,and when he came to joseph in the prison he exclaimed joseph thou truthful one expound for u the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ear of corn and other seven dry that may return unto the people so that they may know
Yusuf,25,0.6124,0.047,0.797,0.156,he said ye shall sow seven year a usual but that which ye reap leave it in the ear all save little which ye eat
Yusuf,26,0.5719,0.047,0.78,0.173,then after that will come seven hard year which will devour all that ye have prepared for them save little of that which ye have stored
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then after that will come year when the people will have plenteous crop and when they will press wine and oil
Yusuf,42,0.2732,0.046,0.883,0.071,and the king said bring him unto me and when the messenger came unto him he joseph said return unto thy lord and ask him what wa the case of the woman who cut their hand lo my lord knoweth their guile
Yusuf,54,-0.8176,0.216,0.645,0.139,he the king then sent for those woman and said what happened when ye asked an evil act of joseph they answered allah blameless we know no evil of him said the wife of the ruler now the truth is out asked of him an evil act and he is surely of the truthful
Yusuf,29,-0.2732,0.118,0.796,0.086,then joseph said asked for this that he my lord may know that betrayed him not in secret and that surely allah guideth not the snare of the betrayer
Yusuf,24,0.4939,0.133,0.606,0.261,do not exculpate myself lo the human soul enjoineth unto evil save that whereon my lord hath mercy lo my lord is forgiving merciful
Yusuf,35,0.4767,0.0,0.916,0.084,and the king said bring him unto me that may attach him to my person and when he had talked with him he said lo thou art to day in our presence established and trusted
Yusuf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said set me over the storehouse of the land lo am skilled custodian
Yusuf,34,0.4023,0.132,0.65,0.218,thus gave we power to joseph in the land he wa the owner of it where he pleased we reach with our mercy whom we will we lose not the reward of the good
Yusuf,16,0.296,0.183,0.542,0.275,and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and ward off evil
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and joseph brother came and presented themselves before him and he knew them but they knew him not
Yusuf,33,0.6369,0.0,0.884,0.116,and when he provided them with their provision he said bring unto me brother of yours from your father see ye not that fill up the measure and am the best of host
Yusuf,23,-0.296,0.091,0.909,0.0,and if ye bring him not unto me then there shall be no measure for you with me nor shall ye draw near
Yusuf,16,0.7717,0.0,0.676,0.324,they said we will try to win him from his father that we will surely do
Yusuf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said unto his young men place their merchandise in their saddlebag so that they may know it when they go back to their folk and so will come again
Yusuf,35,0.2732,0.077,0.792,0.132,so when they went back to their father they said our father the measure is denied u so send with u our brother that we may obtain the measure surely we will guard him well
Yusuf,31,0.8555,0.0,0.714,0.286,he said can entrust him to you save a entrusted his brother to you aforetime allah is better at guarding and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
Yusuf,61,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when they opened their belonging they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them they said our father what more can we ask here is our merchandise returned to u we shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother and we shall have the extra measure of camel load this that we bring now is light measure
Yusuf,48,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of allah that ye will bring him back to me unless ye are surrounded and when they gave him their undertaking he said allah is the warden over what we say
Yusuf,46,0.8519,0.0,0.819,0.181,and he said my son go not in by one gate go in by different gate can naught avail you a against allah lo the decision rest with allah only in him do put my trust and in him let all the trusting put their trust
Yusuf,50,0.5719,0.0,0.928,0.072,and when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined it would have naught availed them a against allah it wa but need of jacob soul which he thus satisfied and lo he wa lord of knowledge because we had taught him but most of mankind know not
Yusuf,26,-0.5267,0.12,0.88,0.0,and when they went in before joseph he took his brother unto him saying lo even am thy brother therefore sorrow not for what they did
Yusuf,28,-0.4767,0.177,0.737,0.086,and when he provided them with their provision he put the drinking cup in his brother saddlebag and then crier cried camel rider lo ye are surely thief
Yusuf,11,-0.5994,0.353,0.647,0.0,they cried coming toward them what is it ye have lost
Yusuf,24,-0.3182,0.091,0.909,0.0,they said we have lost the king cup and he who bringeth it shall have camel load and said joseph am answerable for it
Yusuf,20,0.0041,0.206,0.588,0.206,they said by allah well ye know we came not to do evil in the land and are no thief
Yusuf,14,-0.743,0.344,0.656,0.0,they said and what shall be the penalty for it if ye prove liar
Yusuf,25,-0.8442,0.293,0.707,0.0,they said the penalty for it he in whose bag the cup is found he is the penalty for it thus we requite wrong doer
Yusuf,62,0.3612,0.0,0.961,0.039,then he joseph began the search with their bag before his brother bag then he produced it from his brother bag thus did we contrive for joseph he could not have taken his brother according to the king law unless allah willed we raise by grade of mercy whom we will and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing
Yusuf,44,0.6808,0.077,0.761,0.162,they said if he stealeth brother of his stole before but joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them he said within himself ye are in worse case and allah knoweth best the truth of that which ye allege
Yusuf,29,0.4588,0.0,0.9,0.1,they said ruler of the land lo he hath very aged father so take one of u instead of him lo we behold thee of those who do kindness
Yusuf,23,0.1779,0.177,0.623,0.2,he said allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property then truly we should be wrong doer
Yusuf,64,-0.5046,0.116,0.826,0.058,so when they despaired of moving him they conferred together apart the eldest of them said know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in allah name and how ye failed in the case of joseph aforetime therefore shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or allah judgeth for me he is the best of judge
Yusuf,28,-0.4939,0.106,0.894,0.0,return unto your father and say our father lo thy son hath stolen we testify only to that which we know we are not guardian of the unseen
Yusuf,19,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,ask the township where we were and the caravan with which we travelled hither lo we speak the truth
Yusuf,49,0.631,0.0,0.92,0.08,and when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him he said nay but your mind have beguiled you into something my course is comely patience it may be that allah will bring them all unto me lo he only he is the knower the wise
Yusuf,25,-0.765,0.223,0.777,0.0,and he turned away from them and said ala my grief for joseph and his eye were whitened with the sorrow that he wa suppressing
Yusuf,22,-0.4767,0.129,0.871,0.0,they said by allah thou wilt never cease remembering joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish
Yusuf,19,-0.836,0.357,0.643,0.0,he said expose my distress and anguish only unto allah and know from allah that which ye know not
Yusuf,29,-0.0351,0.159,0.745,0.095,go my son and ascertain concerning joseph and his brother and despair not of the spirit of allah lo none despaireth of the spirit of allah save disbelieving folk
Yusuf,41,0.4497,0.09,0.757,0.154,and when they came again before him joseph they said ruler misfortune hath touched u and our folk and we bring but poor merchandise so fill for u the measure and be charitable unto u lo allah will requite the charitable
Yusuf,15,-0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,he said know ye what ye did unto joseph and his brother in your ignorance
Yusuf,43,0.5574,0.086,0.739,0.175,they said is it indeed thou who art joseph he said am joseph and this is my brother allah hath shown u favour lo he who wardeth off evil and endureth findeth favour for lo allah loseth not the wage of the kindly
Yusuf,16,-0.5574,0.205,0.795,0.0,they said by allah verily allah hath preferred thee above u and we were indeed sinful
Yusuf,22,-0.2023,0.193,0.643,0.164,he said have no fear this day may allah forgive you and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father face he will become again seer and come to me with all your folk
Yusuf,21,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,when the caravan departed their father had said truly am conscious of the breath of joseph though ye call me dotard
Yusuf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those around him said by allah lo thou art in thine old aberration
Yusuf,35,0.4588,0.0,0.919,0.081,then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid it on his face and he became seer once more he said said not unto you that know from allah that which ye know not
Yusuf,16,-0.7269,0.338,0.563,0.099,they said our father ask forgiveness of our sin for u for lo we were sinful
Yusuf,17,0.6124,0.0,0.75,0.25,he said shall ask forgiveness for you of my lord lo he is the forgiving the merciful
Yusuf,22,0.4404,0.0,0.879,0.121,and when they came in before joseph he took his parent unto him and said come into egypt safe if allah will
Yusuf,81,0.765,0.037,0.843,0.121,and he placed his parent on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate and he said my father this is the interpretation of my dream of old my lord hath made it true and he hath shown me kindness since he took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after satan had made strife between me and my brother lo my lord is tender unto whom he will he is the knower the wise
Yusuf,50,0.1531,0.069,0.833,0.098,my lord thou hast given me something of sovereignty and hast taught me something of the interpretation of event creator of the heaven and the earth thou art my protecting guardian in the world and the hereafter make me to die muslim unto thee and join me to the righteous
Yusuf,29,0.5719,0.0,0.883,0.117,this is of the tidings of the unseen which we inspire in thee muhammad thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming
Yusuf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and though thou try much most men will not believe
Yusuf,16,-0.296,0.128,0.872,0.0,thou askest them no fee for it it is naught else than reminder unto the people

Yusuf,25,-0.3818,0.17,0.748,0.082,deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of pall of allah punishment or the coming of the hour suddenly while they are unaware
Yusuf,25,0.7003,0.0,0.799,0.201,say this is my way call on allah with sure knowledge and whosoever followeth me glory be to allah and am not of the idolater
Yusuf,59,0.6124,0.093,0.758,0.149,we sent not before thee any messenger save men whom we inspired from among the folk of the township have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them and verily the abode of the hereafter for those who ward off evil is best have ye then no sense
Yusuf,32,-0.5994,0.224,0.644,0.131,till when the messenger despaired and thought that they were denied then came unto them our help and whom we would wa saved and our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty
Yusuf,35,0.3919,0.042,0.872,0.086,in their history verily there is lesson for men of understanding it is no invented story but confirmation of the existing scripture and detailed explanation of everything and guidance and mercy for folk who believe

An-Nahl,24,-0.3182,0.149,0.746,0.105,for those who believe not in the hereafter is an evil similitude and allah is the sublime similitude he is the mighty the wise
An-Nahl,43,-0.2444,0.046,0.929,0.024,if allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong doing he would not leave hereon living creature but he reprieveth them to an appointed term and when their term cometh they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it
An-Nahl,34,-0.3612,0.188,0.682,0.129,and they assign unto allah that which they themselves dislike and their tongue expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs assuredly theirs will be the fire and they will be abandoned
An-Nahl,33,-0.9382,0.31,0.69,0.0,by allah we verily sent messenger unto the nation before thee but the devil made their deed fairseeming unto them so he is their patron this day and theirs will be painful doom
An-Nahl,28,0.3612,0.0,0.912,0.088,and we have revealed the scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain unto them that wherein they differ and a guidance and mercy for people who believe

An-Nahl,54,0.9231,0.067,0.672,0.261,and allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision now those who are more favoured will by no mean hand over their provision to those slave whom their right hand posse so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof is it then the grace of allah that they deny
An-Nahl,46,0.7184,0.076,0.756,0.168,and allah hath given you wife of your own kind and hath given you from your wife son and grandson and hath made provision of good thing for you is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of allah that they disbelieve
An-Nahl,27,0.6705,0.067,0.699,0.234,and they worship beside allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for them from the heaven or the earth nor have they whom they worship any power
An-Nahl,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so coin not similitude for allah lo allah knoweth ye know not

An-Nahl,45,-0.0516,0.151,0.701,0.147,and allah coineth similitude two men one of them dumb having control of nothing and he is burden on his owner whithersoever he directeth him to go he bringeth no good is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth straight path of conduct
An-Nahl,40,0.09,0.045,0.877,0.078,and unto allah belongeth the unseen of the heaven and the earth and the matter of the hour of doom is but a twinkling of the eye or it is nearer still lo allah is able to do all thing
An-Nahl,27,0.4404,0.0,0.9,0.1,and allah brought you forth from the womb of your mother knowing nothing and gave you hearing and sight and heart that haply ye might give thanks

Al-Kahf,29,0.3612,0.0,0.912,0.088,when the young men fled for refuge to the cave and said our lord give u mercy from thy presence and shape for u right conduct in our plight
Al-Kahf,13,0.0772,0.0,0.902,0.098,then we sealed up their hearing in the cave for number of year
Al-Kahf,24,0.7845,0.0,0.761,0.239,and afterward we raised them up that we might know which of the two party would best calculate the time that they had tarried
Al-Kahf,24,0.5267,0.0,0.833,0.167,we narrate unto thee their story with truth lo they were young men who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,37,-0.25,0.124,0.798,0.077,and we made firm their heart when they stood forth and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth we cry unto no allah beside him for then should we utter an enormity
Al-Kahf,30,0.2263,0.141,0.667,0.192,these our people have chosen other god beside him though they bring no clear warrant vouchsafed to them and who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth lie concerning allah
Al-Kahf,37,0.5719,0.0,0.882,0.118,and when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except allah then seek refuge in the cave your lord will spread for you of his mercy and will prepare for you pillow in your plight
Al-Kahf,66,-0.3875,0.039,0.961,0.0,and thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right and when it set go past them on the left and they were in the cleft thereof that wa one of the portent of allah he whom allah guideth he indeed is led aright and he whom he sendeth astray for him thou wilt not find guiding friend
Al-Kahf,57,0.3818,0.0,0.956,0.044,and thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep and we caused them to turn over to the right and the left and their dog stretching out his paw on the threshold if thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight and hadst been filled with awe of them
Al-Kahf,82,0.8316,0.024,0.865,0.111,and in like manner we awakened them that they might question one another speaker from among them said how long have ye tarried they said we have tarried day or some part of day others said your lord best knoweth what ye have tarried now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city and let him see what food is purest there and bring you supply thereof let him be courteous and let no man know of you
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for they if they should come to know of you will stone you or turn you back to their religion then ye will never prosper
Al-Kahf,75,0.891,0.079,0.724,0.197,and in like manner we disclosed them to the people of the city that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that a for the hour there is no doubt concerning it when the people of the city disputed of their case among themselves they said build over them building their lord knoweth best concerning them those who won their point said we verily shall build place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,65,0.5212,0.037,0.864,0.099,some will say they were three their dog the fourth and some say five their dog the sixth guessing at random and some say seven and their dog the eighth say muhammad my lord is best aware of their number none knoweth them save few so contend not concerning them except with an outward contending and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and say not of anything lo shall do that tomorrow
Al-Kahf,28,0.3182,0.0,0.922,0.078,except if allah will and remember thy lord when thou forgettest and say it may be that my lord guideth me unto nearer way of truth than this
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and it is said they tarried in their cave three hundred year and add nine
Al-Kahf,45,0.9138,0.071,0.656,0.273,say allah is best aware how long they tarried his is the invisible of the heaven and the earth how clear of sight is he and keen of hearing they have no protecting friend beside him and he maketh none to share in his government
Al-Kahf,31,-0.296,0.068,0.932,0.0,and recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the scripture of thy lord there is none who can change his word and thou wilt find no refuge beside him
Al-Kahf,57,-0.7269,0.1,0.9,0.0,restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their lord at morn and evening seeking his countenance and let not thine eye overlook them desiring the pomp of the life of the world and obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned
Al-Kahf,61,-0.1779,0.107,0.796,0.097,say it is the truth from the lord of you all then whosoever will let him believe and whosoever will let him disbelieve lo we have prepared for disbeliever fire it tent encloseth them if they ask for shower they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the face calamitous the drink and ill the resting place
Al-Kahf,25,-0.7094,0.278,0.631,0.091,lo a for those who believe and do good work lo we suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost
Al-Kahf,45,0.7184,0.0,0.875,0.125,a for such theirs will be garden of eden wherein river flow beneath them therein they will be given armlet of gold and will wear green robe of finest silk and gold embroidery reclining upon throne therein blest the reward and fair the resting place
Al-Kahf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,coin for them similitude two men unto one of whom we had assigned two garden of grape and we had surrounded both with date palm and had put between them tillage
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,each of the garden gave it fruit and withheld naught thereof and we caused river to gush forth therein
Al-Kahf,27,0.836,0.0,0.729,0.271,and he had fruit and he said unto his comrade when he spake with him am more than thee in wealth and stronger in respect of men
Al-Kahf,21,-0.4404,0.127,0.873,0.0,and he went into his garden while he thus wronged himself he said think not that all this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,25,0.7003,0.0,0.791,0.209,think not that the hour will ever come and if indeed am brought back unto my lord surely shall find better than this a resort
Al-Kahf,28,-0.0258,0.07,0.864,0.066,his comrade when he thus spake with him exclaimed disbelievest thou in him who created thee of dust then of drop of seed and then fashioned thee man
Al-Kahf,13,-0.4215,0.189,0.811,0.0,but he is allah my lord and ascribe unto my lord no partner
Al-Kahf,37,0.8126,0.05,0.731,0.219,if only when thou enteredst thy garden thou hadst said that which allah willeth will come to pas there is no strength save in allah though thou seest me a le than thee in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,30,0.7351,0.0,0.819,0.181,yet it may be that my lord will give me better than thy garden and will send on it bolt from heaven and some morning it will be smooth hillside
Al-Kahf,21,-0.3182,0.103,0.897,0.0,or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it
Al-Kahf,43,-0.7003,0.176,0.762,0.062,and his fruit wa beset with destruction then began he to wring his hand for all that he had spent upon it when now it wa all ruined on it trellis and to say would that had ascribed no partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,18,-0.2796,0.224,0.65,0.125,and he had no troop of men to help him a against allah nor could he save himself
Al-Kahf,19,0.9423,0.0,0.502,0.498,in this case is protection only from allah the true he is best for reward and best for consequence
Al-Kahf,46,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and coin for them the similitude of the life of the world a water which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twig that the wind scatter allah is able to do all thing
Al-Kahf,32,0.9812,0.0,0.484,0.516,wealth and child are an ornament of the life of the world but the good deed which endure are better in thy lord sight for reward and better in respect of hope
Al-Kahf,31,-0.1226,0.049,0.951,0.0,and bethink you of the day when we remove the hill and ye see the earth emerging and we gather them together so a to leave not one of them behind
Al-Kahf,40,-0.3182,0.069,0.893,0.037,and they are set before thy lord in rank and it is said unto them now verily have ye come unto u a we created you at the first but ye thought that we had set no tryst for you
Al-Kahf,52,-0.8337,0.188,0.812,0.0,and the book is placed and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein and they say what kind of book is this that leaveth not small thing nor great thing but hath counted it and they find all that they did confronting them and thy lord wrongeth no one
Al-Kahf,59,-0.5829,0.144,0.765,0.091,and remember when we said unto the angel fall prostrate before adam and they fell prostrate all save iblis he wa of the jinni so he rebelled against his lord command will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friend instead of me when they are an enemy unto you calamitous is the exchange for evil doer
Al-Kahf,23,0.836,0.0,0.657,0.343,made them not to witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor their own creation nor choose misleader for my helper
Al-Kahf,40,-0.6808,0.128,0.872,0.0,and be mindful of the day when he will say call those partner of mine whom ye pretended then they will cry unto them but they will not hear their prayer and we shall set gulf of doom between them
Al-Kahf,23,-0.6908,0.263,0.676,0.06,and the guilty behold the fire and know that they are about to fall therein and they find no way of escape thence
Al-Kahf,22,-0.4932,0.132,0.868,0.0,and verily we have displayed for mankind in this qur an all manner of similitude but man is more than anything contentious
Al-Kahf,46,0.0772,0.088,0.819,0.094,and naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto them and from asking forgiveness of their lord unless it be that they wish that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or that they should be confronted with the doom
Al-Kahf,39,-0.3459,0.173,0.685,0.142,we send not the messenger save a bearer of good news and warner those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the truth thereby and they take our revelation and that wherewith they are threatened a jest
Al-Kahf,67,0.3818,0.043,0.879,0.078,and who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelation of his lord yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hand send forward to the judgment lo on their heart we have placed covering so that they understand not and in their ear deafness and though thou call them to the guidance in that case they can never be led aright
Al-Kahf,40,0.0,0.103,0.773,0.125,thy lord is the forgiver full of mercy if he took them to task now for what they earn he would hasten on the doom for them but theirs is an appointed term from which they will find no escape
Al-Kahf,19,-0.875,0.385,0.615,0.0,and all those township we destroyed them when they did wrong and we appointed fixed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,25,0.0258,0.0,0.956,0.044,and when moses said unto his servant will not give up until reach the point where the two river meet though march on for age
Al-Kahf,24,0.5719,0.0,0.824,0.176,and when they reached the point where the two met they forgot their fish and it took it way into the water being free
Al-Kahf,24,-0.25,0.083,0.917,0.0,and when they had gone further he said unto his servant bring u our breakfast verily we have found fatigue in this our journey
Al-Kahf,36,0.3291,0.059,0.849,0.092,he said didst thou see when we took refuge on the rock and forgot the fish and none but satan caused me to forget to mention it it took it way into the water by marvel
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this is that which we have been seeking so they retraced their step again
Al-Kahf,23,0.3612,0.0,0.894,0.106,then found they one of our slave unto whom we had given mercy from u and had taught him knowledge from our presence
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said unto him may follow thee to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught

Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said allah willing thou shalt find me patient and shall not in aught gainsay thee
Al-Kahf,21,0.2732,0.0,0.905,0.095,he said well if thou go with me ask me not concerning aught till myself make mention of it unto thee
Al-Kahf,34,-0.765,0.171,0.829,0.0,so they twain set out till when they were in the ship he made hole therein moses said hast thou made hole therein to drown the folk thereof thou verily hast done dreadful thing
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me
Al-Kahf,18,-0.3408,0.135,0.8,0.065,moses said be not wroth with me that forgot and be not hard upon me for my fault
Al-Kahf,33,-0.5106,0.15,0.787,0.063,so they twain journeyed on till when they met lad he slew him moses said what hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man verily thou hast done horrid thing
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me
Al-Kahf,21,0.0772,0.0,0.939,0.061,moses said if ask thee after this concerning aught keep not company with me thou hast received an excuse from me
Al-Kahf,57,-0.8537,0.154,0.822,0.024,so they twain journeyed on till when they came unto the folk of certain township they asked it folk for food but they refused to make them guest and they found therein wall upon the point of falling into ruin and he repaired it moses said if thou hadst wished thou couldst have taken payment for it
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this is the parting between thee and me will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience
Al-Kahf,31,-0.4767,0.097,0.903,0.0,a for the ship it belonged to poor people working on the river and wished to mar it for there wa king behind them who is taking every ship by force
Al-Kahf,21,-0.5719,0.207,0.793,0.0,and a for the lad his parent were believer and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief
Al-Kahf,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,and we intended that their lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy
Al-Kahf,71,0.8442,0.0,0.866,0.134,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the city and there wa beneath it treasure belonging to them and their father had been righteous and thy lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their treasure a mercy from their lord and did it not upon my own command such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will ask thee of dhu qarneyn say shall recite unto you remembrance of him

Al-Kahf,31,0.0,0.095,0.782,0.123,till when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in muddy spring and found people thereabout we said dhu qarneyn either punish or show them kindness
Al-Kahf,29,-0.9442,0.412,0.588,0.0,he said a for him who doeth wrong we shall punish him and then he will be brought back unto his lord who will punish him with awful punishment
Al-Kahf,22,0.872,0.0,0.681,0.319,but a for him who believeth and doeth right good will be his reward and we shall speak unto him mild command
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed road
Al-Kahf,24,-0.2023,0.086,0.859,0.055,till when he reached the rising place of the sun he found it rising on people for whom we had appointed no shelter therefrom
Al-Kahf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so it wa and we knew all concerning him
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed road
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,till when he came between the two mountain he found upon their hither side folk that scarce could understand saying
Al-Kahf,28,-0.2878,0.112,0.888,0.0,they said dhu qarneyn lo gog and magog are spoiling the land so may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set barrier between u and them
Al-Kahf,29,0.8689,0.0,0.726,0.274,he said that wherein my lord hath established me is better than your tribute do but help me with strength of men will set between you and them bank
Al-Kahf,35,-0.34,0.066,0.934,0.0,give me piece of iron till when he had levelled up the gap between the cliff he said blow till when he had made it fire he said bring me molten copper to pour thereon

Al-Qasas,32,-0.8176,0.2,0.8,0.0,lo pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made it people caste tribe among them he oppressed killing their son and sparing their woman lo he wa of those who work corruption
Al-Qasas,25,0.2263,0.103,0.731,0.166,and we desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth and to make them example and to make them the inheritor
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and to establish them in the earth and to show pharaoh and haman and their host that which they feared from them
Al-Qasas,43,-0.2206,0.105,0.829,0.066,and we inspired the mother of moses saying suckle him and when thou fearest for him then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve lo we shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him one of our messenger
Al-Qasas,28,-0.7845,0.21,0.79,0.0,and the family of pharaoh took him up that he might become for them an enemy and sorrow lo pharaoh and haman and their host were ever sinning
Al-Qasas,37,-0.6908,0.118,0.882,0.0,and the wife of pharaoh said he will be consolation for me and for thee kill him not peradventure he may be of use to u or we may choose him for son and they perceived not
Al-Qasas,30,-0.6124,0.121,0.879,0.0,and the heart of the mother of moses became void and she would have betrayed him if we had not fortified her heart that she might be of the believer
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said unto his sister trace him so she observed him from afar and they perceived not
Al-Qasas,27,0.1027,0.09,0.806,0.103,and we had before forbidden foster mother for him so she said shall show you household who will rear him for you and take care of him
Al-Qasas,33,0.7079,0.0,0.759,0.241,so we restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that the promise of allah is true but most of them know not
Al-Qasas,22,0.9274,0.0,0.538,0.462,and when he reached his full strength and wa ripe we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus do we reward the good
Al-Qasas,73,-0.9747,0.285,0.686,0.029,and he entered the city at time of carelessness of it folk and he found therein two men fighting one of his own caste and the other of his enemy and he who wa of his caste asked him for help against him who wa of his enemy so moses struck him with his fist and killed him he said this is of the devil doing lo he is an enemy mere misleader

Al-Qasas,45,-0.8271,0.195,0.805,0.0,and when he would have fallen upon the man who wa an enemy unto them both he said moses wouldst thou kill me a thou didst kill person yesterday thou wouldst be nothing but tyrant in the land thou wouldst not be of the reformer
Al-Qasas,35,0.5574,0.0,0.878,0.122,and man came from the uttermost part of the city running he said moses lo the chief take counsel against thee to slay thee therefor escape lo am of those who give thee good advice
Al-Qasas,17,-0.4588,0.181,0.735,0.083,so he escaped from thence fearing vigilant he said my lord deliver me from the wrongdoing folk
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he turned his face toward midian he said peradventure my lord will guide me in the right road
Al-Qasas,58,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he came unto the water of midian he found there whole tribe of men watering and he found apart from them two woman keeping back their flock he said what aileth you the two said we cannot give our flock to drink till the shepherd return from the water and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,28,0.128,0.077,0.831,0.093,so he watered their flock for them then he turned aside into the shade and said my lord am needy of whatever good thou sendest down for me
Al-Qasas,58,-0.0516,0.078,0.863,0.059,then there came unto him one of the two woman walking shyly she said lo my father biddeth thee that he may reward thee with payment for that thou didst water the flock for u then when he came unto him and told him the whole story he said fear not thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk
Al-Qasas,23,0.9022,0.0,0.643,0.357,one of the two woman said my father hire him for the best man that thou canst hire in the strong the trustworthy
Al-Qasas,58,0.0762,0.0,0.978,0.022,he said lo fain would marry thee to one of these two daughter of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for the term of eight pilgrimage then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord for would not make it hard for thee allah willing thou wilt find me of the righteous
Al-Qasas,30,-0.5994,0.169,0.774,0.057,he said that is settled between thee and me whichever of the two term fulfil there will be no injustice to me and allah is surety over what we say
Al-Qasas,49,-0.3612,0.129,0.787,0.084,then when moses had fulfilled the term and wa travelling with his housefolk he saw in the distance fire and said unto his housefolk bide ye here lo see in the distance fire peradventure shall bring you tidings thence or brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,32,0.6486,0.0,0.85,0.15,and when he reached it he wa called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field from the tree moses lo even am allah the lord of the world
Al-Qasas,40,-0.2023,0.075,0.869,0.056,throw down thy staff and when he saw it writhing a it had been demon he turned to flee headlong and it wa said unto him moses draw nigh and fear not lo thou art of those who are secure
Al-Qasas,42,-0.3867,0.147,0.737,0.116,thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without hurt and guard thy heart from fear then these shall be two proof from your lord unto pharaoh and his chief lo they are evil living folk
Al-Qasas,16,-0.9246,0.488,0.512,0.0,he said my lord lo killed man among them and fear that they will kill me
Al-Qasas,30,-0.2023,0.098,0.828,0.074,my brother aaron is more eloquent than me in speech therefor send him with me a helper to confirm me lo fear that they will give the lie to me
Al-Qasas,38,0.7207,0.025,0.83,0.145,he said we will strengthen thine arm with thy brother and we will give unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for our portent ye twain and those who follow you will be the winner
