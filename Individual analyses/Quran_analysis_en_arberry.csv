Al-Araf,40,0.6261,0.0,0.858,0.142,and remember when he appointed you successor after ad and lodged you in the land taking to yourselves castle of it plain and hewing it mountain into house remember god bounty and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
Al-Araf,46,0.6705,0.0,0.889,0.111,said the council of those of his people who waxed proud to those that were abased to those of them who believed do you know that salih is an envoy from his lord they said in the message he ha been sent with we are believer
Al-Araf,19,0.4767,0.0,0.838,0.162,said the one who waxed proud a for u we are unbeliever in the thing in which you believe
Al-Araf,29,-0.4767,0.107,0.893,0.0,so they hamstrung the she camel and turned in disdain from the commandment of their lord saying salih bring u that thou promisest u if thou art an envoy
Al-Araf,14,-0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate
Al-Araf,31,-0.7498,0.198,0.747,0.055,so he turned his back on them and said my people have delivered to you the message of my lord and advised you sincerely but you do not love sincere adviser
Al-Araf,25,0.5106,0.0,0.837,0.163,and lot when he said to his people what do you commit such indecency a never any being in all the world committed before you
Al-Araf,15,-0.296,0.136,0.864,0.0,see you approach men lustfully instead of woman no you are people that do exceed
Al-Araf,24,0.4019,0.098,0.712,0.19,and the only answer of his people wa that they said expel them from your city surely they are folk that keep themselves clean
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we delivered him and his family except his wife she wa one of those that tarried
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we rained down upon them rain so behold thou how wa the end of the sinner
Al-Araf,68,0.8357,0.058,0.758,0.183,and to midian their brother shuaib he said my people serve god you have no god other than he there ha now come to you clear sign from your lord so fill up the measure and the balance and diminish not the good of the people and do not corruption in the land after it ha been set right that is better for you if you are believer
Al-Araf,44,-0.3182,0.072,0.884,0.044,and do not sit in every path threatening and barring from god way those who believe in him desiring to make it crooked and remember when you were few and he multiplied you and behold how wa the end of the worker of corruption
Al-Araf,35,0.8934,0.0,0.719,0.281,and if there is party of you who believe in the message have been sent with and party who believe not be patient till god shall judge between u he is the best of judge
Al-Araf,40,0.4767,0.063,0.806,0.131,said the council of those of his people who waxed proud we will surely expel thee shuaib and those who believe with thee from our city unless you return into our creed he said what even though we detest it
Al-Araf,65,0.9584,0.0,0.72,0.28,we should have forged against god lie if we returned into your creed after god delivered u from it it is not for u to return into it unless god our lord so will our lord embrace all thing in his knowledge in god we have put our trust our lord give true deliverance between u and our people thou art the best of deliverer
Al-Araf,23,-0.2023,0.126,0.778,0.096,said the council of those of his people who disbelieved now if you follow shuaib assuredly in that case you will be loser
Al-Araf,14,-0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate
Al-Araf,22,-0.8225,0.323,0.677,0.0,those who cried lie to shuaib a if never they dwelt there those who cried lie to shuaib they were the loser
Al-Araf,31,0.128,0.075,0.836,0.089,so he turned his back on them and said my people have delivered to you the message of my lord and advised you sincerely how should grieve for people of unbeliever
Al-Araf,24,-0.8625,0.314,0.686,0.0,we have sent no prophet to any city but that we seized it people with misery and hardship that haply they might be humble
Al-Araf,27,-0.0516,0.185,0.635,0.18,then we gave them in the place of evil good till they multiplied and said hardship and happiness visited our father so we seized them suddenly unawares
Al-Araf,35,-0.0387,0.086,0.807,0.107,yet had the people of the city believed and been godfearing we would have opened upon them blessing from heaven and earth but they cried lie and so we seized them for what they earned
Al-Araf,21,0.34,0.0,0.893,0.107,do the people of the city feel secure our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping
Al-Araf,21,0.4939,0.0,0.819,0.181,do the people of the city feel secure our might shall not come upon them in daylight while they are playing
Al-Araf,19,0.1406,0.126,0.597,0.277,do they feel secure against god devising none feel secure against god devising but the people of the lost
Al-Araf,35,-0.5574,0.096,0.904,0.0,is it not guidance to those who inherit the earth after those who inhabited it that did we will we would smite them because of their sin sealing their heart so they do not hear
Al-Araf,40,0.2528,0.074,0.808,0.118,those city we relate to thee tidings of their messenger came to them with the clear sign but they were not the one to believe in that they had cried lie before so god seal the heart of the unbeliever
Al-Araf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,we found no covenant in the most part of them indeed we found the most part of them ungodly
Al-Araf,31,-0.631,0.122,0.878,0.0,then we sent after them moses with our sign to pharaoh and his council but they did them wrong so behold thou how wa the end of the worker of corruption
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said pharaoh am messenger from the lord of all being
Al-Araf,27,0.7172,0.056,0.705,0.239,worthy to say nothing regarding god except the truth have brought clear sign to you from your lord so send forth with me the child of israel
Al-Araf,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,said he if thou hast brought sign produce it if thou speakest truly
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he cast his staff and behold it wa serpent manifest
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,and he drew forth his hand and lo it wa white to the beholder
Al-Araf,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,said the council of the people of pharaoh surely this man is cunning sorcerer
Al-Araf,12,-0.0516,0.186,0.641,0.173,who desire to expel you from your land what do you command
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said put him and his brother off while and send among the city musterers
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
Al-Araf,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,and the sorcerer came to pharaoh saying we shall surely have wage if we should be the victor
Al-Araf,12,0.4019,0.0,0.803,0.197,he said yes indeed and you shall be among the near stationed
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses wilt thou cast or shall we be the caster
Al-Araf,25,-0.4939,0.118,0.882,0.0,he said you cast and when they cast they put spell upon the people eye and called forth fear of them and produced mighty sorcery
Al-Araf,17,-0.5267,0.175,0.825,0.0,and we revealed to moses cast thy staff and lo it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention
Al-Araf,14,0.3774,0.0,0.834,0.166,so the truth came to pas and false wa proved what they were doing
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they were vanquished there and they turned about humbled
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the sorcerer were cast down bowing themselves
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we believe in the lord of all being
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,33,-0.0516,0.111,0.811,0.078,said pharaoh you have believed in him before gave you leave surely this is device you have devised in the city that you may expel it people from it now you shall know
Al-Araf,15,0.5719,0.106,0.603,0.291,shall assuredly cut off alternately your hand and foot then shall crucify you all together
Al-Araf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,they said surely unto our lord we are turning
Al-Araf,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thou takest vengeance upon u only because we have believed in the sign of our lord when they came to u our lord pour out upon u patience and gather u unto thee surrendering
Al-Araf,45,0.7906,0.047,0.787,0.165,then said the council of the people of pharaoh wilt thou leave moses and his people to work corruption in the land and leave thee and thy god said he we shall slaughter their son and spare their woman surely we are triumphant over them
Al-Araf,36,0.8126,0.0,0.773,0.227,said moses to his people pray for succour to god and be patient surely the earth is god and he bequeaths it to whom he will among his servant the issue ultimate is to the godfearing
Al-Araf,43,-0.8591,0.211,0.751,0.039,they said we have been hurt before thou camest to u and after thou camest to u he said perchance your lord will destroy your enemy and will make you successor in the land so that he may behold how you shall do
Al-Araf,18,-0.5106,0.163,0.837,0.0,then seized we pharaoh people with year of dearth and scarcity of fruit that haply they might remember
Al-Araf,43,-0.7852,0.232,0.62,0.148,so when good came to them they said this belongs to u but if any evil smote them they would augur ill by moses and those with him why surely their ill augury wa with god but the most of them knew not
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they said whatsoever sign thou bringest to u to cast spell upon u we will not believe thee
Al-Araf,28,-0.5158,0.232,0.655,0.113,so we let loose upon them the flood and the locust the louse and the frog the blood distinct sign but they waxed proud and were sinful people
Al-Araf,45,0.765,0.0,0.84,0.16,and when the wrath fell upon them they said moses pray to thy lord for u by the covenant he ha made with thee if thou removest from u the wrath surely we will believe thee and send forth with thee the child of israel
Al-Araf,20,-0.5719,0.163,0.837,0.0,but when we removed from them the wrath unto term that they should come to lo they broke their troth
Al-Araf,24,-0.7579,0.228,0.772,0.0,so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for that they cried lie to our sign and heeded them not
Al-Araf,59,0.8832,0.045,0.764,0.191,and we bequeathed upon the people that were abased all the east and the west of the land we had blessed and perfectly wa fulfilled the most fair word of thy lord upon the child of israel for that they endured patiently and we destroyed utterly the work of pharaoh and his people and what they had been building
Al-Araf,40,0.6124,0.049,0.787,0.164,and we brought the child of israel over the sea and they came upon people cleaving to idol they had they said moses make for u god a they have god said he you are surely people who are ignorant
Al-Araf,17,0.3612,0.137,0.617,0.247,surely this they are engaged upon shall be shattered and void is what they have been doing
Al-Araf,18,0.6808,0.0,0.694,0.306,he said what shall seek god for you other than god who ha preferred you above all being
Al-Araf,33,-0.8126,0.193,0.807,0.0,and when we delivered you from the folk of pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement slaying your son and sparing your woman and in that wa grievous trial from your lord
Al-Araf,51,0.2263,0.0,0.963,0.037,and we appointed with moses thirty night and we completed them with ten so the appointed time of his lord wa forty night and moses said to his brother aaron be my successor among my people and put thing right and do not follow the way of the worker of corruption
Al-Araf,87,0.6956,0.0,0.948,0.052,and when moses came to our appointed time and his lord spoke with him he said oh my lord show me that may behold thee said he thou shalt not see me but behold the mountain if it stay fast in it place then thou shalt see me and when his lord revealed him to the mountain he made it crumble to dust and moses fell down swooning so when he awoke he said glory be to thee repent to thee am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,25,0.5719,0.0,0.866,0.134,said he moses have chosen thee above all men for my message and my utterance take what have given thee and be of the thankful
Al-Araf,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we wrote for him on the tablet of everything an admonition and distinguishing of everything so take it forcefully and command thy people to take the fairest of it shall show you the habitation of the ungodly
Al-Araf,66,-0.296,0.074,0.882,0.043,shall turn from my sign those who wax proud in the earth unjustly though they see every sign they will not believe in it and though they see the way of rectitude they will not take it for way and though they see the way of error they will take it for way that because they have cried lie to our sign and heeded them not
Al-Araf,31,-0.7506,0.181,0.819,0.0,those who cry lie to our sign and the encounter in the world to come their work have failed shall they be recompensed except according to the thing they have done
Al-Araf,42,-0.7096,0.129,0.871,0.0,and the people of moses took to them after him of their ornament calf mere body that lowed did they not see it spoke not to them neither guided them upon any way yet they took it to them and were evildoer
Al-Araf,34,0.3578,0.166,0.632,0.202,and when they smote their hand and saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord ha not mercy on u and forgives u not surely we shall be of the lost
Al-Araf,80,-0.8462,0.156,0.762,0.082,and when moses returned to his people angry and sorrowful he said evilly have you done in my place after me what have you outstripped your lord commandment and he cast down the tablet and laid hold of his brother head dragging him to him he said son of my mother surely the people have abased me and well nigh slain me make not my enemy to gloat over me and put me not among the people of the evildoer
Al-Araf,23,0.5574,0.0,0.813,0.187,he said my lord forgive me and my brother and enter u into thy mercy thou art the most merciful of the merciful
Al-Araf,28,-0.2023,0.113,0.798,0.089,surely those who took to themselves the calf anger shall overtake them from their lord and abasement in this present life so we recompense those who are forger
Al-Araf,20,0.5574,0.15,0.544,0.306,and those who do evil deed then repent thereafter and believe surely thereafter thy lord is all forgiving all compassionate
Al-Araf,30,-0.296,0.108,0.819,0.073,and when moses anger abated in him he took the tablet and in the inscription of them wa guidance and mercy unto all those who hold their lord in awe
Al-Araf,82,0.5173,0.096,0.772,0.132,and moses chose of his people seventy men for our appointed time and when the earthquake seized them he said my lord hadst thou willed thou wouldst have destroyed them before and me wilt thou destroy u for what the foolish one of u have done it is only thy trial whereby thou leadest astray whom thou wilt and guidest whom thou wilt thou art our protector so forgive u and have mercy on u for thou art the best of forgiver
Al-Araf,55,0.743,0.024,0.846,0.13,and prescribe for u in this world good and in the world to come we have repented unto thee said he my chastisement smite with it whom will and my mercy embrace all thing and shall prescribe it for those who are godfearing and pay the alms and those who indeed believe in our sign
Al-Araf,86,0.8834,0.03,0.824,0.146,those who follow the messenger the prophet of the common folk whom they find written down with them in the torah and the gospel bidding them to honour and forbidding them dishonour making lawful for them the good thing and making unlawful for them the corrupt thing and relieving them of their load and the fetter that were upon them those who believe in him and succour him and help him and follow the light that ha been sent down with him they are the prosperers
Al-Araf,67,0.1531,0.09,0.774,0.136,say mankind am the messenger of god to you all of him to whom belongs the kingdom of the heaven and of the earth there is no god but he he give life and make to die believe then in god and in his messenger the prophet of the common folk who belief in god and his word and follow him haply so you will be guided
Al-Araf,19,0.6908,0.0,0.749,0.251,of the people of moses there is nation who guide by the truth and by it act with justice
Al-Araf,81,-0.7469,0.119,0.858,0.023,and we cut them up into twelve tribe nation and we revealed to moses when his people asked him for water strike with thy staff the rock and there gushed forth from it twelve fountain all the people knew now their drinking place and we outspread the cloud to overshadow them and we sent down manna and quail upon them eat of the good thing wherewith we have supplied you and they worked no wrong upon u but themselves they wronged
Al-Araf,39,0.7783,0.0,0.799,0.201,and when it wa said to them dwell in this township and eat of it wherever you will and say unburdening and enter in at the gate prostrating we will forgive you your transgression and increase the good doer
Al-Araf,29,-0.7096,0.219,0.693,0.088,then the evildoer of them substituted saying other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon them wrath out of heaven for their evildoing
Al-Araf,52,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and question them concerning the township which wa bordering the sea when they transgressed the sabbath when their fish came to them on the day of their sabbath swimming shorewards but on the day they kept not sabbath they came not unto them even so we were trying them for their ungodliness
Al-Araf,37,-0.765,0.221,0.658,0.121,and when certain nation of them said why do you admonish people god is about to destroy or to chastise with terrible chastisement they said a an excuse to your lord and haply they will be godfearing
Al-Araf,27,-0.9382,0.387,0.613,0.0,so when they forgot that they were reminded of we delivered those who were forbidding wickedness and we seized the evildoer with evil chastisement for their ungodliness
Al-Araf,18,-0.8442,0.378,0.622,0.0,and when they turned in disdain from that forbidding we said to them be you ape miserably slinking
Al-Araf,38,0.8074,0.088,0.639,0.273,and when thy lord proclaimed he would send forth against them unto the day of resurrection those who should visit them with evil chastisement surely thy lord is swift in retribution surely he is all forgiving all compassionate
Al-Araf,33,-0.5574,0.165,0.761,0.074,and we cut them up into nation in the earth some of them righteous and some of them otherwise and we tried them with good thing and evil that haply they should return
Al-Araf,84,0.8958,0.043,0.738,0.22,and there succeeded after them succession who inherited the book taking the chance good of this lower world and saying it will be forgiven u and if chance good the like of them come to them they will take them ha not the compact of the book been taken touching them that they should say concerning god nothing but the truth and they have studied what is in it and the last abode is better for those who are godfearing do you not understand
Al-Araf,25,0.6164,0.042,0.774,0.184,and those who hold fast to the book and perform the prayer surely we leave not to waste the wage of those who set aright
Al-Araf,41,-0.1027,0.035,0.965,0.0,and when we shook the mountain above them a if it were canopy and they supposed it wa about to fall on them take forcefully what we have given you and remember what is in it haply you will be godfearing
Al-Araf,47,0.4019,0.0,0.942,0.058,and when thy lord took from the child of adam from their loin their seed and made them testify touching themselves am not your lord they said yes we testify lest you should say on the day of resurrection a for u we were heedless of this
Al-Araf,28,-0.743,0.201,0.799,0.0,or lest you say our father were idolater aforetime and we were seed after them what wilt thou then destroy u for the deed of the vain doer
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we distinguish the sign and haply they will return
Al-Araf,31,-0.6652,0.129,0.871,0.0,and recite to them the tiding of him to whom we gave our sign but he cast them off and satan followed after him and he became one of the pervert
Al-Araf,70,-0.5267,0.048,0.952,0.0,and had we willed we would have raised him up thereby but he inclined towards the earth and followed his lust so the likeness of him is a the likeness of dog if thou attackest it it lolls it tongue out or if thou leavest it it lolls it tongue out that is that people likeness who cried lie to our sign so relate the story haply they will reflect
Al-Araf,19,-0.7906,0.292,0.708,0.0,an evil likeness is the likeness of the people who cried lie to our sign and themselves were wronging
Al-Araf,16,-0.3182,0.174,0.718,0.108,whomsoever god guide he is rightly guided and whom he lead astray they are the loser
Al-Araf,49,0.5789,0.0,0.908,0.092,we have created for gehenna many jinni and men they have heart but understand not with them they have eye but perceive not with them they have ear but they hear not with them they are like cattle nay rather they are further astray those they are the heedless
Al-Araf,29,0.8268,0.034,0.712,0.253,to god belong the name most beautiful so call him by them and leave those who blaspheme his name they shall assuredly be recompensed for the thing they did
Al-Araf,17,0.7717,0.0,0.645,0.355,of those we created are nation who guide by the truth and by it act with justice
Al-Araf,20,-0.4767,0.14,0.86,0.0,and those who cry lie to our sign we will draw them on little by little whence they know not
Al-Araf,8,0.5994,0.0,0.55,0.45,and respite them assuredly my guile is sure
Al-Araf,16,0.284,0.0,0.816,0.184,have they not reflected no madness is in their comrade he is naught but plain warner
Al-Araf,41,0.8316,0.0,0.791,0.209,or have they not considered the dominion of the heaven and of the earth and what thing god ha created and that it may be their term is already nigh in what manner of discourse then will they after this believe
Al-Araf,16,0.3182,0.112,0.66,0.228,whomsoever god lead astray no guide he ha he leaf them in their insolence blindly wandering
Al-Araf,74,0.8674,0.0,0.878,0.122,they will question thee concerning the hour when it shall berth say the knowledge of it is only with my lord none shall reveal it at it proper time but he heavy is it in the heaven and the earth it will not come on you but suddenly they will question thee a though thou art well informed of it say the knowledge of it is only with god but most men know not
Al-Araf,42,0.34,0.176,0.605,0.219,say have no power to profit for myself or hurt but a god will had knowledge of the unseen would have acquired much good and evil would not have touched me am only warner and bearer of good tidings to people believing
Al-Araf,61,0.5187,0.098,0.771,0.131,it is he who created you out of one living soul and made of him his spouse that he might rest in her then when he covered her she bore light burden and passed by with it but when it became heavy they cried to god their lord if thou givest u righteous son we indeed shall be of the thankful
Al-Araf,26,0.3919,0.0,0.904,0.096,thereafter when he gave them righteous son they assigned him associate in that he had given them but god is high exalted above that they associate
Al-Araf,12,0.4767,0.0,0.709,0.291,what do they associate that which creates nothing and themselves are created

Yusuf,25,-0.327,0.174,0.73,0.096,he said my son relate not thy vision to thy brother lest they devise against thee some guile surely satan is to man manifest enemy
Yusuf,44,0.9485,0.0,0.696,0.304,so will thy lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of tale and perfect his blessing upon thee and upon the house of jacob a he perfected it formerly on thy father abraham and isaac surely thy lord is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in joseph and his brother were sign for those who ask question
Yusuf,26,0.7184,0.081,0.659,0.26,when they said surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are band surely our father is in manifest error
Yusuf,26,-0.34,0.147,0.75,0.103,kill you joseph or cast him forth into some land that your father face may be free for you and thereafter you may be righteous people
Yusuf,28,-0.5346,0.146,0.854,0.0,one of them said no kill not joseph but cast him into the bottom of the pit and some traveller will pick him out if you do aught
Yusuf,20,0.3387,0.104,0.689,0.207,they said father what ail thee that thou trustest u not with joseph surely we are his sincere well wishers
Yusuf,17,0.6486,0.0,0.725,0.275,send him forth with u tomorrow to frolic and play surely we shall be watching over him
Yusuf,24,-0.7506,0.225,0.775,0.0,he said it grief me that you should go with him and fear the wolf may eat him while you are heedless of him
Yusuf,14,-0.5267,0.207,0.793,0.0,they said if the wolf eats him and we band then are we loser
Yusuf,34,0.34,0.049,0.838,0.114,so when they went with him and agreed to put him in the bottom of the well and we revealed to him thou shalt tell them of this their doing when they are unaware
Yusuf,13,-0.4404,0.195,0.805,0.0,and they came to their father in the evening and they were weeping
Yusuf,29,0.5927,0.0,0.875,0.125,they said father we went running race and left joseph behind with our thing so the wolf ate him but thou wouldst never believe u though we spoke truly
Yusuf,37,0.772,0.037,0.769,0.194,and they brought his shirt with false blood on it he said no but your spirit tempted you to do somewhat but come sweet patience and god succour is ever there to seek against that you describe
Yusuf,37,0.5041,0.034,0.847,0.118,then came traveller and they sent one of them water drawer who let down his bucket good news he said here is young man so they hid him a merchandise but god knew what they were doing
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they sold him for paltry price handful of counted dirham for they set small store by him
Yusuf,60,0.3612,0.0,0.942,0.058,he that bought him being of egypt said to his wife give him goodly lodging and it may be that he will profit u or we may take him for our own son so we established joseph in the land and that we might teach him the interpretation of tale god prevails in his purpose but most men know not
Yusuf,19,0.4404,0.0,0.861,0.139,and when he wa fully grown we gave him judgment and knowledge even so we recompense the good doer
Yusuf,41,0.6369,0.081,0.714,0.204,now the woman in whose house he wa solicited him and closed the door on them come she said take me god be my refuge he said surely my lord ha given me goodly lodging surely the evildoer do not prosper
Yusuf,39,-0.4588,0.129,0.763,0.108,for she desired him and he would have taken her but that he saw the proof of his lord so wa it that we might turn away from him evil and abomination he wa one of our devoted servant
Yusuf,42,-0.8898,0.213,0.787,0.0,they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind they encountered her master by the door she said what is the recompense of him who purpose evil against thy folk but that he should be imprisoned or painful chastisement
Yusuf,35,0.1027,0.166,0.659,0.175,said he it wa she that solicited me and witness of her folk bore witness if his shirt ha been torn from before then she ha spoken truly and he is one of the liar
Yusuf,23,0.6486,0.173,0.528,0.299,but if it be that his shirt ha been torn from behind then she ha lied and he is one of the truthful
Yusuf,22,0.7184,0.071,0.679,0.25,when he saw his shirt wa torn from behind he said this is of your woman guile surely your guile is great
Yusuf,20,0.128,0.137,0.667,0.196,joseph turn away from this and thou woman ask forgiveness of thy crime surely thou art one of the sinner
Yusuf,28,0.7184,0.076,0.678,0.246,certain woman that were in the city said the governor wife ha been soliciting her page he smote her heart with love we see her in manifest error
Yusuf,61,0.8545,0.068,0.73,0.202,when she heard their sly whisper she sent to them and made ready for them repast then she gave to each one of them knife come forth attend to them she said and when they saw him they so admired him that they cut their hand saying god save u this is no mortal he is no other but noble angel
Yusuf,38,-0.6369,0.141,0.816,0.043,so now you see she said this is he you blamed me for yes solicited him but he abstained yet if he will not do what command him he shall be imprisoned and be one of the humbled
Yusuf,36,-0.3612,0.131,0.799,0.07,he said my lord prison is dearer to me than that they call me to yet if thou turnest not from me their guile then shall yearn towards them and so become one of the ignorant
Yusuf,22,0.4404,0.0,0.879,0.121,so his lord answered him and he turned away from him their guile surely he is the all hearing the all knowing
Yusuf,19,0.4404,0.0,0.861,0.139,then it seemed good to them after they had seen the sign that they should imprison him for while
Yusuf,47,-0.1027,0.066,0.876,0.058,and there entered the prison with him two youth said one of them dreamed that wa pressing grape said the other dreamed that wa carrying on my head bread that bird were eating of tell u it interpretation we see that thou art of the good doer
Yusuf,54,0.7783,0.027,0.833,0.14,he said no food shall come to you for your sustenance but ere it come to you shall tell you it interpretation that shall tell you is of what god ha taught me have forsaken the creed of people who believe not in god and who moreover are unbeliever in the world to come
Yusuf,37,-0.4399,0.1,0.823,0.077,and have followed the creed of my father abraham isaac and jacob not ours is it to associate aught with god that is of god bounty to u and to men but most men are not thankful
Yusuf,17,0.3818,0.148,0.551,0.301,say which is better my fellow prisoner many god at variance or god the one the omnipotent
Yusuf,52,0.8462,0.045,0.745,0.21,that which you serve apart from him is nothing but name yourselves have named you and your father god ha sent down no authority touching them judgment belongs only to god he ha commanded that you shall not serve any but him that is the right religion but most men know not
Yusuf,36,-0.5267,0.096,0.874,0.03,fellow prisoner a for one of you he shall pour wine for his lord a for the other he shall be crucified and bird will eat of his head the matter is decided whereon you enquire
Yusuf,42,-0.5023,0.138,0.77,0.092,then he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two mention me in thy lord presence but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master so that he continued in the prison for certain year
Yusuf,39,0.6124,0.0,0.857,0.143,and the king said saw in dream seven fat kine and seven lean one devouring them likewise seven green ear of corn and seven withered my counsellor pronounce to me upon my dream if you are expounder of dream
Yusuf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,hotchpotch of nightmare they said we know nothing of the interpretation of nightmare
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then said the one who had been delivered remembering after time will myself tell you it interpretation so send me forth
Yusuf,35,0.4215,0.0,0.922,0.078,joseph thou true man pronounce to u regarding seven fat kine that seven lean one were devouring seven green ear of corn and seven withered haply shall return to the men haply they will know
Yusuf,23,-0.0516,0.052,0.948,0.0,he said you shall sow seven year after your wont what you have harvested leave in the ear excepting little whereof you eat

Al-Kahf,56,-0.872,0.236,0.634,0.13,say the truth is from your lord so let whosoever will believe and let whosoever will disbelieve surely we have prepared for the evildoer fire whose pavilion encompasses them if they call for succour they will be succoured with water like molten copper that shall scald their face how evil potion and how evil resting place
Al-Kahf,23,0.8699,0.04,0.595,0.365,surely those who believe and do deed of righteousness surely we leave not to waste the wage of him who doe good work
Al-Kahf,44,0.8689,0.033,0.747,0.22,those theirs shall be garden of eden underneath which river flow therein they shall be adorned with bracelet of gold and they shall be robed in green garment of silk and brocade therein reclining upon couch how excellent reward and how fair resting place
Al-Kahf,30,-0.128,0.049,0.951,0.0,and strike for them similitude two men to one of them we assigned two garden of vine and surrounded them with palm tree and between them we set sown field
Al-Kahf,22,-0.0516,0.125,0.758,0.117,each of the two garden yielded it produce and failed naught in any wise and we caused to gush amidst them river
Al-Kahf,30,0.7624,0.0,0.804,0.196,so he had fruit and he said to his fellow a he wa conversing with him have more abundance of wealth than thou and am mightier in respect of men

Al-Kahf,23,0.7003,0.0,0.784,0.216,do not think that the hour is coming and if am indeed returned to my lord shall surely find better resort than this
Al-Kahf,28,-0.0258,0.075,0.854,0.071,said his fellow a he wa conversing with him what disbelievest thou in him who created thee of dust then of sperm drop then shaped thee a man
Al-Kahf,16,0.3919,0.0,0.85,0.15,but lo he is god my lord and will not associate with my lord any one
Al-Kahf,34,-0.1601,0.153,0.763,0.084,why when thou wentest into thy garden didst thou not say a god will there is no power except in god if thou seest me that am le than thou in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,33,0.5994,0.06,0.779,0.161,yet it may be that my lord will give me better than thy garden and loose on it thunderbolt out of heaven so that in the morning it will be slope of dust
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or in the morning the water of it will be sunk into the earth so that thou wilt not be able to seek it out
Al-Kahf,43,0.1779,0.054,0.878,0.069,and his fruit wa all encompassed and in the morning he wa wringing his hand for that he had expended upon it and it wa fallen down upon it trellis and he wa saying would had not associated with my lord any one
Al-Kahf,15,-0.1531,0.283,0.458,0.258,but there wa no host to help him apart from god and he wa helpless
Al-Kahf,16,0.9493,0.0,0.397,0.603,thereover protection belongs only to god the true he is best rewarding best in the issue
Al-Kahf,46,0.5994,0.031,0.859,0.11,and strike for them the similitude of the present life it is a water that we send down out of heaven and the plant of the earth mingle with it and in the morning it is straw the wind scatter and god is omnipotent over everything
Al-Kahf,28,0.9719,0.0,0.477,0.523,wealth and son are the adornment of the present world but the abiding thing the deed of righteousness are better with god in reward and better in hope

Al-Kahf,60,-0.6705,0.161,0.725,0.114,and when we said to the angel bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he wa one of the jinni and committed ungodliness against his lord command what and do you take him and his seed to be your friend apart from me and they an enemy to you how evil is that exchange for the evildoer
Al-Kahf,31,0.8225,0.0,0.738,0.262,made them not witness of the creation of the heaven and earth neither of the creation of themselves would not ever take those who lead others astray to be my supporter

Al-Kahf,24,-0.7906,0.286,0.658,0.056,then the evildoer will see the fire and think that they are about to fall into it and will find no escape from it
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we have indeed turned about for men in this koran every manner of similitude man is the most disputatious of thing
Al-Kahf,39,0.1531,0.0,0.934,0.066,and naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came unto them and seeking their lord forgiveness but that the wont of the ancient should come upon them or that the chastisement should come upon them face to face
Al-Kahf,40,-0.6652,0.231,0.641,0.128,and we send not the envoy but good tidings to bear and warning yet do the unbeliever dispute with falsehood that they may rebut thereby the truth they have taken my sign and what they are warned of in mockery
Al-Kahf,59,0.4939,0.065,0.809,0.126,and who doe greater evil than he who being reminded of the sign of his lord turn away from them and forgets what his hand have forwarded surely we have laid veil on their heart lest they understand it and in their ear heaviness and though thou callest them to the guidance yet they will not be guided ever
Al-Kahf,40,0.7469,0.058,0.751,0.191,but thy lord is the all forgiving full of mercy if he should take them to task for that they have earned he would hasten for them the chastisement but they have tryst from which they will find no escape
Al-Kahf,16,-0.9062,0.465,0.535,0.0,and those city we destroyed them when they did evil and appointed for their destruction tryst
Al-Kahf,25,0.0258,0.0,0.956,0.044,and when moses said to his page will not give up until reach the meeting of the two sea though go on for many year

Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he this is what we were seeking and so they returned upon their track retracing them
Al-Kahf,24,0.3612,0.0,0.894,0.106,then they found one of our servant unto whom we had given mercy from u and we had taught him knowledge proceeding from u
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said to him shall follow thee so that thou teachest me of what thou hast been taught right judgment

Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he then if thou followest me question me not on anything until myself introduce the mention of it to thee
Al-Kahf,36,-0.7893,0.175,0.825,0.0,so they departed until when they embarked upon the ship he made hole in it he said what hast thou made hole in it so a to drown it passenger thou hast indeed done grievous thing
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he did not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently
Al-Kahf,18,-0.3612,0.128,0.872,0.0,he said do not take me to task that forgot neither constrain me to do thing too difficult
Al-Kahf,33,-0.2732,0.095,0.84,0.065,so they departed until when they met lad he slew him he said what hast thou slain soul innocent and that not to retaliate for soul slain thou hast indeed done horrible thing
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he did not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently

Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he this is the parting between me and thee now will tell thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently
Al-Kahf,34,-0.802,0.244,0.657,0.099,a for the ship it belonged to certain poor men who toiled upon the sea and desired to damage it for behind them there wa king who wa seizing every ship by brutal force
Al-Kahf,20,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,a for the lad his parent were believer and we were afraid he would impose on them insolence and unbelief
Al-Kahf,22,0.7951,0.0,0.702,0.298,so we desired that their lord should give to them in exchange one better than he in purity and nearer in tenderness
Al-Kahf,65,0.7906,0.0,0.868,0.132,a for the wall it belonged to two orphan lad in the city and under it wa treasure belonging to them their father wa righteous man and thy lord desired that they should come of age and then bring forth their treasure a mercy from thy lord did it not of my own bidding this is the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently

Al-Kahf,26,-0.9393,0.41,0.59,0.0,he said a for the evildoer him we shall chastise then he shall be returned to his lord and he shall chastise him with horrible chastisement
Al-Kahf,28,0.9159,0.0,0.66,0.34,but a for him who belief and doe righteousness he shall receive a recompense the reward most fair and we shall speak to him of our command easiness

An-Naml,30,0.34,0.0,0.924,0.076,have only been commanded to serve the lord of this territory which he ha made sacred to him belongs everything and have been commanded to be of those that surrender
An-Naml,25,0.296,0.0,0.916,0.084,and to recite the koran so whosoever is guided is only guided to his own gain and whosoever go astray say am naught but warner
An-Naml,27,0.6908,0.0,0.814,0.186,and say praise belongs to god he shall show you his sign and you will recognise them thy lord is not heedless of the thing you do
Al-Qasas,3,-0.5574,0.643,0.357,0.0,ta sin mim
Al-Qasas,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those are the sign of the manifest book
Al-Qasas,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,we will recite to thee something of the tiding of moses and pharaoh truthfully for people who believe
Al-Qasas,35,0.4019,0.0,0.926,0.074,now pharaoh had exalted himself in the land and had divided it inhabitant into sect abasing one party of them slaughtering their son and sparing their woman for he wa of the worker of corruption
Al-Qasas,25,0.6908,0.0,0.801,0.199,yet we desired to be gracious to those that were abased in the land and to make them leader and to make them the inheritor
Al-Qasas,23,-0.25,0.127,0.784,0.09,and to establish them in the land and to show pharaoh and ha man and their host what they were dreading from them
Al-Qasas,40,0.0807,0.054,0.885,0.061,so we revealed to moses mother suckle him then when thou fearest for him cast him into the sea and do not fear neither sorrow for we shall return him to thee and shall appoint him one of the envoy
Al-Qasas,28,-0.6705,0.201,0.729,0.07,so then the folk of pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy and sorrow to them certainly pharaoh and haman and their host were of the sinner
Al-Qasas,31,0.6597,0.0,0.838,0.162,said pharaoh wife he will be comfort to me and thee slay him not perchance he will profit u or we will take him for son and they were not aware
Al-Qasas,28,-0.4822,0.137,0.863,0.0,on the morrow the heart of moses mother became empty and she wellnigh disclosed him had we not strengthened her heart that she might be among the believer
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to his sister follow him and she perceived him from afar even while they were not aware
Al-Qasas,37,-0.4215,0.072,0.928,0.0,now we had forbidden to him aforetime to be suckled by any foster mother therefore she said shall direct you to the people of household who will take charge of him for you and look after him
Al-Qasas,34,0.7085,0.0,0.765,0.235,so we returned him to his mother that she might be comforted and not sorrow and that she might know that the promise of god is true but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,27,0.8689,0.0,0.71,0.29,and when he wa fully grown and in the perfection of his strength we gave him judgment and knowledge even so do we recompense the good doer
Al-Qasas,75,-0.9058,0.219,0.692,0.088,and he entered the city at time when it people were unheeding and found there two men fighting the one wa of his own party and the other wa of his enemy then the one that wa of his party cried to him to aid him against the other that wa of his enemy so moses struck him and despatched him and said this is of satan doing he is surely an enemy misleading manifest
Al-Qasas,22,0.8545,0.09,0.497,0.413,he said my lord have wronged myself forgive me so god forgave him for he is the all forgiving the all compassionate
Al-Qasas,17,0.5994,0.0,0.794,0.206,he said my lord forasmuch a thou hast blessed me will never be partisan of the sinner
Al-Qasas,38,-0.34,0.131,0.769,0.1,now in the morning he wa in the city fearful and vigilant and behold the man who had sought his succour on the day before cried out to him again moses said to him clearly thou art quarreller
Al-Qasas,52,-0.7783,0.154,0.788,0.058,but when he would have assaulted the man who wa an enemy to them both the man said moses dost thou desire to slay me even a thou slewest living soul yesterday thou only desirest to be tyrant in the land thou desirest not to be of them that put thing right
Al-Qasas,28,0.4019,0.0,0.909,0.091,then came man from the furthest part of the city running he said moses the council are conspiring to slay thee depart am one of thy sincere adviser
Al-Qasas,19,-0.765,0.292,0.64,0.068,so he departed therefrom fearful and vigilant he said my lord deliver me from the people of the evildoer
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he turned his face towards midian he said it may be that my lord will guide me
Al-Qasas,58,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on the right way and when he came to the water of midian he found company of the people there drawing water and he found apart from them two woman holding back their flock he said what is your business they said we may not draw water until the shepherd drive off and our father is passing old
Al-Qasas,31,0.7003,0.0,0.833,0.167,so he drew water for them then he turned away to the shade and he said my lord surely have need of whatever good thou shalt have sent down upon me
Al-Qasas,58,-0.5423,0.068,0.906,0.026,then came one of the two woman to him walking modestly and said my father invite thee that he may recompense thee with the wage of thy drawing water for u so when he came to him and had related to him the story he said be not afraid thou hast escaped from the people of the evildoer
Al-Qasas,22,0.9274,0.0,0.57,0.43,said one of the two woman father hire him surely the best man thou canst hire is the one strong and trusty
Al-Qasas,55,0.8271,0.023,0.813,0.164,he said desire to marry thee to one of these my two daughter on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for eight year if thou completest ten that shall be of thy own accord do not desire to press hard upon thee thou shalt assuredly find me if god will one of the righteous
Al-Qasas,31,-0.5859,0.164,0.778,0.058,said he so let it be between me and thee whichever of the two term fulfil it shall be no injustice to me and god is guardian of what we say
Al-Qasas,49,-0.7783,0.195,0.724,0.081,so when moses had accomplished the term and departed with his household he observed on the side of the mount fire he said to his household tarry you here observe fire perhaps shall bring you news of it or faggot from the fire that haply you shall warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,29,-0.128,0.082,0.852,0.066,when he came to it voice cried from the right of the watercourse in the sacred hollow coming from the tree moses am god the lord of all being
Al-Qasas,32,-0.1793,0.146,0.727,0.127,cast down thy staff and when he saw it quivering like serpent he turned about retreating and turned not back moses come forward and fear not for surely thou art in security
Al-Qasas,46,0.863,0.0,0.817,0.183,insert thy hand into thy bosom and it will come forth white without evil and press to thee thy arm that thou be not afraid so these shall be two proof from thy lord to pharaoh and his council for surely they are an ungodly people
Al-Qasas,18,-0.4939,0.158,0.842,0.0,said he my lord have indeed slain living soul among them and fear that they will slay me
Al-Qasas,26,-0.25,0.193,0.644,0.163,moreover my brother aaron is more eloquent than send him with me a helper and to confirm speak truly for fear they will cry me lie
Al-Qasas,40,0.3666,0.026,0.888,0.086,said he we will strengthen thy arm by mean of thy brother and we shall appoint to you an authority so that they shall not reach you because of our sign you and whoso follows you shall be the victor
Al-Qasas,29,0.2023,0.0,0.94,0.06,so when moses came to them with our sign clear sign they said this is nothing but forged sorcery we never heard of this among our father the ancient
Al-Qasas,27,0.0745,0.154,0.656,0.19,but moses said my lord know very well who come with the guidance from him and shall posse the ultimate abode surely the evildoer will not prosper
Al-Qasas,40,-0.6542,0.158,0.754,0.088,and pharaoh said council know not that you have any god but me kindle me haman fire upon the clay and make me tower that may mount up to moses god for think that he is one of the liar
Al-Qasas,22,0.4767,0.0,0.866,0.134,and he waxed proud in the land he and his host wrongfully and they thought they should not be returned to u
Al-Qasas,22,-0.6249,0.163,0.837,0.0,therefore we seized him and his host and cast their into the sea so behold how wa the end of the evildoer
Al-Qasas,20,-0.34,0.112,0.888,0.0,and we appointed them leader calling to the fire and on the day of resurrection they shall not be helped
Al-Qasas,21,-0.5423,0.149,0.851,0.0,and we pursued them in this world with curse and on the day of resurrection they shall be among the spurned
Al-Qasas,27,-0.1779,0.104,0.814,0.081,and we gave moses the book after that we had destroyed the former generation to be example and guidance and mercy that haply so they might remember
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thou wast not upon the western side when we decreed to moses the commandment nor wast thou of those witnessing
Al-Qasas,27,-0.0857,0.049,0.951,0.0,but we raised up generation and long their life continued neither wast thou dweller among the midianites reciting to them our sign but we were sending messenger
Al-Qasas,36,-0.0387,0.108,0.812,0.08,thou wast not upon the side of the mount when we called but for mercy from thy lord that thou mayest warn people to whom no warner came before thee and that haply they may remember
Al-Qasas,39,0.4939,0.0,0.92,0.08,else did an affliction visit them for that their own hand have forwarded then they might say our lord why didst thou not send messenger to u that we might follow thy sign and so be among the believer
Al-Qasas,51,0.8913,0.0,0.768,0.232,yet when the truth came to them from ourselves they said why ha he not been given the like of that moses wa given but they did they not disbelieve also in what moses wa given aforetime they said pair of sorcery mutually supporting each other they said we disbelieve both
Al-Qasas,18,0.7845,0.0,0.655,0.345,say bring book from god that give better guidance than these and follow it if you speak truly
Al-Qasas,39,-0.5897,0.169,0.767,0.064,then if they do not answer thee know that they are only following their caprice and who is further astray than he who follows his caprice without guidance from god surely god guide not the people of the evildoer
Al-Qasas,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,now we have brought them the word haply they may remember
Al-Qasas,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the book before this believe in it
Al-Qasas,28,0.6369,0.0,0.833,0.167,and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it surely it is the truth from our lord indeed even before it we had surrendered
Al-Qasas,26,-0.4939,0.191,0.719,0.091,these shall be given their wage twice over for that they patiently endured and avert evil with good and expend of that we have provided them
Al-Qasas,29,0.7914,0.0,0.764,0.236,when they hear idle talk they turn away from it and say we have our deed and you your deed peace be upon your we desire not the ignorant
Al-Qasas,20,0.6946,0.0,0.758,0.242,thou guidest not whom thou likest but god guide whom he will and know very well those that are guided
Al-Qasas,42,0.1779,0.0,0.958,0.042,they say should we follow the guidance with thee we shall be snatched from our land have we not established for them sanctuary secure to which are collected the fruit of everything a provision from u but most of them know not
Al-Qasas,26,-0.1531,0.107,0.772,0.121,how many city we have destroyed that flourished in insolent ease those are their dwelling place undwelt in after them except little ourselves are the inheritor
Al-Qasas,33,0.5197,0.099,0.698,0.203,yet thy lord never destroyed the city until he sent in their mother city messenger to recite our sign unto them and we never destroyed the city save that their inhabitant were evildoer
Al-Qasas,26,0.872,0.0,0.669,0.331,whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life and it adornment and what is with god is better and more enduring
Al-Qasas,44,0.9042,0.0,0.747,0.253,will you not understand what is he to whom we have promised fair promise and he receives it like him to whom we have given the enjoyment of the present life then he on the resurrection day shall be of those that are arraigned
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associate whom you were asserting
Al-Qasas,38,-0.6597,0.164,0.775,0.061,those against whom the word is realized they shall say our lord those whom we perverted we perverted them even a we ourselves erred we declare our innocence unto thee it wa not u that they were serving
Al-Qasas,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it shall be said call you now upon your associate and they will call upon them but they shall not answer them and they shall see the chastisement ah if they had been guided
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say what answer gave you to the envoy
Al-Qasas,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,upon that day the tidings will be darkened for them nor will they ask each other
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but a for him who repents and belief and work righteousness haply he shall be among the prosperers
Al-Qasas,26,0.09,0.095,0.765,0.14,thy lord creates whatsoever he will and he chooses they have not the choice glory be to god high be he exalted above that they associate
Al-Qasas,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thy lord know what their breast conceal and what they publish
Al-Qasas,33,0.7506,0.043,0.745,0.213,and he is god there is no god but he his is the praise in the former a in the latter his too is the judgment and unto him you shall be returned
Al-Qasas,31,0.6486,0.0,0.816,0.184,say what think you if god should make the night unceasing over you until the day of resurrection what god other than god shall bring you illumination will you not hear
Al-Qasas,34,0.6486,0.0,0.831,0.169,say what think you if god should make the day unceasing over you until the day of resurrection what god other than god shall bring you night to repose in will you not see
Al-Qasas,27,0.8225,0.0,0.736,0.264,of his mercy he ha appointed for you night and day for you to repose in and seek after his bounty that haply you will be thankful
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associate whom you were asserting
Al-Qasas,33,0.5267,0.0,0.876,0.124,and we shall draw out from every nation witness and say produce your proof then will they know that truth is god and there shall go astray from them that they were forging
Al-Qasas,52,-0.3983,0.134,0.777,0.089,now korah wa of the people of moses he became insolent to them for we had given him treasure such that the very key of them were too heavy burden for company of men endowed with strength when his people said to him do not exult god love not those that exult
Al-Qasas,48,0.9836,0.033,0.522,0.445,but seek amidst that which god ha given thee the last abode and forget not thy portion of the present world and do good a god ha been good to thee and seek not to work corruption in the earth surely god love not the worker of corruption
Al-Qasas,50,-0.9005,0.241,0.696,0.063,he said what have been given is only because of knowledge that is in me what did he not know that god bad destroyed before him generation of men stronger than he ill might and more numerous in multitude and yet the sinner shall not be questioned concerning their sin
Al-Qasas,36,0.8807,0.0,0.718,0.282,so he went forth unto his people in his adornment those who desired the present life said would that we possessed the like of that korah ha been given surely he is man of mighty fortune
Al-Qasas,33,0.8847,0.081,0.612,0.307,but those to whom knowledge had been given said woe upon you the reward of god is better for him who belief and work righteousness and none shall receive it except the steadfast
Al-Qasas,26,-0.0772,0.162,0.654,0.184,so we made the earth to swallow him and his dwelling and there wa no host to help him apart from god and he wa helpless
Al-Qasas,54,0.0711,0.052,0.873,0.075,and in the morning those who had longed to be in his place the day before were saying ah god outspreads and straitens his provision to whomsoever he will of his servant had god not been gracious to u he would have made u to be swallowed too ah the unbeliever do not prosper
Al-Qasas,26,0.4019,0.0,0.903,0.097,that is the last abode we appoint it for those who desire not exorbitance in the earth nor corruption the issue ultimate is to the godfearing
Al-Qasas,30,-0.6124,0.217,0.64,0.143,whoso brings good deed shall have better than it and whoso brings an evil deed those who have done evil deed shall only be recompensed for that they were doing
Al-Qasas,31,0.5413,0.107,0.693,0.2,he who imposed the recitation upon thee shall surely restore thee to place of homing say my lord know very well who come with guidance and who is in manifest error
Al-Qasas,28,0.0243,0.08,0.836,0.084,thou didst not hope that the book should be cast unto thee except it be a mercy from thy lord so be thou not partisan of the unbeliever
Al-Qasas,31,0.2732,0.0,0.935,0.065,let them not bar thee from the sign of god after that they have been sent down to thee and call upon thy lord and be thou not of the idolater
Al-Qasas,31,-0.4255,0.177,0.823,0.0,and call not upon another god with god there is no god but he all thing perish except his face his is the judgment and unto him you shall be returned
Al-Ankabut,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,alif lam mim

Al-Ankabut,22,0.8074,0.103,0.502,0.395,we certainly tried those that were before them and assuredly god know those who speak truly and assuredly he know the liar
Al-Ankabut,17,-0.802,0.34,0.66,0.0,or do they reckon those who do evil deed that they will outstrip u ill they judge
Al-Ankabut,17,0.4939,0.0,0.781,0.219,whoso look to encounter god god term is coming he is the all hearing the all knowing
Al-Ankabut,17,0.5859,0.184,0.48,0.336,whosoever struggle struggle only to his own gain surely god is all sufficient nor need any being
Al-Ankabut,28,0.5423,0.118,0.643,0.239,and those who believe and do righteous deed we shall surely acquit them of their evil deed and shall recompense them the best of what they were doing
Al-Ankabut,47,-0.25,0.083,0.873,0.044,we have charged man that he be kind to his parent but if they strive with thee to make thee associate with me that whereof thou hast no knowledge then do not obey them unto me you shall return and shall tell you what you were doing
Al-Ankabut,16,0.5267,0.0,0.761,0.239,and those who believe and do righteous deed assuredly we shall admit them among the righteous
Al-Ankabut,59,0.8604,0.064,0.711,0.225,some men there are who say we believe in god but when such man is hurt in god cause he make the persecution of men a it were god chastisement then if help come from thy lord he will say we were with you what doe not god know very well what is in the breast of all being
Al-Ankabut,10,0.6124,0.0,0.615,0.385,god surely know the believer and he know the hypocrite
Al-Ankabut,29,-0.5859,0.223,0.694,0.084,the unbeliever say to the believer follow our path and let u carry your offence yet they cannot carry anything even of their own offence they are truly liar
Al-Ankabut,29,0.5994,0.043,0.795,0.162,they shall certainly carry their load and other load along with their load and upon the day of resurrection they shall surely be questioned concerning that they were forging
Al-Ankabut,26,-0.7684,0.184,0.816,0.0,indeed we sent noah to his people and he tarried among them thousand year all but fifty so the flood seized them while they were evildoer
Al-Ankabut,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,yet we delivered him and those who were in the ship and appointed it for sign unto all being
Al-Ankabut,21,0.2023,0.122,0.687,0.191,and abraham when he said to his people serve god and fear him that is better for you did you know
Al-Ankabut,45,0.836,0.041,0.732,0.227,you only serve apart from god idol and you create calumny those you serve apart from god have no power to provide for you so seek after your provision with god and serve him and be thankful to him unto him you shall be returned
Al-Ankabut,23,-0.8201,0.264,0.736,0.0,but if you cry me lie nation cried lie before you and it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
Al-Ankabut,21,0.6566,0.131,0.543,0.326,have they not seen how god originates creation then brings it back again surely that is an easy matter for god
Al-Ankabut,24,0.8658,0.0,0.619,0.381,say journey in the land then behold how he originated creation then god cause the second growth to grow god is powerful over everything
Al-Ankabut,18,-0.0516,0.127,0.755,0.118,chastising whom he will and having mercy on whomsoever he will and unto him you shall be turned
Al-Ankabut,25,0.7481,0.059,0.678,0.264,you are not able to frustrate him either in the earth or in heaven and you have not apart from god either protector or helper
Al-Ankabut,23,-0.3612,0.244,0.561,0.195,and those who disbelieve in god sign and the encounter with him they despair of my mercy and there awaits them painful chastisement
Al-Ankabut,32,0.5267,0.08,0.751,0.168,but the only answer of his people wa that they said slay him or burn him then god delivered him from the fire surely in that are sign for people who believe
Al-Ankabut,54,-0.2023,0.161,0.706,0.133,and he said you have only taken to yourselves idol apart from god a mark of mutual love between you in the present life then upon the day of resurrection you will deny one another and you will curse one another and your refuge will be the fire and you will have no helper
Al-Ankabut,20,0.631,0.0,0.821,0.179,but lot believed him and he said will flee to my lord he is the all mighty the all wise
Al-Ankabut,40,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we gave him isaac and jacob and we appointed the prophecy and the book to be among his seed we gave him his wage in this world and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous
Al-Ankabut,24,0.7351,0.0,0.735,0.265,and lot when he said to his people surely you commit such indecency a never any being in all the world committed before you
Al-Ankabut,37,0.7615,0.037,0.768,0.194,what do you approach men and cut the way and commit in your assembly dishonour but the only answer of his people wa that they said then bring u the chastisement of god if thou speakest truly
Al-Ankabut,12,0.4019,0.0,0.803,0.197,he said my lord help me against the people that work corruption
Al-Ankabut,26,-0.6908,0.227,0.687,0.087,and when our messenger came to abraham with the good tidings they said we shall destroy the people of this city for it people are evildoer

Al-Jinn,23,0.7876,0.0,0.716,0.284,but there were certain men of mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinni and they increased them in vileness
Al-Jinn,15,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,and they thought even a you also thought that god would never raise up anyone
Al-Jinn,15,-0.4588,0.215,0.674,0.111,and we stretched towards heaven but we found it filled with terrible guard and meteor
