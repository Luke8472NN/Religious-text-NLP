Al-Baqarah,58,0.3612,0.107,0.736,0.157,and recall when moses said to his people my people indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf for worship so repent to your creator and kill yourselves that is best for all of you in the sight of your creator then he accepted your repentance indeed he is the accepting of repentance the merciful
Al-Baqarah,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recall when you said moses we will never believe you until we see allah outright so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on
Al-Baqarah,13,-0.2263,0.218,0.615,0.168,then we revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful
Al-Baqarah,37,0.0,0.051,0.897,0.051,and we shaded you with cloud and sent down to you manna and quail saying eat from the good thing with which we have provided you and they wronged u not but they were only wronging themselves

Al-Baqarah,35,-0.9186,0.273,0.727,0.0,but those who wronged changed those word to statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon those who wronged punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying
Al-Baqarah,52,0.1819,0.065,0.875,0.06,and recall when moses prayed for water for his people so we said strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve spring and every people knew it watering place eat and drink from the provision of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
Al-Baqarah,109,-0.9231,0.126,0.851,0.024,and recall when you said moses we can never endure one kind of food so call upon your lord to bring forth for u from the earth it green herb and it cucumber and it garlic and it lentil and it onion moses said would you exchange what is better for what is le go into any settlement and indeed you will have what you have asked and they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from allah upon them that wa because they repeatedly disbelieved in the sign of allah and killed the prophet without right that wa because they disobeyed and were habitually transgressing
Al-Baqarah,49,0.124,0.096,0.8,0.105,indeed those who believed and those who were jew or christian or sabeans before prophet muhammad those among them who believed in allah and the last day and did righteousness will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve

Al-Baqarah,34,-0.6249,0.141,0.859,0.0,and recall when moses said to his people indeed allah command you to slaughter cow they said do you take u in ridicule he said seek refuge in allah from being among the ignorant
Al-Baqarah,37,0.2023,0.0,0.951,0.049,they said call upon your lord to make clear to u what it is moses said allah say it is cow which is neither old nor virgin but median between that so do what you are commanded

Al-Baqarah,30,0.3818,0.0,0.912,0.088,they said call upon your lord to make clear to u what it is indeed all cow look alike to u and indeed we if allah will will be guided
Al-Baqarah,46,0.09,0.07,0.853,0.077,he said he say it is cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field one free from fault with no spot upon her they said now you have come with the truth so they slaughtered her but they could hardly do it
Al-Baqarah,21,-0.1779,0.078,0.922,0.0,and recall when you slew man and disputed over it but allah wa to bring out that which you were concealing
Al-Baqarah,29,-0.7239,0.183,0.817,0.0,so we said strike the slain man with part of it thus doe allah bring the dead to life and he show you his sign that you might reason
Al-Baqarah,58,-0.0279,0.051,0.883,0.066,then your heart became hardened after that being like stone or even harder for indeed there are stone from which river burst forth and there are some of them that split open and water come out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
Al-Baqarah,37,0.5106,0.055,0.811,0.134,do you covet the hope believer that they would believe for you while party of them used to hear the word of allah and then distort the torah after they had understood it while they were knowing
Al-Baqarah,50,-0.4396,0.107,0.838,0.055,and when they meet those who believe they say we have believed but when they are alone with one another they say do you talk to them about what allah ha revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your lord then will you not reason
Al-Baqarah,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but do they not know that allah know what they conceal and what they declare
Al-Baqarah,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and among them are unlettered one who do not know the scripture except in wishful thinking but they are only assuming
Al-Baqarah,43,-0.4365,0.173,0.708,0.119,so woe to those who write the scripture with their own hand then say this is from allah in order to exchange it for small price woe to them for what their hand have written and woe to them for what they earn
Al-Baqarah,39,0.2584,0.0,0.948,0.052,and they say never will the fire touch u except for few day say have you taken covenant with allah for allah will never break his covenant or do you say about allah that which you do not know
Al-Baqarah,22,-0.743,0.32,0.523,0.157,yes whoever earns evil and his sin ha encompassed him those are the companion of the fire they will abide therein eternally
Al-Baqarah,19,0.7783,0.0,0.756,0.244,but they who believe and do righteous deed those are the companion of paradise they will abide therein eternally
Al-Baqarah,56,-0.0485,0.11,0.8,0.091,and recall when we took the covenant from the child of israel enjoining upon them do not worship except allah and to parent do good and to relative orphan and the needy and speak to people good word and establish prayer and give zakah then you turned away except few of you and you were refusing
Al-Baqarah,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recall when we took your covenant saying do not shed each other blood or evict one another from your home then you acknowledged this while you were witnessing
Al-Baqarah,100,-0.9713,0.227,0.737,0.036,then you are those same one who are killing one another and evicting party of your people from their home cooperating against them in sin and aggression and if they come to you a captive you ransom them although their eviction wa forbidden to you so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment and allah is not unaware of what you do
Al-Baqarah,31,-0.539,0.104,0.896,0.0,those are the one who have bought the life of this world in exchange for the hereafter so the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be aided
Al-Baqarah,67,-0.8265,0.197,0.649,0.155,and we did certainly give moses the torah and followed up after him with messenger and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proof and supported him with the pure spirit but is it not that every time messenger came to you child of israel with what your soul did not desire you were arrogant and party of messenger you denied and another party you killed
Al-Baqarah,24,0.4767,0.0,0.881,0.119,and they said our heart are wrapped but in fact allah ha cursed them for their disbelief so little is it that they believe
Al-Baqarah,52,-0.6723,0.091,0.88,0.029,and when there came to them book from allah confirming that which wa with them although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved but then when there came to them that which they recognized they disbelieved in it so the curse of allah will be upon the disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,51,-0.7003,0.179,0.738,0.084,how wretched is that for which they sold themselves that they would disbelieve in what allah ha revealed through their outrage that allah would send down his favor upon whom he will from among his servant so they returned having earned wrath upon wrath and for the disbeliever is humiliating punishment
Al-Baqarah,59,-0.4939,0.105,0.823,0.072,and when it is said to them believe in what allah ha revealed they say we believe only in what wa revealed to u and they disbelieve in what came after it while it is the truth confirming that which is with them say then why did you kill the prophet of allah before if you are indeed believer
Al-Baqarah,21,0.7351,0.0,0.714,0.286,and moses had certainly brought you clear proof then you took the calf in worship after that while you were wrongdoer
Al-Baqarah,60,0.7717,0.0,0.881,0.119,and recall when we took your covenant and raised over you the mount saying take what we have given you with determination and listen they said instead we hear and disobey and their heart absorbed the worship of the calf because of their disbelief say how wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you if you should be believer
Al-Baqarah,28,-0.0516,0.166,0.674,0.16,say muhammad if the home of the hereafter with allah is for you alone and not the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
Al-Baqarah,23,0.3427,0.102,0.745,0.153,but they will never wish for it ever because of what their hand have put forth and allah is knowing of the wrongdoer
Al-Baqarah,61,-0.0763,0.088,0.798,0.113,and you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life even more than those who associate others with allah one of them wish that he could be granted life thousand year but it would not remove him in the least from the coming punishment that he should be granted life and allah is seeing of what they do
Al-Baqarah,42,0.6908,0.048,0.805,0.147,say whoever is an enemy to gabriel it is none but he who ha brought the qur an down upon your heart muhammad by permission of allah confirming that which wa before it and a guidance and good tidings for the believer
Al-Baqarah,25,-0.7906,0.233,0.767,0.0,whoever is an enemy to allah and his angel and his messenger and gabriel and michael then indeed allah is an enemy to the disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,22,0.1027,0.167,0.652,0.181,and we have certainly revealed to you verse which are clear proof and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient
Al-Baqarah,25,0.0475,0.063,0.867,0.07,is it not true that every time they took covenant party of them threw it away but in fact most of them do not believe
Al-Baqarah,40,0.4019,0.0,0.934,0.066,and when messenger from allah came to them confirming that which wa with them party of those who had been given the scripture threw the scripture of allah behind their back a if they did not know what it contained
Al-Baqarah,137,0.4867,0.076,0.821,0.103,and they followed instead what the devil had recited during the reign of solomon it wa not solomon who disbelieved but the devil disbelieved teaching people magic and that which wa revealed to the two angel at babylon harut and marut but the two angel do not teach anyone unless they say we are trial so do not disbelieve by practicing magic and yet they learn from them that by which they cause separation between man and his wife but they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of allah and the people learn what harm them and doe not benefit them but the child of israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the hereafter any share and wretched is that for which they sold themselves if they only knew
Al-Baqarah,22,0.5267,0.111,0.66,0.229,and if they had believed and feared allah then the reward from allah would have been far better if they only knew
Al-Baqarah,23,-0.8462,0.28,0.72,0.0,you who have believed say not to allah messenger ra ina but say unthurna and listen and for the disbeliever is painful punishment
Al-Baqarah,43,0.8925,0.031,0.732,0.237,neither those who disbelieve from the people of the scripture nor the polytheist wish that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but allah selects for his mercy whom he will and allah is the possessor of great bounty
Al-Baqarah,35,0.5106,0.049,0.818,0.133,we do not abrogate verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth one better than it or similar to it do you not know that allah is over all thing competent
Al-Baqarah,28,0.6908,0.0,0.82,0.18,do you not know that to allah belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth and that you have not besides allah any protector or any helper
Al-Baqarah,28,0.765,0.0,0.759,0.241,or do you intend to ask your messenger a moses wa asked before and whoever exchange faith for disbelief ha certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
Al-Baqarah,49,0.904,0.035,0.707,0.257,many of the people of the scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed out of envy from themselves even after the truth ha become clear to them so pardon and overlook until allah delivers his command indeed allah is over all thing competent
Al-Baqarah,28,0.4404,0.0,0.903,0.097,and establish prayer and give zakah and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allah indeed allah of what you do is seeing
Al-Baqarah,29,-0.0946,0.101,0.809,0.09,and they say none will enter paradise except one who is jew or christian that is merely their wishful thinking say produce your proof if you should be truthful
Al-Baqarah,36,0.7256,0.115,0.64,0.245,yes on the contrary whoever submits his face in islam to allah while being doer of good will have his reward with his lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
Al-Baqarah,56,-0.1695,0.03,0.97,0.0,the jew say the christian have nothing true to stand on and the christian say the jew have nothing to stand on although they both recite the scripture thus the polytheist speak the same a their word but allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
Al-Baqarah,51,-0.9134,0.256,0.666,0.079,and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allah from being mentioned in his mosque and strive toward their destruction it is not for them to enter them except in fear for them in this world is disgrace and they will have in the hereafter great punishment
Al-Baqarah,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and to allah belongs the east and the west so wherever you might turn there is the face of allah indeed allah is all encompassing and knowing
Al-Baqarah,27,0.6908,0.0,0.814,0.186,they say allah ha taken son exalted is he rather to him belongs whatever is in the heaven and the earth all are devoutly obedient to him

Al-Baqarah,27,0.6369,0.0,0.822,0.178,indeed we have sent you muhammad with the truth a bringer of good tidings and warner and you will not be asked about the companion of hellfire
Al-Baqarah,50,0.6486,0.039,0.826,0.135,and never will the jew or the christian approve of you until you follow their religion say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance if you were to follow their desire after what ha come to you of knowledge you would have against allah no protector or helper
Al-Baqarah,34,-0.1531,0.089,0.838,0.073,those to whom we have given the book recite it with it true recital they are the one who believe in it and whoever disbelief in it it is they who are the loser

Al-Anam,49,0.0772,0.081,0.85,0.068,and if their evasion is difficult for you then if you are able to seek tunnel into the earth or stairway into the sky to bring them sign then do so but if allah had willed he would have united them upon guidance so never be of the ignorant

Al-Anam,28,-0.8271,0.276,0.659,0.065,but those who deny our verse are deaf and dumb within darkness whomever allah will he leaf astray and whomever he will he put him on straight path
Al-Anam,33,-0.0516,0.086,0.833,0.081,say have you considered if there came to you the punishment of allah or there came to you the hour is it other than allah you would invoke if you should be truthful
Al-Anam,30,-0.6249,0.184,0.816,0.0,no it is him alone you would invoke and he would remove that for which you invoked him if he willed and you would forget what you associate with him
Al-Anam,27,-0.6808,0.189,0.811,0.0,and we have already sent messenger to nation before you muhammad then we seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves to u
Al-Anam,29,0.4118,0.064,0.819,0.117,then why when our punishment came to them did they not humble themselves but their heart became hardened and satan made attractive to them that which they were doing
Al-Anam,41,0.5574,0.05,0.823,0.128,so when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we opened to them the door of every good thing until when they rejoiced in that which they were given we seized them suddenly and they were then in despair
Al-Anam,16,0.3818,0.142,0.596,0.261,so the people that committed wrong were eliminated and praise to allah lord of the world
Al-Anam,42,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,say have you considered if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and set seal upon your heart which deity other than allah could bring them back to you look how we diversify the verse then they still turn away
Al-Anam,24,-0.4939,0.16,0.84,0.0,say have you considered if the punishment of allah should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people
Al-Anam,30,-0.0813,0.152,0.705,0.143,and we send not the messenger except a bringers of good tidings and warner so whoever belief and reform there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
Al-Anam,15,-0.8674,0.448,0.552,0.0,but those who deny our verse the punishment will touch them for their defiant disobedience
Al-Anam,49,-0.4019,0.053,0.947,0.0,say muhammad do not tell you that have the depository containing the provision of allah or that know the unseen nor do tell you that am an angel only follow what is revealed to me say is the blind equivalent to the seeing then will you not give thought
Al-Anam,33,-0.7906,0.237,0.763,0.0,and warn by the qur an those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord for them besides him will be no protector and no intercessor that they might become righteous
Al-Anam,48,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and do not send away those who call upon their lord morning and afternoon seeking his countenance not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account so were you to send them away you would then be of the wrongdoer
Al-Anam,34,0.802,0.0,0.785,0.215,and thus we have tried some of them through others that the disbeliever might say is it these whom allah ha favored among u is not allah most knowing of those who are grateful
Al-Anam,47,0.6908,0.097,0.708,0.195,and when those come to you who believe in our verse say peace be upon you your lord ha decreed upon himself mercy that any of you who doe wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself indeed he is forgiving and merciful
Al-Anam,17,-0.5267,0.175,0.825,0.0,and thus do we detail the verse and thus the way of the criminal will become evident
Al-Anam,32,-0.4325,0.14,0.8,0.061,say indeed have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allah say will not follow your desire for would then have gone astray and would not be of the rightly guided
Al-Anam,40,0.6124,0.104,0.711,0.185,say indeed am on clear evidence from my lord and you have denied it do not have that for which you are impatient the decision is only for allah he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
Al-Anam,27,-0.1406,0.058,0.904,0.038,say if had that for which you are impatient the matter would have been decided between me and you but allah is most knowing of the wrongdoer
Al-Anam,59,-0.5719,0.122,0.827,0.051,and with him are the key of the unseen none know them except him and he know what is on the land and in the sea not leaf fall but that he know it and no grain is there within the darkness of the earth and no moist or dry thing but that it is written in clear record
Al-Anam,47,0.7579,0.0,0.854,0.146,and it is he who take your soul by night and know what you have committed by day then he revives you therein that specified term may be fulfilled then to him will be your return then he will inform you about what you used to do
Al-Anam,35,-0.2617,0.098,0.83,0.072,and he is the subjugator over his servant and he sends over you guardian angel until when death come to one of you our messenger take him and they do not fail in their duty
Al-Anam,23,0.4215,0.0,0.887,0.113,then they his servant are returned to allah their true lord unquestionably his is the judgement and he is the swiftest of accountant
Al-Anam,36,0.7906,0.127,0.602,0.272,say who rescue you from the darkness of the land and sea when you call upon him imploring aloud and privately if he should save u from this crisis we will surely be among the thankful
Al-Anam,20,-0.0516,0.138,0.732,0.13,say it is allah who save you from it and from every distress then you still associate others with him
Al-Anam,46,-0.7184,0.12,0.88,0.0,say he is the one able to send upon you affliction from above you or from beneath your foot or to confuse you so you become sect and make you taste the violence of one another look how we diversify the sign that they might understand
Al-Anam,17,-0.2263,0.177,0.688,0.135,but your people have denied it while it is the truth say am not over you manager
Al-Anam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for every happening is finality and you are going to know
Al-Anam,43,-0.3612,0.104,0.846,0.051,and when you see those who engage in offensive discourse concerning our verse then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation and if satan should cause you to forget then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people
Al-Anam,24,-0.7506,0.225,0.775,0.0,and those who fear allah are not held accountable for the disbeliever at all but only for reminder that perhaps they will fear him
Al-Anam,90,-0.9783,0.252,0.717,0.031,and leave those who take their religion a amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life ha deluded but remind with the qur an lest soul be given up to destruction for what it earned it will have other than allah no protector and no intercessor and if it should offer every compensation it would not be taken from it those are the one who are given to destruction for what they have earned for them will be drink of scalding water and painful punishment because they used to disbelieve
Al-Anam,78,-0.4495,0.133,0.757,0.11,say shall we invoke instead of allah that which neither benefit u nor harm u and be turned back on our heel after allah ha guided u we would then be like one whom the devil enticed to wander upon the earth confused while he ha companion inviting him to guidance calling come to u say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the lord of the world

Al-Anam,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot and all of them we preferred over the world
Al-Anam,22,0.2263,0.0,0.917,0.083,and some among their father and their descendant and their brother and we chose them and we guided them to straight path
Al-Anam,34,-0.5927,0.104,0.896,0.0,that is the guidance of allah by which he guide whomever he will of his servant but if they had associated others with allah then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing
Al-Anam,32,-0.1901,0.087,0.818,0.094,those are the one to whom we gave the scripture and authority and prophethood but if the disbeliever deny it then we have entrusted it to people who are not therein disbeliever
Al-Anam,32,0.0258,0.048,0.901,0.051,those are the one whom allah ha guided so from their guidance take an example say ask of you for this message no payment it is not but reminder for the world
Al-Anam,75,0.5267,0.038,0.893,0.069,and they did not appraise allah with true appraisal when they said allah did not reveal to human being anything say who revealed the scripture that moses brought a light and guidance to the people you jew make it into page disclosing some of it and concealing much and you were taught that which you knew not neither you nor your father say allah revealed it then leave them in their empty discourse amusing themselves
Al-Anam,43,0.5423,0.03,0.886,0.084,and this is book which we have sent down blessed and confirming what wa before it that you may warn the mother of city and those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are maintaining their prayer
Al-Anam,95,-0.6245,0.171,0.651,0.178,and who is more unjust than one who invents lie about allah or say it ha been inspired to me while nothing ha been inspired to him and one who say will reveal something like what allah revealed and if you could but see when the wrongdoer are in the overwhelming pang of death while the angel extend their hand saying discharge your soul today you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation for what you used to say against allah other than the truth and that you were toward his verse being arrogant
Al-Anam,69,-0.0,0.091,0.818,0.091,it will be said to them and you have certainly come to u alone a we created you the first time and you have left whatever we bestowed upon you behind you and we do not see with you your intercessor which you claimed that they were among you associate of allah it ha all been severed between you and lost from you is what you used to claim
Al-Anam,34,-0.8625,0.212,0.788,0.0,indeed allah is the cleaver of grain and date seed he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living that is allah so how are you deluded
Al-Anam,31,0.6249,0.0,0.85,0.15,he is the cleaver of daybreak and ha made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
Al-Anam,34,-0.25,0.057,0.943,0.0,and it is he who placed for you the star that you may be guided by them through the darkness of the land and sea we have detailed the sign for people who know
Al-Anam,28,0.0258,0.0,0.961,0.039,and it is he who produced you from one soul and gave you place of dwelling and of storage we have detailed the sign for people who understand
Al-Anam,81,0.128,0.025,0.944,0.031,and it is he who sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby the growth of all thing we produce from it greenery from which we produce grain arranged in layer and from the palm tree of it emerging fruit are cluster hanging low and we produce garden of grapevine and olive and pomegranate similar yet varied look at each of it fruit when it yield and at it ripening indeed in that are sign for people who believe
Al-Anam,31,0.6808,0.0,0.838,0.162,but they have attributed to allah partner the jinni while he ha created them and have fabricated for him son and daughter exalted is he and high above what they describe
Al-Anam,32,0.6486,0.0,0.85,0.15,he is originator of the heaven and the earth how could he have son when he doe not have companion and he created all thing and he is of all thing knowing
Al-Anam,26,0.1695,0.076,0.826,0.099,that is allah your lord there is no deity except him the creator of all thing so worship him and he is disposer of all thing
Al-Anam,16,0.4588,0.0,0.778,0.222,vision perceives him not but he perceives all vision and he is the subtle the acquainted
Al-Anam,36,-0.1372,0.141,0.73,0.129,there ha come to you enlightenment from your lord so whoever will see doe so for the benefit of his soul and whoever is blind doe harm against it and say am not guardian over you
Al-Anam,28,0.3818,0.0,0.912,0.088,and thus do we diversify the verse so the disbeliever will say you have studied and so we may make the qur an clear for people who know
Al-Anam,27,0.0516,0.074,0.845,0.081,follow muhammad what ha been revealed to you from your lord there is no deity except him and turn away from those who associate others with allah
Al-Anam,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but if allah had willed they would not have associated and we have not appointed you over them a guardian nor are you manager over them
Al-Anam,46,0.8318,0.0,0.83,0.17,and do not insult those they invoke other than allah lest they insult allah in enmity without knowledge thus we have made pleasing to every community their deed then to their lord is their return and he will inform them about what they used to do
Al-Anam,42,0.6808,0.026,0.848,0.126,and they swear by allah their strongest oath that if sign came to them they would surely believe in it say the sign are only with allah and what will make you perceive that even if sign came they would not believe
Al-Anam,31,-0.34,0.108,0.892,0.0,and we will turn away their heart and their eye just a they refused to believe in it the first time and we will leave them in their transgression wandering blindly
Al-Anam,49,-0.5859,0.1,0.871,0.028,and even if we had sent down to them the angel with the message and the dead spoke to them of it and we gathered together every created thing in front of them they would not believe unless allah should will but most of them of that are ignorant
Al-Anam,43,-0.6091,0.144,0.816,0.04,and thus we have made for every prophet an enemy devil from mankind and jinni inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion but if your lord had willed they would not have done it so leave them and that which they invent
Al-Anam,35,0.4767,0.056,0.785,0.159,and it is so the heart of those who disbelieve in the hereafter will incline toward it and that they will be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they are committing
Al-Anam,51,0.2732,0.048,0.866,0.087,say then is it other than allah should seek a judge while it is he who ha revealed to you the book explained in detail and those to whom we previously gave the scripture know that it is sent down from your lord in truth so never be among the doubter
Al-Anam,26,0.872,0.0,0.669,0.331,and the word of your lord ha been fulfilled in truth and in justice none can alter his word and he is the hearing the knowing
Al-Anam,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you obey most of those upon the earth they will mislead you from the way of allah they follow not except assumption and they are not but falsifying
Al-Anam,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed your lord is most knowing of who stray from his way and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
Al-Anam,21,0.34,0.0,0.893,0.107,so eat of that meat upon which the name of allah ha been mentioned if you are believer in his verse
Al-Anam,60,0.5574,0.042,0.831,0.127,and why should you not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha been mentioned while he ha explained in detail to you what he ha forbidden you excepting that to which you are compelled and indeed do many lead others astray through their own inclination without knowledge indeed your lord he is most knowing of the transgressor
Al-Anam,29,-0.8225,0.292,0.649,0.059,and leave what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof indeed those who earn blame for sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit
Al-Anam,52,-0.5574,0.154,0.748,0.097,and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha not been mentioned for indeed it is grave disobedience and indeed do the devil inspire their ally among men to dispute with you and if you were to obey them indeed you would be associators of others with him
Al-Anam,47,0.25,0.111,0.742,0.147,and is one who wa dead and we gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness never to emerge therefrom thus it ha been made pleasing to the disbeliever that which they were doing
Al-Anam,28,0.1027,0.071,0.844,0.084,and thus we have placed within every city the greatest of it criminal to conspire therein but they conspire not except against themselves and they perceive it not
Al-Anam,55,-0.6908,0.146,0.782,0.072,and when sign come to them they say never will we believe until we are given like that which wa given to the messenger of allah allah is most knowing of where he place his message there will afflict those who committed crime debasement before allah and severe punishment for what they used to conspire
Al-Anam,45,0.3669,0.0,0.901,0.099,so whoever allah want to guide he expands his breast to contain islam and whoever he want to misguide he make his breast tight and constricted a though he were climbing into the sky thus doe allah place defilement upon those who do not believe
Al-Anam,19,0.2263,0.0,0.905,0.095,and this is the path of your lord leading straight we have detailed the verse for people who remember
Al-Anam,25,0.7717,0.0,0.774,0.226,for them will be the home of peace with their lord and he will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do
Al-Anam,75,0.2732,0.031,0.91,0.059,and mention muhammad the day when he will gather them together and say company of jinni you have misled many of mankind and their ally among mankind will say our lord some of u made use of others and we have now reached our term which you appointed for u he will say the fire is your residence wherein you will abide eternally except for what allah will indeed your lord is wise and knowing
Al-Anam,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thus will we make some of the wrongdoer ally of others for what they used to earn
Al-Anam,57,-0.34,0.041,0.959,0.0,company of jinni and mankind did there not come to you messenger from among you relating to you my verse and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say we bear witness against ourselves and the worldly life had deluded them and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbeliever
Al-Anam,17,0.2617,0.092,0.763,0.145,that is because your lord would not destroy the city for wrongdoing while their people were unaware
Al-Anam,20,0.1511,0.0,0.923,0.077,and for all are degree from what they have done and your lord is not unaware of what they do
Al-Anam,41,0.765,0.0,0.83,0.17,and your lord is the free of need the possessor of mercy if he will he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever he will just a he produced you from the descendant of another people
Al-Anam,15,0.6372,0.0,0.714,0.286,indeed what you are promised is coming and you will not cause failure to allah
Al-Anam,31,-0.2091,0.079,0.868,0.054,say my people work according to your position for indeed am working and you are going to know who will have succession in the home indeed the wrongdoer will not succeed
Al-Anam,59,-0.7369,0.127,0.825,0.047,and the polytheist assign to allah from that which he created of crop and livestock share and say this is for allah by their claim and this is for our partner associated with him but what is for their partner doe not reach allah while what is for allah this reach their partner evil is that which they rule
Al-Anam,54,-0.8344,0.19,0.758,0.053,and likewise to many of the polytheist their partner have made to seem pleasing the killing of their child in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion and if allah had willed they would not have done so so leave them and that which they invent
Al-Anam,62,-0.8807,0.162,0.838,0.0,and they say these animal and crop are forbidden no one may eat from them except whom we will by their claim and there are those camel whose back are forbidden by them and those upon which the name of allah is not mentioned all of this an invention of untruth about him he will punish them for what they were inventing
Al-Anam,47,-0.7579,0.203,0.684,0.113,and they say what is in the belly of these animal is exclusively for our male and forbidden to our female but if it is born dead then all of them have share therein he will punish them for their description indeed he is wise and knowing
Al-Anam,33,-0.8625,0.242,0.758,0.0,those will have lost who killed their child in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what allah had provided for them inventing untruth about allah they have gone astray and were not rightly guided
Al-Anam,63,0.0232,0.032,0.934,0.034,and he it is who cause garden to grow both trellised and untrellised and palm tree and crop of different kind of food and olive and pomegranate similar and dissimilar eat of each of it fruit when it yield and give it due zakah on the day of it harvest and be not excessive indeed he doe not like those who commit excess
Al-Anam,36,-0.34,0.147,0.737,0.115,and of the grazing livestock are carrier of burden and those too small eat of what allah ha provided for you and do not follow the footstep of satan indeed he is to you clear enemy
Al-Anam,45,0.3818,0.056,0.837,0.108,they are eight mate of the sheep two and of the goat two say is it the two male he ha forbidden or the two female or that which the womb of the two female contain inform me with knowledge if you should be truthful
Al-Anam,72,-0.6997,0.104,0.865,0.031,and of the camel two and of the cattle two say is it the two male he ha forbidden or the two female or that which the womb of the two female contain or were you witness when allah charged you with this then who is more unjust than one who invents lie about allah to mislead the people by something other than knowledge indeed allah doe not guide the wrongdoing people
Al-Anam,71,-0.4019,0.106,0.821,0.073,say do not find within that which wa revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine for indeed it is impure or it be that slaughtered in disobedience dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing it limit then indeed your lord is forgiving and merciful
Al-Anam,54,-0.1779,0.063,0.886,0.051,and to those who are jew we prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof and of the cattle and the sheep we prohibited to them their fat except what adheres to their back or the entrails or what is joined with bone by that we repaid them for their injustice and indeed we are truthful
Al-Anam,27,-0.8745,0.302,0.648,0.049,so if they deny you muhammad say your lord is the possessor of vast mercy but his punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminal
Al-Anam,61,-0.4215,0.061,0.939,0.0,those who associated with allah will say if allah had willed we would not have associated anything and neither would our father nor would we have prohibited anything likewise did those before deny until they tasted our punishment say do you have any knowledge that you can produce for u you follow not except assumption and you are not but falsifying
Al-Anam,18,-0.1779,0.123,0.788,0.089,say with allah is the far reaching argument if he had willed he would have guided you all
Al-Anam,51,-0.3089,0.085,0.872,0.044,say muhammad bring forward your witness who will testify that allah ha prohibited this and if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the desire of those who deny our verse and those who do not believe in the hereafter while they equate others with their lord
Al-Anam,82,0.7858,0.104,0.695,0.201,say come will recite what your lord ha prohibited to you he command that you not associate anything with him and to parent good treatment and do not kill your child out of poverty we will provide for you and them and do not approach immorality what is apparent of them and what is concealed and do not kill the soul which allah ha forbidden to be killed except by legal right this ha he instructed you that you may use reason
Al-Anam,64,0.9239,0.0,0.804,0.196,and do not approach the orphan property except in way that is best until he reach maturity and give full measure and weight in justice we do not charge any soul except with that within it capacity and when you testify be just even if it concern near relative and the covenant of allah fulfill this ha he instructed you that you may remember

Al-Anam,42,0.802,0.0,0.796,0.204,then we gave moses the scripture making complete our favor upon the one who did good and a detailed explanation of all thing and a guidance and mercy that perhaps in the matter of the meeting with their lord they would believe
Al-Anam,23,0.4939,0.108,0.676,0.216,and this qur an is book we have revealed which is blessed so follow it and fear allah that you may receive mercy

Al-Anam,75,-0.6142,0.152,0.73,0.118,or lest you say if only the scripture had been revealed to u we would have been better guided than they so there ha now come to you clear evidence from your lord and guidance and mercy then who is more unjust than one who denies the verse of allah and turn away from them we will recompense those who turn away from our verse with the worst of punishment for their having turned away
Al-Anam,72,0.8519,0.028,0.826,0.146,do they then wait for anything except that the angel should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the sign of your lord the day that some of the sign of your lord will come no soul will benefit from it faith a long a it had not believed before or had earned through it faith some good say wait indeed we also are waiting

Al-Anam,58,-0.5047,0.124,0.803,0.073,say is it other than allah should desire a lord while he is the lord of all thing and every soul earns not blame except against itself and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ
Al-Anam,49,0.7783,0.036,0.753,0.211,and it is he who ha made you successor upon the earth and ha raised some of you above others in degree of rank that he may try you through what he ha given you indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
Al-Araf,4,-0.4767,0.508,0.492,0.0,alif lam meem sad
Al-Araf,28,-0.5859,0.161,0.839,0.0,this is book revealed to you muhammad so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom that you may warn thereby and a reminder to the believer
Al-Araf,24,0.34,0.0,0.906,0.094,follow mankind what ha been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him any ally little do you remember
Al-Araf,22,-0.7506,0.242,0.758,0.0,and how many city have we destroyed and our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon
Al-Araf,18,-0.4939,0.158,0.842,0.0,and their declaration when our punishment came to them wa only that they said indeed we were wrongdoer
Al-Araf,18,0.7003,0.0,0.734,0.266,then we will surely question those to whom message wa sent and we will surely question the messenger
Al-Araf,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,then we will surely relate their deed to them with knowledge and we were not at all absent
Al-Araf,25,0.7269,0.0,0.79,0.21,and the weighing of deed that day will be the truth so those whose scale are heavy it is they who will be the successful
Al-Araf,23,-0.7506,0.234,0.766,0.0,and those whose scale are light they are the one who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verse
Al-Araf,21,0.7128,0.0,0.722,0.278,and we have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein way of livelihood little are you grateful
Al-Araf,34,0.5267,0.0,0.879,0.121,and we have certainly created you mankind and given you human form then we said to the angel prostrate to adam so they prostrated except for iblees he wa not of those who prostrated
Al-Araf,26,0.5574,0.076,0.669,0.255,allah said what prevented you from prostrating when commanded you satan said am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay
Al-Araf,24,0.25,0.109,0.748,0.143,allah said descend from paradise for it is not for you to be arrogant therein so get out indeed you are of the debased
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,satan said reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah said indeed you are of those reprieved
Al-Araf,20,0.2732,0.11,0.694,0.196,satan said because you have put me in error will surely sit in wait for them on your straight path
Al-Araf,31,0.5046,0.0,0.902,0.098,then will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left and you will not find most of them grateful to you
Al-Araf,22,0.128,0.208,0.568,0.224,allah said get out of paradise reproached and expelled whoever follows you among them will surely fill hell with you all together
Al-Araf,27,0.431,0.0,0.867,0.133,and adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,40,0.605,0.0,0.885,0.115,but satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which wa concealed from them of their private part he said your lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angel or become of the immortal
Al-Araf,16,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,and he swore by allah to them indeed am to you from among the sincere advisor
Al-Araf,57,0.3318,0.095,0.774,0.13,so he made them fall through deception and when they tasted of the tree their private part became apparent to them and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaf of paradise and their lord called to them did not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you clear enemy
Al-Araf,27,-0.4047,0.242,0.597,0.161,they said our lord we have wronged ourselves and if you do not forgive u and have mercy upon u we will surely be among the loser
Al-Araf,22,0.0258,0.129,0.738,0.133,allah said descend being to one another enemy and for you on the earth is place of settlement and enjoyment for time
Al-Araf,19,-0.5994,0.178,0.822,0.0,he said therein you will live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth
Al-Araf,37,0.8151,0.0,0.82,0.18,child of adam we have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private part and a adornment but the clothing of righteousness that is best that is from the sign of allah that perhaps they will remember
Al-Araf,54,-0.0516,0.074,0.856,0.07,child of adam let not satan tempt you a he removed your parent from paradise stripping them of their clothing to show them their private part indeed he see you he and his tribe from where you do not see them indeed we have made the devil ally to those who do not believe
Al-Araf,40,0.34,0.075,0.818,0.107,and when they commit an immorality they say we found our father doing it and allah ha ordered u to do it say indeed allah doe not order immorality do you say about allah that which you do not know
Al-Araf,41,0.8658,0.0,0.771,0.229,say muhammad my lord ha ordered justice and that you maintain yourselves in worship of him at every place or time of prostration and invoke him sincere to him in religion just a he originated you you will return to life
Al-Araf,30,-0.7964,0.208,0.792,0.0,group of you he guided and group deserved to be in error indeed they had taken the devil a ally instead of allah while they thought that they were guided
Al-Araf,25,0.3753,0.08,0.753,0.168,child of adam take your adornment at every masjid and eat and drink but be not excessive indeed he like not those who commit excess
Al-Araf,52,0.4767,0.034,0.841,0.125,say who ha forbidden the adornment of allah which he ha produced for his servant and the good lawful thing of provision say they are for those who believe during the worldly life but exclusively for them on the day of resurrection thus do we detail the verse for people who know
Al-Araf,49,-0.5302,0.162,0.754,0.084,say my lord ha only forbidden immorality what is apparent of them and what is concealed and sin and oppression without right and that you associate with allah that for which he ha not sent down authority and that you say about allah that which you do not know
Al-Araf,25,0.34,0.0,0.909,0.091,and for every nation is specified term so when their time ha come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
Al-Araf,34,-0.7518,0.211,0.736,0.054,child of adam if there come to you messenger from among you relating to you my verse then whoever fear allah and reform there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
Al-Araf,24,-0.8885,0.333,0.667,0.0,but the one who deny our verse and are arrogant toward them those are the companion of the fire they will abide therein eternally
Al-Araf,66,-0.8832,0.142,0.858,0.0,and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah lie or denies his verse those will attain their portion of the decree until when our messenger come to them to take them in death they will say where are those you used to invoke besides allah they will say they have departed from u and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbeliever
Al-Araf,74,-0.6956,0.101,0.899,0.0,allah will say enter among nation which had passed on before you of jinni and mankind into the fire every time nation enters it will curse it sister until when they have all overtaken one another therein the last of them will say about the first of them our lord these had misled u so give them double punishment of the fire he will say for each is double but you do not know
Al-Araf,30,-0.6929,0.175,0.825,0.0,and the first of them will say to the last of them then you had not any favor over u so taste the punishment for what you used to earn
Al-Araf,41,-0.128,0.171,0.686,0.143,indeed those who deny our verse and are arrogant toward them the gate of heaven will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until camel enters into the eye of needle and thus do we recompense the criminal
Al-Araf,19,-0.7906,0.292,0.708,0.0,they will have from hell bed and over them covering of fire and thus do we recompense the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,27,0.6124,0.083,0.744,0.173,but those who believed and did righteous deed we charge no soul except within it capacity those are the companion of paradise they will abide therein eternally
Al-Araf,76,0.8207,0.058,0.796,0.146,and we will have removed whatever is within their breast of resentment while flowing beneath them are river and they will say praise to allah who ha guided u to this and we would never have been guided if allah had not guided u certainly the messenger of our lord had come with the truth and they will be called this is paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do
Al-Araf,56,0.891,0.084,0.668,0.249,and the companion of paradise will call out to the companion of the fire we have already found what our lord promised u to be true have you found what your lord promised to be true they will say yes then an announcer will announce among them the curse of allah shall be upon the wrongdoer
Al-Araf,22,-0.0772,0.058,0.942,0.0,who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they were concerning the hereafter disbeliever
Al-Araf,41,0.5927,0.0,0.889,0.111,and between them will be partition and on it elevation are men who recognize all by their mark and they call out to the companion of paradise peace be upon you they have not yet entered it but they long intensely
Al-Araf,24,-0.34,0.098,0.902,0.0,and when their eye are turned toward the companion of the fire they say our lord do not place u with the wrongdoing people
Al-Araf,34,-0.875,0.244,0.756,0.0,and the companion of the elevation will call to men within hell whom they recognize by their mark saying of no avail to you wa your gathering and the fact that you were arrogant
Al-Araf,37,-0.6933,0.245,0.626,0.129,allah will say are these the one whom you inhabitant of hell swore that allah would never offer them mercy enter paradise people of the elevation no fear will there be concerning you nor will you grieve
Al-Araf,37,0.5859,0.115,0.686,0.199,and the companion of the fire will call to the companion of paradise pour upon u some water or from whatever allah ha provided you they will say indeed allah ha forbidden them both to the disbeliever
Al-Araf,37,-0.6486,0.189,0.751,0.061,who took their religion a distraction and amusement and whom the worldly life deluded so today we will forget them just a they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected our verse
Al-Araf,20,0.5994,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we had certainly brought them book which we detailed by knowledge a guidance and mercy to people who believe
Al-Araf,68,-0.4939,0.095,0.854,0.051,do they await except it result the day it result come those who had ignored it before will say the messenger of our lord had come with the truth so are there now any intercessor to intercede for u or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do they will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
Al-Araf,62,0.9062,0.0,0.811,0.189,indeed your lord is allah who created the heaven and earth in six day and then established himself above the throne he cover the night with the day another night chasing it rapidly and he created the sun the moon and the star subjected by his command unquestionably his is the creation and the command blessed is allah lord of the world
Al-Araf,14,-0.2755,0.14,0.86,0.0,call upon your lord in humility and privately indeed he doe not like transgressor
Al-Araf,29,0.296,0.092,0.751,0.156,and cause not corruption upon the earth after it reformation and invoke him in fear and aspiration indeed the mercy of allah is near to the doer of good
Al-Araf,54,-0.6369,0.137,0.778,0.086,and it is he who sends the wind a good tidings before his mercy until when they have carried heavy rainclouds we drive them to dead land and we send down rain therein and bring forth thereby some of all the fruit thus will we bring forth the dead perhaps you may be reminded
Al-Araf,34,-0.4404,0.179,0.685,0.136,and the good land it vegetation emerges by permission of it lord but that which is bad nothing emerges except sparsely with difficulty thus do we diversify the sign for people who are grateful
Al-Araf,31,-0.6124,0.219,0.663,0.117,we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him indeed fear for you the punishment of tremendous day
Al-Araf,13,-0.0258,0.166,0.675,0.16,said the eminent among his people indeed we see you in clear error
Al-Araf,19,0.1603,0.0,0.917,0.083,noah said my people there is not error in me but am messenger from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,convey to you the message of my lord and advise you and know from allah what you do not know
Al-Araf,35,0.0772,0.114,0.765,0.121,then do you wonder that there ha come to you reminder from your lord through man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear allah so you might receive mercy
Al-Araf,30,-0.9258,0.363,0.547,0.09,but they denied him so we saved him and those who were with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our sign indeed they were blind people
Al-Araf,28,0.3875,0.069,0.781,0.151,and to the aad we sent their brother hud he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
Al-Araf,24,-0.7269,0.217,0.783,0.0,said the eminent one who disbelieved among his people indeed we see you in foolishness and indeed we think you are of the liar
Al-Araf,19,0.1695,0.0,0.915,0.085,hud said my people there is not foolishness in me but am messenger from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,14,0.5574,0.0,0.783,0.217,convey to you the message of my lord and am to you trustworthy adviser
Al-Araf,52,0.8797,0.023,0.767,0.21,then do you wonder that there ha come to you reminder from your lord through man from among you that he may warn you and remember when he made you successor after the people of noah and increased you in stature extensively so remember the favor of allah that you might succeed
Al-Araf,34,0.8402,0.081,0.635,0.284,they said have you come to u that we should worship allah alone and leave what our father have worshipped then bring u what you promise u if you should be of the truthful
Al-Araf,48,-0.7351,0.16,0.773,0.067,hud said already have defilement and anger fallen upon you from your lord do you dispute with me concerning mere name you have named them you and your father for which allah ha not sent down any authority then wait indeed am with you among those who wait
Al-Araf,27,0.3976,0.092,0.731,0.177,so we saved him and those with him by mercy from u and we eliminated those who denied our sign and they were not at all believer
Al-Araf,65,-0.7365,0.175,0.731,0.094,and to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there ha come to you clear evidence from your lord this is the she camel of allah sent to you a sign so leave her to eat within allah land and do not touch her with harm lest there seize you painful punishment
Al-Araf,47,0.7253,0.036,0.814,0.151,and remember when he made you successor after the aad and settled you in the land and you take for yourselves palace from it plain and carve from the mountain home then remember the favor of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
Al-Araf,45,-0.743,0.128,0.872,0.0,said the eminent one who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed to those who believed among them do you actually know that salih is sent from his lord they said indeed we in that with which he wa sent are believer
Al-Araf,15,-0.4939,0.186,0.814,0.0,said those who were arrogant indeed we in that which you have believed are disbeliever
Al-Araf,31,0.3182,0.0,0.924,0.076,so they hamstrung the she camel and were insolent toward the command of their lord and said salih bring u what you promise u if you should be of the messenger
Al-Araf,14,-0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corps fallen prone
Al-Araf,29,-0.2418,0.085,0.861,0.054,and he turned away from them and said my people had certainly conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you but you do not like advisor
Al-Araf,27,0.2023,0.125,0.724,0.151,and we had sent lot when he said to his people do you commit such immorality a no one ha preceded you with from among the world
Al-Araf,14,0.4019,0.0,0.828,0.172,indeed you approach men with desire instead of woman rather you are transgressing people
Al-Araf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but the answer of his people wa only that they said evict them from your city indeed they are men who keep themselves pure
Al-Araf,20,-0.2551,0.163,0.715,0.122,so we saved him and his family except for his wife she wa of those who remained with the evildoer
Al-Araf,17,-0.5267,0.175,0.825,0.0,and we rained upon them rain of stone then see how wa the end of the criminal
Al-Araf,69,0.9216,0.027,0.769,0.203,and to the people of madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there ha come to you clear evidence from your lord so fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after it reformation that is better for you if you should be believer
Al-Araf,45,-0.3182,0.07,0.887,0.043,and do not sit on every path threatening and averting from the way of allah those who believe in him seeking to make it seem deviant and remember when you were few and he increased you and see how wa the end of the corrupters
Al-Araf,39,0.8402,0.0,0.795,0.205,and if there should be group among you who ha believed in that with which have been sent and group that ha not believed then be patient until allah judge between u and he is the best of judge
Al-Araf,41,-0.0772,0.071,0.865,0.064,said the eminent one who were arrogant among his people we will surely evict you shu ayb and those who have believed with you from our city or you must return to our religion he said even if we were unwilling
Al-Araf,70,0.8934,0.0,0.843,0.157,we would have invented against allah lie if we returned to your religion after allah had saved u from it and it is not for u to return to it except that allah our lord should will our lord ha encompassed all thing in knowledge upon allah we have relied our lord decide between u and our people in truth and you are the best of those who give decision
Al-Araf,21,-0.5267,0.145,0.855,0.0,said the eminent one who disbelieved among his people if you should follow shu ayb indeed you would then be loser
Al-Araf,14,-0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corps fallen prone
Al-Araf,26,-0.8481,0.295,0.705,0.0,those who denied shu ayb it wa a though they had never resided there those who denied shu ayb it wa they who were the loser
Al-Araf,30,-0.1189,0.086,0.842,0.072,and he turned away from them and said my people had certainly conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you so how could grieve for disbelieving people
Al-Araf,27,-0.8658,0.318,0.682,0.0,and we sent to no city prophet who wa denied except that we seized it people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves to allah
Al-Araf,36,0.1779,0.131,0.7,0.169,then we exchanged in place of the bad condition good until they increased and prospered and said our father also were touched with hardship and ease so we seized them suddenly while they did not perceive
Al-Araf,40,-0.4019,0.129,0.779,0.092,and if only the people of the city had believed and feared allah we would have opened upon them blessing from the heaven and the earth but they denied the messenger so we seized them for what they were earning
Al-Araf,21,-0.2023,0.13,0.772,0.098,then did the people of the city feel secure from our punishment coming to them at night while they were asleep
Al-Araf,23,0.1531,0.114,0.714,0.171,or did the people of the city feel secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they were at play
Al-Araf,24,-0.34,0.2,0.645,0.155,then did they feel secure from the plan of allah but no one feel secure from the plan of allah except the losing people
Al-Araf,37,-0.2942,0.098,0.859,0.043,ha it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after it previous people that if we willed we could afflict them for their sin but we seal over their heart so they do not hear
Al-Araf,45,-0.3291,0.078,0.851,0.071,those city we relate to you muhammad some of their news and certainly did their messenger come to them with clear proof but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus doe allah seal over the heart of the disbeliever
Al-Araf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we did not find for most of them any covenant but indeed we found most of them defiantly disobedient
Al-Araf,29,-0.6652,0.137,0.863,0.0,then we sent after them moses with our sign to pharaoh and his establishment but they were unjust toward them so see how wa the end of the corrupters
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and moses said pharaoh am messenger from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,29,0.5994,0.0,0.846,0.154,who is obligated not to say about allah except the truth have come to you with clear evidence from your lord so send with me the child of israel
Al-Araf,19,0.4588,0.0,0.857,0.143,pharaoh said if you have come with sign then bring it forth if you should be of the truthful
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so moses threw his staff and suddenly it wa serpent manifest
Al-Araf,15,0.6808,0.0,0.699,0.301,and he drew out his hand thereupon it wa white with radiance for the observer
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said the eminent among the people of pharaoh indeed this is learned magician
Al-Araf,15,-0.3818,0.169,0.756,0.076,who want to expel you from your land through magic so what do you instruct
Al-Araf,16,-0.2023,0.112,0.824,0.065,they said postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the city gatherer
Al-Araf,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who will bring you every learned magician
Al-Araf,18,0.5719,0.0,0.812,0.188,and the magician came to pharaoh they said indeed for u is reward if we are the predominant
Al-Araf,14,0.4019,0.0,0.828,0.172,he said yes and moreover you will be among those made near to me
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses either you throw your staff or we will be the one to throw first
Al-Araf,26,-0.0772,0.166,0.708,0.126,he said throw and when they threw they bewitched the eye of the people and struck terror into them and they presented great feat of magic
Al-Araf,17,0.4939,0.0,0.833,0.167,and we inspired to moses throw your staff and at once it devoured what they were falsifying
Al-Araf,12,0.3774,0.0,0.81,0.19,so the truth wa established and abolished wa what they were doing
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician fell down in prostration to allah
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we have believed in the lord of the world
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,31,-0.4854,0.125,0.875,0.0,said pharaoh you believed in him before gave you permission indeed this is conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom it people but you are going to know
Al-Araf,18,0.7845,0.084,0.558,0.359,will surely cut off your hand and your foot on opposite side then will surely crucify you all
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said indeed to our lord we will return
Al-Araf,37,-0.5239,0.11,0.847,0.043,and you do not resent u except because we believed in the sign of our lord when they came to u our lord pour upon u patience and let u die a muslim in submission to you
Al-Araf,47,-0.6249,0.159,0.757,0.085,and the eminent among the people of pharaoh said will you leave moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your god pharaoh said we will kill their son and keep their woman alive and indeed we are subjugator over them
Al-Araf,37,0.7845,0.0,0.835,0.165,said moses to his people seek help through allah and be patient indeed the earth belongs to allah he cause to inherit it whom he will of his servant and the best outcome is for the righteous
Al-Araf,40,-0.7783,0.213,0.696,0.091,they said we have been harmed before you came to u and after you have come to u he said perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do
Al-Araf,22,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,and we certainly seized the people of pharaoh with year of famine and deficiency in fruit that perhaps they would be reminded
Al-Araf,43,-0.8885,0.238,0.694,0.069,but when good came to them they said this is ours by right and if bad condition struck them they saw an evil omen in moses and those with him unquestionably their fortune is with allah but most of them do not know
Al-Araf,22,-0.2732,0.103,0.845,0.052,and they said no matter what sign you bring u with which to bewitch u we will not be believer in you
Al-Araf,26,-0.8934,0.327,0.673,0.0,so we sent upon them the flood and locust and louse and frog and blood a distinct sign but they were arrogant and were criminal people
Al-Araf,44,0.1027,0.125,0.723,0.152,and when the punishment descended upon them they said moses invoke for u your lord by what he ha promised you if you can remove the punishment from u we will surely believe you and we will send with you the child of israel
Al-Araf,22,-0.8338,0.284,0.675,0.041,but when we removed the punishment from them until term which they were to reach then at once they broke their word
Al-Araf,23,-0.7783,0.245,0.755,0.0,so we took retribution from them and we drowned them in the sea because they denied our sign and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,63,0.5106,0.085,0.785,0.13,and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern region of the land and the western one which we had blessed and the good word of your lord wa fulfilled for the child of israel because of what they had patiently endured and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building
Al-Araf,43,0.5574,0.056,0.791,0.154,and we took the child of israel across the sea then they came upon people intent in devotion to some idol of theirs they said moses make for u god just a they have god he said indeed you are people behaving ignorantly
Al-Araf,18,-0.4215,0.25,0.574,0.176,indeed those worshipper destroyed is that in which they are engaged and worthless is whatever they were doing
Al-Araf,21,0.7351,0.0,0.702,0.298,he said is it other than allah should desire for you a god while he ha preferred you over the world
Al-Araf,39,0.0,0.163,0.654,0.183,and recall child of israel when we saved you from the people of pharaoh who were afflicting you with the worst torment killing your son and keeping your woman alive and in that wa great trial from your lord
Al-Araf,55,0.5719,0.0,0.935,0.065,and we made an appointment with moses for thirty night and perfected them by the addition of ten so the term of his lord wa completed a forty night and moses said to his brother aaron take my place among my people do right by them and do not follow the way of the corrupters
Al-Araf,85,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when moses arrived at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show me yourself that may look at you allah said you will not see me but look at the mountain if it should remain in place then you will see me but when his lord appeared to the mountain he rendered it level and moses fell unconscious and when he awoke he said exalted are you have repented to you and am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,28,0.4588,0.0,0.9,0.1,allah said moses have chosen you over the people with my message and my word to you so take what have given you and be among the grateful
Al-Araf,42,0.7845,0.0,0.853,0.147,and we wrote for him on the tablet something of all thing instruction and explanation for all thing saying take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient
Al-Araf,71,-0.8894,0.164,0.836,0.0,will turn away from my sign those who are arrogant upon the earth without right and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it a way but if they see the way of error they will adopt it a way that is because they have denied our sign and they were heedless of them
Al-Araf,26,-0.7003,0.195,0.805,0.0,those who denied our sign and the meeting of the hereafter their deed have become worthless are they recompensed except for what they used to do
Al-Araf,43,0.1779,0.034,0.917,0.049,and the people of moses made after his departure from their ornament calf an image having lowing sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to way they took it for worship and they were wrongdoer
Al-Araf,34,-0.5122,0.206,0.67,0.124,and when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord doe not have mercy upon u and forgive u we will surely be among the loser
Al-Araf,88,-0.9409,0.182,0.779,0.038,and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said how wretched is that by which you have replaced me after my departure were you impatient over the matter of your lord and he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the hair of his head pulling him toward him aaron said son of my mother indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me so let not the enemy rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people
Al-Araf,24,0.6597,0.0,0.758,0.242,moses said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
Al-Araf,31,-0.7351,0.197,0.745,0.059,indeed those who took the calf for worship will obtain anger from their lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do we recompense the inventor of falsehood
Al-Araf,20,0.7579,0.0,0.735,0.265,but those who committed misdeed and then repented after them and believed indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful
Al-Araf,28,-0.6597,0.201,0.727,0.073,and when the anger subsided in moses he took up the tablet and in their inscription wa guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their lord
Al-Araf,85,0.9308,0.062,0.753,0.186,and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment and when the earthquake seized them he said my lord if you had willed you could have destroyed them before and me a well would you destroy u for what the foolish among u have done this is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guide whom you will you are our protector so forgive u and have mercy upon u and you are the best of forgiver
Al-Araf,58,-0.296,0.099,0.82,0.08,and decree for u in this world that which is good and also in the hereafter indeed we have turned back to you allah said my punishment afflict with it whom will but my mercy encompasses all thing so will decree it especially for those who fear me and give zakah and those who believe in our verse
Al-Araf,91,0.4939,0.115,0.741,0.144,those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and make lawful for them the good thing and prohibits for them the evil and relief them of their burden and the shackle which were upon them so they who have believed in him honored him supported him and followed the light which wa sent down with him it is those who will be the successful
Al-Araf,62,-0.4215,0.089,0.863,0.048,say muhammad mankind indeed am the messenger of allah to you all from him to whom belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth there is no deity except him he give life and cause death so believe in allah and his messenger the unlettered prophet who belief in allah and his word and follow him that you may be guided
Al-Araf,17,0.6908,0.0,0.725,0.275,and among the people of moses is community which guide by truth and by it establishes justice
Al-Araf,80,0.2144,0.039,0.911,0.05,and we divided them into twelve descendant tribe a distinct nation and we inspired to moses when his people implored him for water strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve spring every people knew it watering place and we shaded them with cloud and sent down upon them manna and quail saying eat from the good thing with which we have provided you and they wronged u not but they were only wronging themselves
Al-Araf,51,0.8591,0.099,0.626,0.275,and mention muhammad when it wa said to them dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you will and say relieve u of our burden and enter the gate bowing humbly we will then forgive you your sin we will increase the doer of good in goodness and reward
Al-Araf,36,-0.9231,0.272,0.728,0.0,but those who wronged among them changed the word to statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent upon them punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing
Al-Araf,55,-0.2732,0.039,0.941,0.02,and ask them about the town that wa by the sea when they transgressed in the matter of the sabbath when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them thus did we give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient
Al-Araf,41,-0.93,0.322,0.632,0.046,and when community among them said why do you advise or warn people whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with severe punishment they the advisor said to be absolved before your lord and perhaps they may fear him
Al-Araf,31,-0.8885,0.316,0.618,0.067,and when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged with wretched punishment because they were defiantly disobeying
Al-Araf,19,-0.6705,0.244,0.756,0.0,so when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden we said to them be ape despised
Al-Araf,43,0.3919,0.091,0.764,0.145,and mention when your lord declared that he would surely continue to send upon them until the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
Al-Araf,36,-0.1531,0.087,0.842,0.072,and we divided them throughout the earth into nation of them some were righteous and of them some were otherwise and we tested them with good time and bad that perhaps they would return to obedience
Al-Araf,85,0.6705,0.06,0.811,0.129,and there followed them successor who inherited the scripture while taking the commodity of this lower life and saying it will be forgiven for u and if an offer like it come to them they will again take it wa not the covenant of the scripture taken from them that they would not say about allah except the truth and they studied what wa in it and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear allah so will you not use reason
Al-Araf,24,0.2734,0.16,0.677,0.163,but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformer
Al-Araf,47,0.1531,0.063,0.843,0.094,and mention when we raised the mountain above them a if it wa dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them and allah said take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear allah
Al-Araf,51,0.1779,0.037,0.912,0.05,and mention when your lord took from the child of adam from their loin their descendant and made them testify of themselves saying to them am not your lord they said yes we have testified this lest you should say on the day of resurrection indeed we were of this unaware
Al-Araf,35,-0.631,0.124,0.834,0.042,or lest you say it wa only that our father associated others in worship with allah before and we were but descendant after them then would you destroy u for what the falsifier have done
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thus do we explain in detail the verse and perhaps they will return
Al-Araf,33,-0.1901,0.052,0.948,0.0,and recite to them muhammad the news of him to whom we gave knowledge of our sign but he detached himself from them so satan pursued him and he became of the deviators
Al-Araf,67,0.3919,0.069,0.841,0.091,and if we had willed we could have elevated him thereby but he adhered instead to the earth and followed his own desire so his example is like that of the dog if you chase him he pant or if you leave him he still pant that is the example of the people who denied our sign so relate the story that perhaps they will give thought
Al-Araf,18,-0.886,0.409,0.591,0.0,how evil an example is that of the people who denied our sign and used to wrong themselves
Al-Araf,20,-0.5267,0.152,0.848,0.0,whoever allah guide he is the rightly guided and whoever he sends astray it is those who are the loser
Al-Araf,57,0.0772,0.071,0.822,0.107,and we have certainly created for hell many of the jinni and mankind they have heart with which they do not understand they have eye with which they do not see and they have ear with which they do not hear those are like livestock rather they are more astray it is they who are the heedless
Al-Araf,34,0.6124,0.032,0.856,0.112,and to allah belong the best name so invoke him by them and leave the company of those who practice deviation concerning his name they will be recompensed for what they have been doing
Al-Araf,15,0.7717,0.0,0.609,0.391,and among those we created is community which guide by truth and thereby establishes justice
Al-Araf,19,-0.8462,0.324,0.676,0.0,but those who deny our sign we will progressively lead them to destruction from where they do not know
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and will give them time indeed my plan is firm
Al-Araf,20,-0.6515,0.271,0.729,0.0,then do they not give thought there is in their companion muhammad no madness he is not but clear warner
Al-Araf,37,0.8442,0.0,0.766,0.234,do they not look into the realm of the heaven and the earth and everything that allah ha created and think that perhaps their appointed time ha come near so in what statement hereafter will they believe
Al-Araf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,whoever allah sends astray there is no guide for him and he leaf them in their transgression wandering blindly
Al-Araf,68,0.2846,0.0,0.968,0.032,they ask you muhammad about the hour when is it arrival say it knowledge is only with my lord none will reveal it time except him it lay heavily upon the heaven and the earth it will not come upon you except unexpectedly they ask you a if you are familiar with it say it knowledge is only with allah but most of the people do not know
Al-Araf,46,0.3182,0.154,0.653,0.193,say hold not for myself the power of benefit or harm except what allah ha willed and if knew the unseen could have acquired much wealth and no harm would have touched me am not except warner and bringer of good tidings to people who believe
Al-Araf,60,0.8957,0.041,0.722,0.237,it is he who created you from one soul and created from it it mate that he might dwell in security with her and when he cover her she carry light burden and continues therein and when it becomes heavy they both invoke allah their lord if you should give u good child we will surely be among the grateful
Al-Araf,28,0.7876,0.0,0.789,0.211,but when he give them good child they ascribe partner to him concerning that which he ha given them exalted is allah above what they associate with him
Al-Araf,14,0.4767,0.0,0.745,0.255,do they associate with him those who create nothing and they are themselves created
Al-Araf,15,0.6597,0.0,0.707,0.293,and the false deity are unable to give them help nor can they help themselves
Al-Araf,28,0.296,0.0,0.89,0.11,and if you believer invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is all the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent
Al-Araf,27,0.6705,0.0,0.82,0.18,indeed those you polytheist call upon besides allah are servant like you so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truthful
Al-Araf,50,0.128,0.069,0.872,0.059,do they have foot by which they walk or do they have hand by which they strike or do they have eye by which they see or do they have ear by which they hear say muhammad call your partner and then conspire against me and give me no respite
Al-Araf,19,0.34,0.0,0.882,0.118,indeed my protector is allah who ha sent down the book and he is an ally to the righteous
Al-Araf,17,0.6597,0.0,0.735,0.265,and those you call upon besides him are unable to help you nor can they help themselves
Al-Araf,23,0.1531,0.0,0.932,0.068,and if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking at you while they do not see
Al-Araf,15,0.5719,0.106,0.603,0.291,take what is given freely enjoin what is good and turn away from the ignorant
Al-Araf,21,-0.6597,0.18,0.82,0.0,and if an evil suggestion come to you from satan then seek refuge in allah indeed he is hearing and knowing
Al-Araf,21,-0.4939,0.138,0.862,0.0,indeed those who fear allah when an impulse touch them from satan they remember him and at once they have insight
Al-Araf,15,-0.7482,0.372,0.424,0.204,but their brother the devil increase them in error then they do not stop short
Al-Araf,44,0.3612,0.0,0.945,0.055,and when you muhammad do not bring them sign they say why have you not contrived it say only follow what is revealed to me from my lord this qur an is enlightenment from your lord and guidance and mercy for people who believe
Al-Araf,19,0.2732,0.067,0.813,0.12,so when the qur an is recited then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy
Al-Araf,29,-0.4939,0.103,0.897,0.0,and remember your lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech in the morning and the evening and do not be among the heedless
Al-Araf,24,0.5996,0.04,0.776,0.184,indeed those who are near your lord are not prevented by arrogance from his worship and they exalt him and to him they prostrate
Al-Anfal,41,-0.8408,0.17,0.83,0.0,they ask you muhammad about the bounty of war say the decision concerning bounty is for allah and the messenger so fear allah and amend that which is between you and obey allah and his messenger if you should be believer
Al-Anfal,33,0.2263,0.084,0.783,0.133,the believer are only those who when allah is mentioned their heart become fearful and when his verse are recited to them it increase them in faith and upon their lord they rely
Al-Anfal,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the one who establish prayer and from what we have provided them they spend
Al-Anfal,20,0.7906,0.0,0.68,0.32,those are the believer truly for them are degree of high position with their lord and forgiveness and noble provision
Al-Anfal,28,0.34,0.082,0.759,0.158,it is just a when your lord brought you out of your home for the battle of badr in truth while indeed party among the believer were unwilling
Al-Anfal,24,-0.4588,0.224,0.617,0.159,arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear a if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on
Al-Anfal,41,0.5719,0.0,0.892,0.108,remember believer when allah promised you one of the two group that it would be yours and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours but allah intended to establish the truth by his word and to eliminate the disbeliever
Al-Anfal,15,-0.5859,0.299,0.588,0.113,that he should establish the truth and abolish falsehood even if the criminal disliked it
Al-Anfal,24,0.4019,0.0,0.895,0.105,remember when you asked help of your lord and he answered you indeed will reinforce you with thousand from the angel following one another
Al-Anfal,32,0.6475,0.079,0.734,0.187,and allah made it not but good tidings and so that your heart would be assured thereby and victory is not but from allah indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
Al-Anfal,46,0.1531,0.082,0.768,0.15,remember when he overwhelmed you with drowsiness giving security from him and sent down upon you from the sky rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil suggestion of satan and to make steadfast your heart and plant firmly thereby your foot
Al-Anfal,39,-0.0493,0.155,0.715,0.13,remember when your lord inspired to the angel am with you so strengthen those who have believed will cast terror into the heart of those who disbelieved so strike them upon the neck and strike from them every fingertip
Al-Anfal,22,-0.6808,0.219,0.781,0.0,that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah and his messenger indeed allah is severe in penalty
Al-Anfal,17,-0.6808,0.272,0.728,0.0,that is yours so taste it and indeed for the disbeliever is the punishment of the fire
Al-Anfal,22,-0.5859,0.194,0.806,0.0,you who have believed when you meet those who disbelieve advancing for battle do not turn to them your back in flight
Al-Anfal,39,-0.8555,0.244,0.66,0.096,and whoever turn his back to them on such day unless swerving a strategy for war or joining another company ha certainly returned with anger upon him from allah and his refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
Al-Anfal,42,-0.2572,0.121,0.758,0.121,and you did not kill them but it wa allah who killed them and you threw not muhammad when you threw but it wa allah who threw that he might test the believer with good test indeed allah is hearing and knowing
Al-Anfal,14,-0.4215,0.177,0.823,0.0,that is so and also that allah will weaken the plot of the disbeliever
Al-Anfal,58,-0.5187,0.139,0.755,0.105,if you disbeliever seek the victory the defeat ha come to you and if you desist from hostility it is best for you but if you return to war we will return and never will you be availed by your large company at all even if it should increase and that is because allah is with the believer
Al-Anfal,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you who have believed obey allah and his messenger and do not turn from him while you hear his order
Al-Anfal,16,-0.2755,0.123,0.877,0.0,and do not be like those who say we have heard while they do not hear
Al-Anfal,21,-0.8126,0.28,0.72,0.0,indeed the worst of living creature in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason
Al-Anfal,30,0.0516,0.08,0.833,0.086,had allah known any good in them he would have made them hear and if he had made them hear they would still have turned away while they were refusing
Al-Anfal,39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you who have believed respond to allah and to the messenger when he call you to that which give you life and know that allah intervenes between man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered
Al-Anfal,22,-0.8842,0.389,0.565,0.046,and fear trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively and know that allah is severe in penalty
Al-Anfal,37,0.8126,0.093,0.678,0.229,and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land fearing that people might abduct you but he sheltered you supported you with his victory and provided you with good thing that you might be grateful
Al-Anfal,20,0.876,0.0,0.629,0.371,you who have believed do not betray allah and the messenger or betray your trust while you know the consequence
Al-Anfal,19,0.9413,0.0,0.537,0.463,and know that your property and your child are but trial and that allah ha with him great reward
Al-Anfal,31,0.6705,0.082,0.694,0.224,you who have believed if you fear allah he will grant you criterion and will remove from you your misdeed and forgive you and allah is the possessor of great bounty
Al-Anfal,34,0.6059,0.07,0.787,0.143,and remember muhammad when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you from makkah but they plan and allah plan and allah is the best of planner
Al-Anfal,31,0.1901,0.0,0.945,0.055,and when our verse are recited to them they say we have heard if we willed we could say something like this this is not but legend of the former people
Al-Anfal,28,-0.5859,0.194,0.732,0.073,and remember when they said allah if this should be the truth from you then rain down upon u stone from the sky or bring u painful punishment
Al-Anfal,22,0.8744,0.0,0.656,0.344,but allah would not punish them while you muhammad are among them and allah would not punish them while they seek forgiveness
Al-Anfal,40,0.6907,0.057,0.787,0.157,but why should allah not punish them while they obstruct people from al masjid al haram and they were not fit to be it guardian it true guardian are not but the righteous but most of them do not know
Al-Anfal,20,-0.5367,0.154,0.846,0.0,and their prayer at the house wa not except whistling and handclapping so taste the punishment for what you disbelieved
Al-Anfal,45,-0.7964,0.207,0.734,0.059,indeed those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert people from the way of allah so they will spend it then it will be for them source of regret then they will be overcome and those who have disbelieved unto hell they will be gathered
Al-Anfal,38,-0.9169,0.292,0.651,0.057,this is so that allah may distinguish the wicked from the good and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap them all together and put them into hell it is those who are the loser
Al-Anfal,37,-0.4497,0.164,0.693,0.143,say to those who have disbelieved that if they cease what ha previously occurred will be forgiven for them but if they return to hostility then the precedent of the former rebellious people ha already taken place
Al-Anfal,31,-0.5859,0.142,0.858,0.0,and fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion all of it is for allah and if they cease then indeed allah is seeing of what they do
Al-Anfal,21,0.9349,0.0,0.577,0.423,but if they turn away then know that allah is your protector excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper
Al-Anfal,71,-0.6124,0.082,0.888,0.03,and know that anything you obtain of war booty then indeed for allah is one fifth of it and for the messenger and for his near relative and the orphan the needy and the stranded traveler if you have believed in allah and in that which we sent down to our servant on the day of criterion the day when the two army met and allah over all thing is competent
Al-Anfal,79,0.7469,0.037,0.863,0.1,remember when you were on the near side of the valley and they were on the farther side and the caravan wa lower in position than you if you had made an appointment to meet you would have missed the appointment but it wa so that allah might accomplish matter already destined that those who perished through disbelief would perish upon evidence and those who lived in faith would live upon evidence and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
Al-Anfal,55,0.4939,0.087,0.773,0.14,remember muhammad when allah showed them to you in your dream a few and if he had shown them to you a many you believer would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter of whether to fight but allah saved you from that indeed he is knowing of that within the breast
Al-Anfal,41,0.4588,0.0,0.878,0.122,and remember when he showed them to you when you met a few in your eye and he made you appear a few in their eye so that allah might accomplish matter already destined and to allah are all matter returned
Al-Anfal,23,0.0772,0.124,0.742,0.134,you who have believed when you encounter company from the enemy force stand firm and remember allah much that you may be successful
Al-Anfal,29,0.7147,0.074,0.688,0.238,and obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute and thus lose courage and then your strength would depart and be patient indeed allah is with the patient
Al-Anfal,35,-0.4234,0.104,0.896,0.0,and do not be like those who came forth from their home insolently and to be seen by people and avert them from the way of allah and allah is encompassing of what they do
Al-Anfal,63,-0.52,0.124,0.798,0.078,and remember when satan made their deed pleasing to them and said no one can overcome you today from among the people and indeed am your protector but when the two army sighted each other he turned on his heel and said indeed am disassociated from you indeed see what you do not see indeed fear allah and allah is severe in penalty
Al-Anfal,32,0.705,0.0,0.837,0.163,remember when the hypocrite and those in whose heart wa disease said their religion ha deluded those muslim but whoever relies upon allah then indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
Al-Anfal,33,-0.8126,0.193,0.807,0.0,and if you could but see when the angel take the soul of those who disbelieved they are striking their face and their back and saying taste the punishment of the burning fire
Al-Anfal,21,0.1285,0.155,0.636,0.209,that is for what your hand have put forth of evil and because allah is not ever unjust to his servant
Al-Anfal,37,-0.5994,0.198,0.688,0.114,theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they disbelieved in the sign of allah so allah seized them for their sin indeed allah is powerful and severe in penalty
Al-Anfal,28,-0.3089,0.077,0.923,0.0,that is because allah would not change favor which he had bestowed upon people until they change what is within themselves and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
Al-Anfal,42,-0.9077,0.26,0.693,0.047,theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they denied the sign of their lord so we destroyed them for their sin and we drowned the people of pharaoh and all of them were wrongdoer
Al-Anfal,22,-0.6249,0.163,0.837,0.0,indeed the worst of living creature in the sight of allah are those who have disbelieved and they will not ever believe
Al-Anfal,21,0.5334,0.0,0.853,0.147,the one with whom you made treaty but then they break their pledge every time and they do not fear allah
Al-Anfal,24,0.0772,0.13,0.698,0.173,so if you muhammad gain dominance over them in war disperse by mean of them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded
Al-Anfal,26,-0.8446,0.284,0.716,0.0,if you have reason to fear from people betrayal throw their treaty back to them putting you on equal term indeed allah doe not like traitor
Al-Anfal,18,0.6474,0.0,0.705,0.295,and let not those who disbelieve think they will escape indeed they will not cause failure to allah
Al-Anfal,61,-0.6112,0.133,0.821,0.046,and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steed of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom allah know and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged
Al-Anfal,25,0.5423,0.0,0.873,0.127,and if they incline to peace then incline to it also and rely upon allah indeed it is he who is the hearing the knowing

Yunus,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and moses said my people if you have believed in allah then rely upon him if you should be muslim
Yunus,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they said upon allah do we rely our lord make u not object of trial for the wrongdoing people
Yunus,10,0.6908,0.0,0.551,0.449,and save u by your mercy from the disbelieving people
Yunus,32,0.7269,0.0,0.831,0.169,and we inspired to moses and his brother settle your people in egypt in house and make your house facing the qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believer
Yunus,52,0.1027,0.151,0.693,0.157,and moses said our lord indeed you have given pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life our lord that they may lead men astray from your way our lord obliterate their wealth and harden their heart so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment
Yunus,23,0.34,0.0,0.902,0.098,allah said your supplication ha been answered so remain on right course and follow not the way of those who do not know
Yunus,48,-0.296,0.045,0.955,0.0,and we took the child of israel across the sea and pharaoh and his soldier pursued them in tyranny and enmity until when drowning overtook him he said believe that there is no deity except that in whom the child of israel believe and am of the muslim
Yunus,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,now and you had disobeyed him before and were of the corrupters
Yunus,29,0.7506,0.0,0.808,0.192,so today we will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you sign and indeed many among the people of our sign are heedless
Yunus,51,0.7717,0.0,0.862,0.138,and we had certainty settled the child of israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good thing and they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
Yunus,42,0.25,0.104,0.752,0.144,so if you are in doubt muhammad about that which we have revealed to you then ask those who have been reading the scripture before you the truth ha certainly come to you from your lord so never be among the doubter
Yunus,17,-0.7003,0.279,0.721,0.0,and never be of those who deny the sign of allah and thus be among the loser
Yunus,16,0.34,0.0,0.862,0.138,indeed those upon whom the word of your lord ha come into effect will not believe
Yunus,14,-0.7269,0.337,0.663,0.0,even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful punishment
Yunus,39,0.3976,0.129,0.687,0.183,then ha there not been single city that believed so it faith benefited it except the people of jonah when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment for time
Yunus,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and had your lord willed those on earth would have believed all of them entirely then muhammad would you compel the people in order that they become believer
Yunus,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and it is not for soul to believe except by permission of allah and he will place defilement upon those who will not use reason
Yunus,24,-0.1655,0.104,0.816,0.08,say observe what is in the heaven and earth but of no avail will be sign or warner to people who do not believe
Yunus,30,0.3612,0.0,0.921,0.079,so do they wait except for like what occurred in the day of those who passed on before them say then wait indeed am with you among those who wait
Yunus,23,0.7506,0.0,0.758,0.242,then we will save our messenger and those who have believed thus it is an obligation upon u that we save the believer
Yunus,38,-0.8839,0.278,0.722,0.0,say muhammad people if you are in doubt a to my religion then do not worship those which you worship besides allah but worship allah who cause your death and have been commanded to be of the believer
Yunus,21,0.3182,0.0,0.897,0.103,and commanded direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth and never be of those who associate others with allah
Yunus,26,0.0951,0.085,0.818,0.097,and do not invoke besides allah that which neither benefit you nor harm you for if you did then indeed you would be of the wrongdoer
Yunus,49,-0.0772,0.126,0.753,0.121,and if allah should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he intends for you good then there is no repeller of his bounty he cause it to reach whom he will of his servant and he is the forgiving the merciful
Yunus,41,0.5423,0.067,0.772,0.161,say mankind the truth ha come to you from your lord so whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of his soul and whoever go astray only go astray in violation against it and am not over you manager
Yunus,22,0.6369,0.0,0.833,0.167,and follow what is revealed to you muhammad and be patient until allah will judge and he is the best of judge
Hud,22,0.7783,0.0,0.746,0.254,alif lam ra this is book whose verse are perfected and then presented in detail from one who is wise and acquainted
Hud,20,0.2528,0.083,0.79,0.127,through messenger saying do not worship except allah indeed am to you from him warner and bringer of good tidings
Hud,45,0.5187,0.142,0.611,0.247,and saying seek forgiveness of your lord and repent to him and he will let you enjoy good provision for specified term and give every doer of favor his favor but if you turn away then indeed fear for you the punishment of great day
Hud,12,0.3182,0.0,0.827,0.173,to allah is your return and he is over all thing competent
Hud,40,-0.1779,0.042,0.958,0.0,unquestionably they the disbeliever turn away their breast to hide themselves from him unquestionably even when they cover themselves in their clothing allah know what they conceal and what they declare indeed he is knowing of that within the breast
Hud,30,0.4497,0.048,0.814,0.137,and there is no creature on earth but that upon allah is it provision and he know it place of dwelling and place of storage all is in clear register
Hud,57,-0.0129,0.119,0.733,0.148,and it is he who created the heaven and the earth in six day and his throne had been upon water that he might test you a to which of you is best in deed but if you say indeed you are resurrected after death those who disbelieve will surely say this is not but obvious magic
Hud,45,-0.6096,0.155,0.766,0.079,and if we hold back from them the punishment for limited time they will surely say what detains it unquestionably on the day it come to them it will not be averted from them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
Hud,23,-0.5859,0.227,0.683,0.09,and if we give man taste of mercy from u and then we withdraw it from him indeed he is despairing and ungrateful
Hud,28,0.8519,0.168,0.481,0.35,but if we give him taste of favor after hardship ha touched him he will surely say bad time have left me indeed he is exultant and boastful
Hud,17,0.872,0.0,0.586,0.414,except for those who are patient and do righteous deed those will have forgiveness and great reward
Hud,51,0.25,0.044,0.894,0.063,then would you possibly leave out some of what is revealed to you or is your breast constrained by it because they say why ha there not been sent down to him treasure or come with him an angel but you are only warner and allah is disposer of all thing
Hud,33,0.6705,0.0,0.849,0.151,or do they say he invented it say then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whomever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
Hud,35,-0.296,0.061,0.939,0.0,and if they do not respond to you then know that the qur an wa revealed with the knowledge of allah and that there is no deity except him then would you not be muslim
Hud,25,0.7618,0.0,0.744,0.256,whoever desire the life of this world and it adornment we fully repay them for their deed therein and they therein will not be deprived
Hud,30,-0.872,0.268,0.732,0.0,those are the one for whom there is not in the hereafter but the fire and lost is what they did therein and worthless is what they used to do
Hud,82,0.8428,0.034,0.811,0.155,so is one who stand upon clear evidence from his lord like the aforementioned and witness from him follows it and before it wa the scripture of moses to lead and a mercy those believer in the former revelation believe in the qur an but whoever disbelief in it from the various faction the fire is his promised destination so be not in doubt about it indeed it is the truth from your lord but most of the people do not believe
Hud,42,-0.8655,0.199,0.801,0.0,and who is more unjust than he who invents lie about allah those will be presented before their lord and the witness will say these are the one who lied against their lord unquestionably the curse of allah is upon the wrongdoer
Hud,22,-0.0772,0.058,0.942,0.0,who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they concerning the hereafter were disbeliever
Hud,34,-0.1275,0.084,0.844,0.071,those were not causing failure to allah on earth nor did they have besides allah any protector for them the punishment will be multiplied they were not able to hear nor did they see
Hud,19,-0.5574,0.213,0.787,0.0,those are the one who will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
Hud,13,0.5267,0.168,0.495,0.337,assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the greatest loser
Hud,26,0.6369,0.0,0.856,0.144,indeed they who have believed and done righteous deed and humbled themselves to their lord those are the companion of paradise they will abide eternally therein
Hud,27,0.3612,0.085,0.752,0.163,the example of the two party is like the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing are they equal in comparison then will you not remember
Hud,16,0.6124,0.0,0.737,0.263,and we had certainly sent noah to his people saying indeed am to you clear warner
Hud,15,-0.8803,0.504,0.496,0.0,that you not worship except allah indeed fear for you the punishment of painful day
Hud,58,-0.2263,0.119,0.775,0.106,so the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said we do not see you but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of u and at first suggestion and we do not see in you over u any merit rather we think you are liar
Hud,44,0.7469,0.0,0.827,0.173,he said my people have you considered if should be upon clear evidence from my lord while he ha given me mercy from himself but it ha been made unapparent to you should we force it upon you while you are averse to it
Hud,43,0.0129,0.071,0.836,0.093,and my people ask not of you for it any wealth my reward is not but from allah and am not one to drive away those who have believed indeed they will meet their lord but see that you are people behaving ignorantly
Hud,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,and my people who would protect me from allah if drove them away then will you not be reminded
Hud,63,0.1999,0.032,0.924,0.044,and do not tell you that have the depository containing the provision of allah or that know the unseen nor do tell you that am an angel nor do say of those upon whom your eye look down that allah will never grant them any good allah is most knowing of what is within their soul indeed would then be among the wrongdoer
Hud,28,-0.5719,0.251,0.651,0.098,they said noah you have disputed u and been frequent in dispute of u so bring u what you threaten u if you should be of the truthful
Hud,19,0.4023,0.0,0.869,0.131,he said allah will only bring it to you if he will and you will not cause him failure
Hud,32,-0.6346,0.147,0.853,0.0,and my advice will not benefit you although wished to advise you if allah should intend to put you in error he is your lord and to him you will be returned
Hud,32,-0.2732,0.171,0.685,0.144,or do they say about prophet muhammad he invented it say if have invented it then upon me is the consequence of my crime but am innocent of what crime you commit
Hud,31,0.0341,0.066,0.865,0.07,and it wa revealed to noah that no one will believe from your people except those who have already believed so do not be distressed by what they have been doing
Hud,26,-0.5267,0.205,0.693,0.102,and construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
Hud,36,-0.8885,0.277,0.723,0.0,and he constructed the ship and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him they ridiculed him he said if you ridicule u then we will ridicule you just a you ridicule
Hud,27,-0.8625,0.286,0.714,0.0,and you are going to know who will get punishment that will disgrace him on earth and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment in the hereafter
Hud,47,0.34,0.0,0.93,0.07,so it wa until when our command came and the oven overflowed we said load upon the ship of each creature two mate and your family except those about whom the word ha preceded and include whoever ha believed but none had believed with him except few
Hud,23,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,and noah said embark therein in the name of allah is it course and it anchorage indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
Hud,32,0.3818,0.0,0.89,0.11,and it sailed with them through wave like mountain and noah called to his son who wa apart from them my son come aboard with u and be not with the disbeliever
Hud,44,-0.3612,0.149,0.73,0.121,but he said will take refuge on mountain to protect me from the water noah said there is no protector today from the decree of allah except for whom he give mercy and the wave came between them and he wa among the drowned
Hud,42,0.4588,0.0,0.909,0.091,and it wa said earth swallow your water and sky withhold your rain and the water subsided and the matter wa accomplished and the ship came to rest on the mountain of judiyy and it wa said away with the wrongdoing people
Hud,31,0.6249,0.0,0.85,0.15,and noah called to his lord and said my lord indeed my son is of my family and indeed your promise is true and you are the most just of judge
Hud,41,-0.5106,0.099,0.901,0.0,he said noah indeed he is not of your family indeed he is one whose work wa other than righteous so ask me not for that about which you have no knowledge indeed advise you lest you be among the ignorant
Hud,31,-0.25,0.151,0.726,0.124,noah said my lord seek refuge in you from asking that of which have no knowledge and unless you forgive me and have mercy upon me will be among the loser
Hud,39,0.4215,0.159,0.607,0.234,it wa said noah disembark in security from u and blessing upon you and upon nation descending from those with you but other nation of them we will grant enjoyment then there will touch them from u painful punishment
Hud,36,0.6369,0.0,0.893,0.107,that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you muhammad you knew it not neither you nor your people before this so be patient indeed the best outcome is for the righteous
Hud,28,0.0,0.055,0.89,0.055,and to aad we sent their brother hud he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him you are not but inventor of falsehood
Hud,25,0.8555,0.0,0.701,0.299,my people do not ask you for it any reward my reward is only from the one who created me then will you not reason
Hud,40,0.7506,0.069,0.711,0.22,and my people ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him he will send rain from the sky upon you in shower and increase you in strength added to your strength and do not turn away being criminal
Hud,29,0.0165,0.072,0.822,0.107,they said hud you have not brought u clear evidence and we are not one to leave our god on your say so nor are we believer in you
Hud,32,0.0,0.113,0.747,0.139,we only say that some of our god have possessed you with evil he said indeed call allah to witness and witness yourselves that am free from whatever you associate with allah
Hud,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,other than him so plot against me all together then do not give me respite
Hud,29,0.1901,0.052,0.872,0.076,indeed have relied upon allah my lord and your lord there is no creature but that he hold it forelock indeed my lord is on path that is straight
Hud,42,0.7162,0.0,0.87,0.13,but if they turn away say have already conveyed that with which wa sent to you my lord will give succession to people other than you and you will not harm him at all indeed my lord is over all thing guardian
Hud,25,0.25,0.184,0.572,0.244,and when our command came we saved hud and those who believed with him by mercy from u and we saved them from harsh punishment
Hud,23,-0.6705,0.208,0.792,0.0,and that wa aad who rejected the sign of their lord and disobeyed his messenger and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant
Hud,31,-0.6486,0.18,0.761,0.059,and they were therefore followed in this world with curse and a well on the day of resurrection unquestionably aad denied their lord then away with aad the people of hud
Hud,50,0.7414,0.039,0.794,0.167,and to thamud we sent their brother salih he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him he ha produced you from the earth and settled you in it so ask forgiveness of him and then repent to him indeed my lord is near and responsive
Hud,36,0.6124,0.115,0.649,0.236,they said salih you were among u man of promise before this do you forbid u to worship what our father worshipped and indeed we are about that to which you invite u in disquieting doubt
Hud,42,0.7039,0.085,0.715,0.201,he said my people have you considered if should be upon clear evidence from my lord and he ha given me mercy from himself who would protect me from allah if disobeyed him so you would not increase me except in loss
Hud,38,-0.7717,0.157,0.843,0.0,and my people this is the she camel of allah she is to you sign so let her feed upon allah earth and do not touch her with harm or you will be taken by an impending punishment
Hud,22,0.8946,0.0,0.639,0.361,but they hamstrung her so he said enjoy yourselves in your home for three day that is promise not to be denied
Hud,40,0.7717,0.067,0.707,0.227,so when our command came we saved salih and those who believed with him by mercy from u and saved them from the disgrace of that day indeed it is your lord who is the powerful the exalted in might
Hud,17,-0.6597,0.265,0.735,0.0,and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their home corps fallen prone
Hud,16,-0.4404,0.172,0.828,0.0,a if they had never prospered therein unquestionably thamud denied their lord then away with thamud
Hud,26,0.9226,0.0,0.596,0.404,and certainly did our messenger come to abraham with good tidings they said peace he said peace and did not delay in bringing them roasted calf
Hud,31,-0.8919,0.33,0.575,0.095,but when he saw their hand not reaching for it he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension they said fear not we have been sent to the people of lot
Hud,20,0.7506,0.0,0.738,0.262,and his wife wa standing and she smiled then we gave her good tidings of isaac and after isaac jacob
Hud,27,0.25,0.089,0.791,0.12,she said woe to me shall give birth while am an old woman and this my husband is an old man indeed this is an amazing thing
Hud,31,0.9432,0.0,0.619,0.381,they said are you amazed at the decree of allah may the mercy of allah and his blessing be upon you people of the house indeed he is praiseworthy and honorable
Hud,25,-0.1779,0.171,0.683,0.147,and when the fright had left abraham and the good tidings had reached him he began to argue with u concerning the people of lot
Hud,10,-0.5106,0.268,0.732,0.0,indeed abraham wa forbearing grieving and frequently returning to allah
Hud,27,-0.1779,0.104,0.782,0.114,the angel said abraham give up this plea indeed the command of your lord ha come and indeed there will reach them punishment that cannot be repelled
Hud,26,-0.128,0.171,0.703,0.125,and when our messenger the angel came to lot he wa anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said this is trying day
Hud,48,-0.7838,0.152,0.802,0.047,and his people came hastening to him and before this they had been doing evil deed he said my people these are my daughter they are purer for you so fear allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guest is there not among you man of reason
Hud,22,0.0772,0.0,0.942,0.058,they said you have already known that we have not concerning your daughter any claim and indeed you know what we want
Hud,16,0.7184,0.0,0.7,0.3,he said if only had against you some power or could take refuge in strong support
Hud,61,-0.3765,0.073,0.927,0.0,the angel said lot indeed we are messenger of your lord therefore they will never reach you so set out with your family during portion of the night and let not any among you look back except your wife indeed she will be struck by that which strike them indeed their appointment is for the morning is not the morning near
Hud,26,-0.4588,0.143,0.857,0.0,so when our command came we made the highest part of the city it lowest and rained upon them stone of layered hard clay which were
Hud,14,-0.4939,0.198,0.802,0.0,marked from your lord and allah punishment is not from the wrongdoer very far
Hud,49,-0.8625,0.18,0.792,0.028,and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said my people worship allah you have no deity other than him and do not decrease from the measure and the scale indeed see you in prosperity but indeed fear for you the punishment of an all encompassing day
Hud,29,0.8143,0.052,0.69,0.257,and my people give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
Hud,20,0.3818,0.0,0.88,0.12,what remains lawful from allah is best for you if you would be believer but am not guardian over you
Hud,33,0.7579,0.032,0.765,0.203,they said shu ayb doe your prayer command you that we should leave what our father worship or not do with our wealth what we please indeed you are the forbearing the discerning
Hud,63,0.5994,0.029,0.852,0.119,he said my people have you considered if am upon clear evidence from my lord and he ha provided me with good provision from him and do not intend to differ from you in that which have forbidden you only intend reform a much a am able and my success is not but through allah upon him have relied and to him return
Hud,45,-0.4588,0.085,0.915,0.0,and my people let not your dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of noah or the people of hud or the people of salih and the people of lot are not from you far away
Hud,18,0.6124,0.0,0.762,0.238,and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him indeed my lord is merciful and affectionate
Hud,43,-0.8539,0.202,0.798,0.0,they said shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say and indeed we consider you among u a weak and if not for your family we would have stoned you to death and you are not to u one respected
Hud,33,-0.4221,0.108,0.833,0.059,he said my people is my family more respected for power by you than allah but you put him behind your back in neglect indeed my lord is encompassing of what you do
Hud,39,-0.8658,0.212,0.788,0.0,and my people work according to your position indeed am working you are going to know to whom will come punishment that will disgrace him and who is liar so watch indeed am with you watcher awaiting the outcome
Hud,36,-0.0258,0.129,0.743,0.127,and when our command came we saved shu ayb and those who believed with him by mercy from u and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their home corps fallen prone
Hud,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a if they had never prospered therein then away with madyan a thamud wa taken away
Hud,12,0.6486,0.0,0.588,0.412,and we did certainly send moses with our sign and clear authority
Hud,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to pharaoh and his establishment but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh wa not at all discerning
Hud,26,-0.34,0.088,0.912,0.0,he will precede his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire and wretched is the place to which they are led
Hud,23,-0.1531,0.128,0.766,0.106,and they were followed in this world with curse and on the day of resurrection and wretched is the gift which is given
Hud,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is from the news of the city which we relate to you of them some are still standing and some are a harvest mowed down
Hud,44,-0.8429,0.209,0.71,0.081,and we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves and they were not availed at all by their god which they invoked other than allah when there came the command of your lord and they did not increase them in other than ruin
Hud,25,-0.8074,0.278,0.68,0.042,and thus is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the city while they are committing wrong indeed his seizure is painful and severe
Hud,32,-0.7506,0.176,0.824,0.0,indeed in that is sign for those who fear the punishment of the hereafter that is day for which the people will be collected and that is day which will be witnessed

Hud,42,-0.8591,0.207,0.755,0.038,so why were there not among the generation before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth except few of those we saved from among them but those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein and they were criminal
Hud,15,0.3875,0.0,0.842,0.158,and your lord would not have destroyed the city unjustly while their people were reformer
Hud,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if your lord had willed he could have made mankind one community but they will not cease to differ
Hud,34,0.4767,0.136,0.597,0.267,except whom your lord ha given mercy and for that he created them but the word of your lord is to be fulfilled that will surely fill hell with jinni and men all together

Hud,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and wait indeed we are waiting

Yusuf,11,0.3818,0.0,0.794,0.206,alif lam ra these are the verse of the clear book
Yusuf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we have sent it down a an arabic qur an that you might understand
Yusuf,28,0.5267,0.056,0.812,0.131,we relate to you muhammad the best of story in what we have revealed to you of this qur an although you were before it among the unaware
Yusuf,30,0.25,0.0,0.935,0.065,of these story mention when joseph said to his father my father indeed have seen in dream eleven star and the sun and the moon saw them prostrating to me
Yusuf,26,-0.6416,0.179,0.821,0.0,he said my son do not relate your vision to your brother or they will contrive against you plan indeed satan to man is manifest enemy
Yusuf,44,0.7003,0.0,0.876,0.124,and thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narrative and complete his favor upon you and upon the family of jacob a he completed it upon your father before abraham and isaac indeed your lord is knowing and wise
Yusuf,13,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,certainly were there in joseph and his brother sign for those who ask
Yusuf,26,0.5413,0.085,0.721,0.194,when they said joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we while we are clan indeed our father is in clear error
Yusuf,28,-0.6908,0.148,0.852,0.0,kill joseph or cast him out to another land the countenance of your father will then be only for you and you will be after that righteous people
Yusuf,28,0.6148,0.0,0.838,0.162,said speaker among them do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well some traveler will pick him up if you would do something
Yusuf,20,0.4019,0.0,0.87,0.13,they said our father why do you not entrust u with joseph while indeed we are to him sincere counselor
Yusuf,19,0.5423,0.0,0.78,0.22,send him with u tomorrow that he may eat well and play and indeed we will be his guardian
Yusuf,24,-0.7845,0.273,0.727,0.0,jacob said indeed it saddens me that you should take him and fear that wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware
Yusuf,18,-0.0258,0.15,0.705,0.145,they said if wolf should eat him while we are strong clan indeed we would then be loser
Yusuf,40,0.882,0.0,0.762,0.238,so when they took him out and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well but we inspired to him you will surely inform them someday about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive your identity
Yusuf,9,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,and they came to their father at night weeping
Yusuf,31,0.6124,0.0,0.879,0.121,they said our father indeed we went racing each other and left joseph with our possession and wolf ate him but you would not believe u even if we were truthful
Yusuf,36,0.4019,0.0,0.928,0.072,and they brought upon his shirt false blood jacob said rather your soul have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting and allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe
Yusuf,41,0.4404,0.0,0.931,0.069,and there came company of traveler then they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket he said good news here is boy and they concealed him taking him a merchandise and allah wa knowing of what they did
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they sold him for reduced price few dirham and they were concerning him of those content with little
Yusuf,60,0.5423,0.0,0.909,0.091,and the one from egypt who bought him said to his wife make his residence comfortable perhaps he will benefit u or we will adopt him a son and thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of event and allah is predominant over his affair but most of the people do not know
Yusuf,19,0.7906,0.0,0.667,0.333,and when joseph reached maturity we gave him judgment and knowledge and thus we reward the doer of good
Yusuf,42,0.3964,0.056,0.831,0.113,and she in whose house he wa sought to seduce him she closed the door and said come you he said seek the refuge of allah indeed he is my master who ha made good my residence indeed wrongdoer will not succeed
Yusuf,43,-0.4404,0.152,0.752,0.095,and she certainly determined to seduce him and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his lord and thus it wa that we should avert from him evil and immorality indeed he wa of our chosen servant
Yusuf,45,-0.9418,0.266,0.734,0.0,and they both raced to the door and she tore his shirt from the back and they found her husband at the door she said what is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or painful punishment
Yusuf,36,-0.1531,0.126,0.762,0.112,joseph said it wa she who sought to seduce me and witness from her family testified if his shirt is torn from the front then she ha told the truth and he is of the liar
Yusuf,19,0.296,0.211,0.536,0.254,but if his shirt is torn from the back then she ha lied and he is of the truthful
Yusuf,25,0.4767,0.069,0.79,0.141,so when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back he said indeed it is of the woman plan indeed your plan is great
Yusuf,17,-0.8225,0.391,0.524,0.085,joseph ignore this and my wife ask forgiveness for your sin indeed you were of the sinful
Yusuf,33,0.7579,0.066,0.709,0.225,and woman in the city said the wife of al azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy he ha impassioned her with love indeed we see her to be in clear error
Yusuf,59,0.3456,0.072,0.803,0.124,so when she heard of their scheming she sent for them and prepared for them banquet and gave each one of them knife and said to joseph come out before them and when they saw him they greatly admired him and cut their hand and said perfect is allah this is not man this is none but noble angel
Yusuf,41,-0.5106,0.176,0.714,0.11,she said that is the one about whom you blamed me and certainly sought to seduce him but he firmly refused and if he will not do what order him he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased
Yusuf,37,-0.0819,0.124,0.736,0.14,he said my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me and if you do not avert from me their plan might incline toward them and thus be of the ignorant
Yusuf,19,-0.0772,0.067,0.933,0.0,so his lord responded to him and averted from him their plan indeed he is the hearing the knowing
Yusuf,20,0.4404,0.0,0.868,0.132,then it appeared to them after they had seen the sign that al azeez should surely imprison him for time
Yusuf,57,0.1531,0.054,0.866,0.08,and there entered the prison with him two young men one of them said indeed have seen myself in dream pressing wine the other said indeed have seen myself carrying upon my head some bread from which the bird were eating inform u of it interpretation indeed we see you to be of those who do good
Yusuf,54,0.34,0.0,0.957,0.043,he said you will not receive food that is provided to you except that will inform you of it interpretation before it come to you that is from what my lord ha taught me indeed have left the religion of people who do not believe in allah and they in the hereafter are disbeliever
Yusuf,44,-0.3335,0.071,0.888,0.041,and have followed the religion of my father abraham isaac and jacob and it wa not for u to associate anything with allah that is from the favor of allah upon u and upon the people but most of the people are not grateful
Yusuf,15,-0.1027,0.172,0.677,0.151,my two companion of prison are separate lord better or allah the one the prevailing
Yusuf,52,0.775,0.028,0.794,0.179,you worship not besides him except mere name you have named them you and your father for which allah ha sent down no authority legislation is not but for allah he ha commanded that you worship not except him that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know
Yusuf,45,0.2732,0.046,0.862,0.092,two companion of prison a for one of you he will give drink to his master of wine but a for the other he will be crucified and the bird will eat from his head the matter ha been decreed about which you both inquire
Yusuf,34,-0.6858,0.17,0.776,0.054,and he said to the one whom he knew would go free mention me before your master but satan made him forget the mention to his master and joseph remained in prison several year
Yusuf,43,0.6124,0.0,0.87,0.13,and subsequently the king said indeed have seen in dream seven fat cow being eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spike of grain and others that were dry eminent one explain to me my vision if you should interpret vision
Yusuf,19,0.6124,0.0,0.773,0.227,they said it is but mixture of false dream and we are not learned in the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,21,0.5499,0.0,0.849,0.151,but the one who wa freed and remembered after time said will inform you of it interpretation so send me forth
Yusuf,42,0.3182,0.0,0.946,0.054,he said joseph man of truth explain to u about seven fat cow eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spike of grain and others that were dry that may return to the people perhaps they will know about you
Yusuf,24,-0.0516,0.05,0.95,0.0,joseph said you will plant for seven year consecutively and what you harvest leave in it spike except little from which you will eat
Yusuf,23,0.0772,0.095,0.798,0.106,then will come after that seven difficult year which will consume what you saved for them except little from which you will store
Yusuf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then will come after that year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press olive and grape
Yusuf,43,0.3919,0.055,0.855,0.09,and the king said bring him to me but when the messenger came to him joseph said return to your master and ask him what is the case of the woman who cut their hand indeed my lord is knowing of their plan
Yusuf,53,0.5859,0.102,0.723,0.175,said the king to the woman what wa your condition when you sought to seduce joseph they said perfect is allah we know about him no evil the wife of al azeez said now the truth ha become evident it wa who sought to seduce him and indeed he is of the truthful
Yusuf,25,0.5216,0.0,0.877,0.123,that is so al azeez will know that did not betray him in his absence and that allah doe not guide the plan of betrayer
Yusuf,28,0.2042,0.163,0.625,0.212,and do not acquit myself indeed the soul is persistent enjoiner of evil except those upon which my lord ha mercy indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
Yusuf,31,0.4767,0.0,0.906,0.094,and the king said bring him to me will appoint him exclusively for myself and when he spoke to him he said indeed you are today established in position and trusted
Yusuf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,joseph said appoint me over the storehouse of the land indeed will be knowing guardian
Yusuf,37,0.7298,0.088,0.71,0.202,and thus we established joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed we touch with our mercy whom we will and we do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
Yusuf,16,0.4404,0.159,0.558,0.283,and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing allah
Yusuf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the brother of joseph came seeking food and they entered upon him and he recognized them but he wa to them unknown
Yusuf,34,0.6369,0.0,0.887,0.113,and when he had furnished them with their supply he said bring me brother of yours from your father do not you see that give full measure and that am the best of accommodator
Yusuf,24,-0.4215,0.109,0.891,0.0,but if you do not bring him to me no measure will there be hereafter for you from me nor will you approach me
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we will attempt to dissuade his father from keeping him and indeed we will do it
Yusuf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and joseph said to his servant put their merchandise into their saddlebag so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will again return
Yusuf,37,-0.128,0.076,0.862,0.063,so when they returned to their father they said our father further measure ha been denied to u so send with u our brother that we will be given measure and indeed we will be his guardian
Yusuf,32,0.802,0.0,0.801,0.199,he said should entrust you with him except under coercion a entrusted you with his brother before but allah is the best guardian and he is the most merciful of the merciful
Yusuf,53,0.8678,0.0,0.817,0.183,and when they opened their baggage they found their merchandise returned to them they said our father what more could we desire this is our merchandise returned to u and we will obtain supply for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of camel load that is an easy measurement
Yusuf,46,0.0258,0.068,0.841,0.09,jacob said never will send him with you until you give me promise by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you should be surrounded by enemy and when they had given their promise he said allah over what we say is witness
Yusuf,47,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he said my son do not enter from one gate but enter from different gate and cannot avail you against the decree of allah at all the decision is only for allah upon him have relied and upon him let those who would rely indeed rely
Yusuf,54,0.2263,0.0,0.965,0.035,and when they entered from where their father had ordered them it did not avail them against allah at all except it wa need within the soul of jacob which he satisfied and indeed he wa possessor of knowledge because of what we had taught him but most of the people do not know
Yusuf,30,0.3017,0.0,0.929,0.071,and when they entered upon joseph he took his brother to himself he said indeed am your brother so do not despair over what they used to do to me
Yusuf,31,-0.5267,0.102,0.898,0.0,so when he had furnished them with their supply he put the gold measuring bowl into the bag of his brother then an announcer called out caravan indeed you are thief
Yusuf,11,-0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,they said while approaching them what is it you are missing
Yusuf,27,0.5859,0.068,0.745,0.186,they said we are missing the measure of the king and for he who produce it is the reward of camel load and am responsible for it
Yusuf,25,0.6341,0.0,0.816,0.184,they said by allah you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land and we have not been thief
Yusuf,14,-0.5106,0.202,0.798,0.0,the accuser said then what would be it recompense if you should be liar
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the brother said it recompense is that he in whose bag it is found he himself will be it recompense thus do we recompense the wrongdoer
Yusuf,64,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he began the search with their bag before the bag of his brother then he extracted it from the bag of his brother thus did we plan for joseph he could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that allah willed we raise in degree whom we will but over every possessor of knowledge is one more knowing
Yusuf,40,-0.7684,0.181,0.782,0.037,they said if he steal brother of his ha stolen before but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them he said you are worse in position and allah is most knowing of what you describe
Yusuf,29,0.6486,0.0,0.825,0.175,they said azeez indeed he ha father who is an old man so take one of u in place of him indeed we see you a doer of good
Yusuf,26,-0.4939,0.116,0.845,0.039,he said seek the refuge of allah to prevent that we take except him with whom we found our possession indeed we would then be unjust
Yusuf,66,0.003,0.092,0.803,0.105,so when they had despaired of him they secluded themselves in private consultation the eldest of them said do you not know that your father ha taken upon you an oath by allah and that before you failed in your duty to joseph so will never leave this land until my father permit me or allah decides for me and he is the best of judge
Yusuf,31,-0.2023,0.092,0.838,0.069,return to your father and say our father indeed your son ha stolen and we did not testify except to what we knew and we were not witness of the unseen
Yusuf,20,0.4588,0.0,0.864,0.136,and ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came and indeed we are truthful
Yusuf,34,0.4767,0.0,0.914,0.086,jacob said rather your soul have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting perhaps allah will bring them to me all together indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
Yusuf,26,-0.765,0.216,0.784,0.0,and he turned away from them and said oh my sorrow over joseph and his eye became white from grief for he wa of that suppressor
Yusuf,21,-0.7906,0.269,0.731,0.0,they said by allah you will not cease remembering joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish
Yusuf,22,-0.8316,0.317,0.683,0.0,he said only complain of my suffering and my grief to allah and know from allah that which you do not know
Yusuf,30,-0.8723,0.323,0.677,0.0,my son go and find out about joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from allah indeed no one despair of relief from allah except the disbelieving people
Yusuf,40,0.9161,0.079,0.603,0.318,so when they entered upon joseph they said azeez adversity ha touched u and our family and we have come with good poor in quality but give u full measure and be charitable to u indeed allah reward the charitable
Yusuf,17,-0.2732,0.116,0.884,0.0,he said do you know what you did with joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
Yusuf,44,0.7926,0.127,0.621,0.252,they said are you indeed joseph he said am joseph and this is my brother allah ha certainly favored u indeed he who fear allah and is patient then indeed allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
Yusuf,17,0.5859,0.0,0.745,0.255,they said by allah certainly ha allah preferred you over u and indeed we have been sinner
Yusuf,23,-0.3612,0.172,0.749,0.079,he said no blame will there be upon you today allah will forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
Yusuf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,take this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will become seeing and bring me your family all together
Yusuf,32,0.5517,0.0,0.868,0.132,and when the caravan departed from egypt their father said indeed find the smell of joseph and would say that he wa alive if you did not think me weakened in mind
Yusuf,12,-0.4019,0.197,0.803,0.0,they said by allah indeed you are in your same old error
Yusuf,36,0.4404,0.0,0.923,0.077,and when the bearer of good tidings arrived he cast it over his face and he returned once again seeing he said did not tell you that know from allah that which you do not know
Yusuf,16,-0.3612,0.193,0.695,0.112,they said our father ask for u forgiveness of our sin indeed we have been sinner
Yusuf,20,0.6124,0.0,0.783,0.217,he said will ask forgiveness for you from my lord indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful
Yusuf,21,0.6486,0.0,0.782,0.218,and when they entered upon joseph he took his parent to himself and said enter egypt allah willing safe and secure
Yusuf,85,0.8176,0.035,0.831,0.135,and he raised his parent upon the throne and they bowed to him in prostration and he said my father this is the explanation of my vision of before my lord ha made it reality and he wa certainly good to me when he took me out of prison and brought you here from bedouin life after satan had induced estrangement between me and my brother indeed my lord is subtle in what he will indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
Yusuf,45,0.3818,0.074,0.782,0.143,my lord you have given me something of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dream creator of the heaven and earth you are my protector in this world and in the hereafter cause me to die muslim and join me with the righteous
Yusuf,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal muhammad to you and you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired
Yusuf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and most of the people although you strive for it are not believer
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and you do not ask of them for it any payment it is not except reminder to the world
Yusuf,19,0.5106,0.0,0.845,0.155,and how many sign within the heaven and earth do they pas over while they therefrom are turning away
Yusuf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and most of them believe not in allah except while they associate others with him
Yusuf,35,-0.2023,0.083,0.855,0.062,then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming aspect of the punishment of allah or that the hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive
Yusuf,29,0.1531,0.0,0.946,0.054,say this is my way invite to allah with insight and those who follow me and exalted is allah and am not of those who associate others with him

An-Nahl,13,0.1779,0.223,0.514,0.263,he created man from sperm drop then at once he is clear adversary
An-Nahl,21,0.8555,0.0,0.62,0.38,and the grazing livestock he ha created for you in them is warmth and numerous benefit and from them you eat
An-Nahl,26,0.8126,0.0,0.764,0.236,and for you in them is the enjoyment of beauty when you bring them in for the evening and when you send them out to pasture
An-Nahl,24,0.1788,0.132,0.747,0.121,and they carry your load to land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves indeed your lord is kind and merciful
An-Nahl,24,0.6597,0.0,0.758,0.242,and he created the horse mule and donkey for you to ride and a adornment and he creates that which you do not know
An-Nahl,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and upon allah is the direction of the right way and among the various path are those deviating and if he willed he could have guided you all
An-Nahl,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it is he who sends down rain from the sky from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture animal
An-Nahl,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he cause to grow for you thereby the crop olive palm tree grapevine and from all the fruit indeed in that is sign for people who give thought
An-Nahl,32,0.34,0.0,0.928,0.072,and he ha subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon and the star are subjected by his command indeed in that are sign for people who reason
An-Nahl,24,0.34,0.0,0.906,0.094,and he ha subjected whatever he multiplied for you on the earth of varying color indeed in that is sign for people who remember
An-Nahl,50,0.4588,0.0,0.942,0.058,and it is he who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornament which you wear and you see the ship plowing through it and he subjected it that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
An-Nahl,25,0.34,0.0,0.909,0.091,and he ha cast into the earth firmly set mountain lest it shift with you and made river and road that you may be guided
An-Nahl,10,0.0772,0.0,0.874,0.126,and landmark and by the star they are also guided
An-Nahl,17,0.4188,0.089,0.686,0.225,then is he who creates like one who doe not create so will you not be reminded
An-Nahl,20,0.6808,0.0,0.763,0.237,and if you should count the favor of allah you could not enumerate them indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
An-Nahl,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and allah know what you conceal and what you declare
An-Nahl,14,0.4767,0.0,0.745,0.255,and those they invoke other than allah create nothing and they themselves are created
An-Nahl,17,-0.7568,0.302,0.698,0.0,they are in fact dead not alive and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
An-Nahl,22,-0.4939,0.163,0.72,0.117,your god is one god but those who do not believe in the hereafter their heart are disapproving and they are arrogant
An-Nahl,17,0.4798,0.099,0.656,0.245,assuredly allah know what they conceal and what they declare indeed he doe not like the arrogant
An-Nahl,20,0.34,0.0,0.888,0.112,and when it is said to them what ha your lord sent down they say legend of the former people
An-Nahl,33,-0.3147,0.148,0.763,0.089,that they may bear their own burden in full on the day of resurrection and some of the burden of those whom they misguide without knowledge unquestionably evil is that which they bear
An-Nahl,36,-0.6486,0.109,0.891,0.0,those before them had already plotted but allah came at their building from the foundation so the roof fell upon them from above them and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive
An-Nahl,41,-0.8957,0.221,0.779,0.0,then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my partner for whom you used to oppose the believer those who were given knowledge will say indeed disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbeliever
An-Nahl,35,0.52,0.061,0.795,0.144,the one whom the angel take in death while wronging themselves and who then offer submission saying we were not doing any evil but yes indeed allah is knowing of what you used to do
An-Nahl,19,-0.8316,0.315,0.685,0.0,so enter the gate of hell to abide eternally therein and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant
An-Nahl,50,0.9022,0.051,0.704,0.245,and it will be said to those who feared allah what did your lord send down they will say that which is good for those who do good in this world is good and the home of the hereafter is better and how excellent is the home of the righteous
An-Nahl,25,0.7506,0.0,0.782,0.218,garden of perpetual residence which they will enter beneath which river flow they will have therein whatever they wish thus doe allah reward the righteous
An-Nahl,28,0.7717,0.101,0.623,0.275,the one whom the angel take in death being good and pure the angel will say peace be upon you enter paradise for what you used to do
An-Nahl,38,-0.1901,0.05,0.92,0.031,do the disbeliever await anything except that the angel should come to them or there come the command of your lord thus did those do before them and allah wronged them not but they had been wronging themselves
An-Nahl,21,-0.8646,0.349,0.651,0.0,so they were struck by the evil consequence of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
An-Nahl,54,-0.4936,0.098,0.859,0.044,and those who associate others with allah say if allah had willed we would not have worshipped anything other than him neither we nor our father nor would we have forbidden anything through other than him thus did those do before them so is there upon the messenger except the duty of clear notification
An-Nahl,47,-0.4215,0.137,0.778,0.085,and we certainly sent into every nation messenger saying worship allah and avoid taghut and among them were those whom allah guided and among them were those upon whom error wa deservedly decreed so proceed through the earth and observe how wa the end of the denier
An-Nahl,24,0.0516,0.083,0.827,0.09,even if you should strive for their guidance muhammad indeed allah doe not guide those he sends astray and they will have no helper
An-Nahl,33,0.9011,0.027,0.679,0.295,and they swear by allah their strongest oath that allah will not resurrect one who dy but yes it is true promise binding upon him but most of the people do not know
An-Nahl,28,0.1531,0.099,0.753,0.148,it is so he will make clear to them the truth of that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liar
An-Nahl,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed our word to thing when we intend it is but that we say to it be and it is
An-Nahl,38,0.882,0.041,0.7,0.259,and those who emigrated for the cause of allah after they had been wronged we will surely settle them in this world in good place but the reward of the hereafter is greater if only they could know
An-Nahl,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they are those who endured patiently and upon their lord relied
An-Nahl,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed our message so ask the people of the message if you do not know
An-Nahl,36,0.6369,0.0,0.867,0.133,we sent them with clear proof and written ordinance and we revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what wa sent down to them and that they might give thought
An-Nahl,35,-0.7351,0.181,0.762,0.057,then do those who have planned evil deed feel secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive
An-Nahl,17,0.4023,0.0,0.856,0.144,or that he would not seize them during their usual activity and they could not cause failure
An-Nahl,20,0.5574,0.081,0.732,0.187,or that he would not seize them gradually in state of dread but indeed your lord is kind and merciful
An-Nahl,26,0.5267,0.0,0.845,0.155,have they not considered what thing allah ha created their shadow incline to the right and to the left prostrating to allah while they are humble
An-Nahl,27,0.7922,0.0,0.741,0.259,and to allah prostrates whatever is in the heaven and whatever is on the earth of creature and the angel a well and they are not arrogant
An-Nahl,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
An-Nahl,20,-0.5146,0.21,0.629,0.161,and allah ha said do not take for yourselves two deity he is but one god so fear only me
An-Nahl,28,0.3182,0.095,0.742,0.163,and to him belongs whatever is in the heaven and the earth and to him is due worship constantly then is it other than allah that you fear
An-Nahl,21,-0.128,0.208,0.601,0.191,and whatever you have of favor it is from allah then when adversity touch you to him you cry for help
An-Nahl,18,-0.0258,0.13,0.744,0.126,then when he remove the adversity from you at once party of you associate others with their lord
An-Nahl,18,0.1372,0.122,0.732,0.146,so they will deny what we have given them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know
An-Nahl,30,0.3612,0.043,0.867,0.09,and they assign to what they do not know portion of that which we have provided them by allah you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent
An-Nahl,16,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,and they attribute to allah daughter exalted is he and for them is what they desire
An-Nahl,20,-0.4939,0.144,0.856,0.0,and when one of them is informed of the birth of female his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
An-Nahl,34,-0.8807,0.286,0.659,0.055,he hide himself from the people because of the ill of which he ha been informed should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground unquestionably evil is what they decide
An-Nahl,29,-0.3182,0.128,0.783,0.09,for those who do not believe in the hereafter is the description of evil and for allah is the highest attribute and he is exalted in might the wise
An-Nahl,48,0.2023,0.064,0.875,0.06,and if allah were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing he would not have left upon the earth any creature but he defers them for specified term and when their term ha come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
An-Nahl,35,-0.1531,0.186,0.664,0.15,and they attribute to allah that which they dislike and their tongue assert the lie that they will have the best from him assuredly they will have the fire and they will be therein neglected
An-Nahl,34,-0.2382,0.184,0.631,0.185,by allah we did certainly send messenger to nation before you but satan made their deed attractive to them and he is the disbeliever ally today a well and they will have painful punishment
An-Nahl,32,0.6249,0.0,0.85,0.15,and we have not revealed to you the book muhammad except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and a guidance and mercy for people who believe
An-Nahl,28,0.34,0.0,0.918,0.082,and allah ha sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after it lifelessness indeed in that is sign for people who listen
An-Nahl,28,0.3818,0.0,0.912,0.088,and indeed for you in grazing livestock is lesson we give you drink from what is in their belly between excretion and blood pure milk palatable to drinker
An-Nahl,25,0.4404,0.0,0.892,0.108,and from the fruit of the palm tree and grapevine you take intoxicant and good provision indeed in that is sign for people who reason
An-Nahl,24,0.4939,0.0,0.878,0.122,and your lord inspired to the bee take for yourself among the mountain house and among the tree and in that which they construct
An-Nahl,43,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then eat from all the fruit and follow the way of your lord laid down for you there emerges from their belly drink varying in color in which there is healing for people indeed in that is sign for people who give thought
An-Nahl,42,-0.1531,0.083,0.826,0.091,and allah created you then he will take you in death and among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit old age so that he will not know after having had knowledge thing indeed allah is knowing and competent
An-Nahl,46,-0.1491,0.173,0.647,0.18,and allah ha favored some of you over others in provision but those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hand posse so they would be equal to them therein then is it the favor of allah they reject
An-Nahl,43,0.8625,0.042,0.712,0.246,and allah ha made for you from yourselves mate and ha made for you from your mate son and grandchild and ha provided for you from the good thing then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allah they disbelieve
An-Nahl,30,0.6705,0.0,0.836,0.164,and they worship besides allah that which doe not posse for them the power of provision from the heaven and the earth at all and in fact they are unable
An-Nahl,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so do not assert similarity to allah indeed allah know and you do not know
An-Nahl,46,0.5023,0.0,0.91,0.09,allah present an example slave who is owned and unable to do thing and he to whom we have provided from u good provision so he spends from it secretly and publicly can they be equal praise to allah but most of them do not know
An-Nahl,46,-0.0516,0.148,0.707,0.145,and allah present an example of two men one of them dumb and unable to do thing while he is burden to his guardian wherever he directs him he brings no good is he equal to one who command justice while he is on straight path
An-Nahl,37,0.6249,0.0,0.87,0.13,and to allah belongs the unseen aspect of the heaven and the earth and the command for the hour is not but a glance of the eye or even nearer indeed allah is over all thing competent
An-Nahl,30,0.8555,0.0,0.714,0.286,and allah ha extracted you from the womb of your mother not knowing thing and he made for you hearing and vision and intellect that perhaps you would be grateful
An-Nahl,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they not see the bird controlled in the atmosphere of the sky none hold them up except allah indeed in that are sign for people who believe
An-Nahl,50,0.6486,0.031,0.859,0.11,and allah ha made for you from your home place of rest and made for you from the hide of the animal tent which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment and from their wool fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for time

Al-Isra,27,0.6124,0.0,0.833,0.167,that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our verse and said when we are bone and crumbled particle will we truly be resurrected in new creation
Al-Isra,42,0.128,0.126,0.697,0.177,do they not see that allah who created the heaven and earth is the one able to create the like of them and he ha appointed for them term about which there is no doubt but the wrongdoer refuse anything except disbelief

Al-Kahf,22,0.8126,0.0,0.693,0.307,all praise is due to allah who ha sent down upon his servant the book and ha not made therein any deviance
Al-Kahf,30,0.765,0.167,0.512,0.321,he ha made it straight to warn of severe punishment from him and to give good tidings to the believer who do righteous deed that they will have good reward
Al-Kahf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in which they will remain forever
Al-Kahf,10,0.25,0.119,0.678,0.203,and to warn those who say allah ha taken son

Al-Kahf,26,0.6124,0.0,0.815,0.185,mention when the youth retreated to the cave and said our lord grant u from yourself mercy and prepare for u from our affair right guidance
Al-Kahf,16,0.0772,0.0,0.92,0.08,so we cast cover of sleep over their ear within the cave for number of year
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we awakened them that we might show which of the two faction wa most precise in calculating what extent they had remained in time
Al-Kahf,27,0.5267,0.0,0.85,0.15,it is we who relate to you muhammad their story in truth indeed they were youth who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,40,0.6908,0.0,0.87,0.13,and we made firm their heart when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth never will we invoke besides him any deity we would have certainly spoken then an excessive transgression
Al-Kahf,31,-0.3779,0.151,0.742,0.107,these our people have taken besides him deity why do they not bring for worship of them clear authority and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah lie
Al-Kahf,44,0.6705,0.0,0.863,0.137,the youth said to one another and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allah retreat to the cave your lord will spread out for you of his mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility
Al-Kahf,70,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and had you been present you would see the sun when it rose inclining away from their cave on the right and when it set passing away from them on the left while they were laying within an open space thereof that wa from the sign of allah he whom allah guide is the rightly guided but he whom he leaf astray never will you find for him protecting guide
Al-Kahf,51,-0.5267,0.064,0.936,0.0,and you would think them awake while they were asleep and we turned them to the right and to the left while their dog stretched his foreleg at the entrance if you had looked at them you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror
Al-Kahf,88,0.3818,0.039,0.916,0.045,and similarly we awakened them that they might question one another said speaker from among them how long have you remained here they said we have remained day or part of day they said your lord is most knowing of how long you remained so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious and let no one be aware of you
Al-Kahf,25,-0.3875,0.099,0.901,0.0,indeed if they come to know of you they will stone you or return you to their religion and never would you succeed then ever
Al-Kahf,71,0.128,0.089,0.803,0.108,and similarly we caused them to be found that they who found them would know that the promise of allah is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt that wa when they disputed among themselves about their affair and then said construct over them structure their lord is most knowing about them said those who prevailed in the matter we will surely take for ourselves over them masjid
Al-Kahf,83,0.0257,0.029,0.929,0.042,they will say there were three the fourth of them being their dog and they will say there were five the sixth of them being their dog guessing at the unseen and they will say there were seven and the eighth of them wa their dog say muhammad my lord is most knowing of their number none know them except few so do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among the speculator from anyone
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and never say of anything indeed will do that tomorrow
Al-Kahf,31,-0.2263,0.06,0.94,0.0,except when adding if allah will and remember your lord when you forget it and say perhaps my lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they remained in their cave for three hundred year and exceeded by nine
Al-Kahf,45,0.7845,0.0,0.842,0.158,say allah is most knowing of how long they remained he ha knowledge of the unseen aspect of the heaven and the earth how seeing is he and how hearing they have not besides him any protector and he share not his legislation with anyone
Al-Kahf,32,0.0516,0.064,0.867,0.069,and recite muhammad what ha been revealed to you of the book of your lord there is no changer of his word and never will you find in other than him refuge
Al-Kahf,62,0.25,0.045,0.881,0.075,and keep yourself patient by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his countenance and let not your eye pas beyond them desiring adornment of the worldly life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever in neglect
Al-Kahf,62,0.34,0.119,0.716,0.164,and say the truth is from your lord so whoever will let him believe and whoever will let him disbelieve indeed we have prepared for the wrongdoer fire whose wall will surround them and if they call for relief they will be relieved with water like murky oil which scald their face wretched is the drink and evil is the resting place
Al-Kahf,26,0.428,0.125,0.693,0.183,indeed those who have believed and done righteous deed indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deed
Al-Kahf,46,0.9287,0.0,0.718,0.282,those will have garden of perpetual residence beneath them river will flow they will be adorned therein with bracelet of gold and will wear green garment of fine silk and brocade reclining therein on adorned couch excellent is the reward and good is the resting place
Al-Kahf,33,0.25,0.0,0.941,0.059,and present to them an example of two men we granted to one of them two garden of grapevine and we bordered them with palm tree and placed between them field of crop
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,each of the two garden produced it fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything and we caused to gush forth within them river
Al-Kahf,28,0.7184,0.0,0.781,0.219,and he had fruit so he said to his companion while he wa conversing with him am greater than you in wealth and mightier in number of men
Al-Kahf,21,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,and he entered his garden while he wa unjust to himself he said do not think that this will perish ever
Al-Kahf,26,0.7003,0.0,0.799,0.201,and do not think the hour will occur and even if should be brought back to my lord will surely find better than this a return
Al-Kahf,32,-0.0258,0.063,0.876,0.06,his companion said to him while he wa conversing with him have you disbelieved in he who created you from dust and then from sperm drop and then proportioned you a man
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but a for me he is allah my lord and do not associate with my lord anyone
Al-Kahf,34,0.5267,0.057,0.799,0.144,and why did you when you entered your garden not say what allah willed ha occurred there is no power except in allah although you see me le than you in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,30,0.4404,0.0,0.909,0.091,it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and will send upon it calamity from the sky and it will become smooth dusty ground
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or it water will become sunken into the earth so you would never be able to seek it
Al-Kahf,42,-0.4215,0.169,0.717,0.114,and his fruit were encompassed by ruin so he began to turn his hand about in dismay over what he had spent on it while it had collapsed upon it trellis and said oh wish had not associated with my lord anyone
Al-Kahf,18,-0.296,0.115,0.885,0.0,and there wa for him no company to aid him other than allah nor could he defend himself
Al-Kahf,18,0.9403,0.0,0.453,0.547,there the authority is completely for allah the truth he is best in reward and best in outcome
Al-Kahf,52,0.8176,0.0,0.852,0.148,and present to them the example of the life of this world it being like rain which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and then it becomes dry remnant scattered by the wind and allah is ever over all thing perfect in ability
Al-Kahf,27,0.9788,0.0,0.44,0.56,wealth and child are but adornment of the worldly life but the enduring good deed are better to your lord for reward and better for one hope
Al-Kahf,30,0.2612,0.044,0.848,0.108,and warn of the day when we will remove the mountain and you will see the earth prominent and we will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone
Al-Kahf,40,0.296,0.0,0.918,0.082,and they will be presented before your lord in row and he will say you have certainly come to u just a we created you the first time but you claimed that we would never make for you an appointment
Al-Kahf,62,-0.945,0.248,0.72,0.032,and the record of deed will be placed open and you will see the criminal fearful of that within it and they will say oh woe to u what is this book that leaf nothing small or great except that it ha enumerated it and they will find what they did present before them and your lord doe injustice to no one
Al-Kahf,58,-0.5423,0.06,0.94,0.0,and mention when we said to the angel prostrate to adam and they prostrated except for iblees he wa of the jinni and departed from the command of his lord then will you take him and his descendant a ally other than me while they are enemy to you wretched it is for the wrongdoer a an exchange
Al-Kahf,29,0.7579,0.0,0.769,0.231,did not make them witness to the creation of the heaven and the earth or to the creation of themselves and would not have taken the misguiders a assistant
Al-Kahf,36,-0.7391,0.155,0.845,0.0,and warn of the day when he will say call my partner whom you claimed and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and we will put between them valley of destruction
Al-Kahf,26,-0.5719,0.188,0.744,0.068,and the criminal will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein and they will not find from it way elsewhere
Al-Kahf,28,0.0644,0.106,0.75,0.144,and we have certainly diversified in this qur an for the people from every kind of example but man ha ever been most of anything prone to dispute
Al-Kahf,42,-0.4956,0.136,0.819,0.045,and nothing ha prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that there must befall them the accustomed precedent of the former people or that the punishment should come directly before them
Al-Kahf,43,-0.5859,0.195,0.703,0.102,and we send not the messenger except a bringers of good tidings and warner and those who disbelieve dispute by using falsehood to attempt to invalidate thereby the truth and have taken my verse and that of which they are warned in ridicule
Al-Kahf,60,0.5998,0.035,0.87,0.095,and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verse of his lord but turn away from them and forgets what his hand have put forth indeed we have placed over their heart covering lest they understand it and in their ear deafness and if you invite them to guidance they will never be guided then ever
Al-Kahf,43,-0.4438,0.18,0.715,0.104,and your lord is the forgiving full of mercy if he were to impose blame upon them for what they earned he would have hastened for them the punishment rather for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape
Al-Kahf,18,-0.8689,0.395,0.605,0.0,and those city we destroyed them when they wronged and we made for their destruction an appointed time

Al-Kahf,22,0.1531,0.0,0.929,0.071,but when they reached the junction between them they forgot their fish and it took it course into the sea slipping away
Al-Kahf,27,-0.4215,0.17,0.752,0.078,so when they had passed beyond it moses said to his boy bring u our morning meal we have certainly suffered in this our journey much fatigue
Al-Kahf,37,0.1695,0.0,0.956,0.044,he said did you see when we retired to the rock indeed forgot there the fish and none made me forget it except satan that should mention it and it took it course into the sea amazingly
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said that is what we were seeking so they returned following their footprint
Al-Kahf,24,0.5574,0.0,0.813,0.187,and they found servant from among our servant to whom we had given mercy from u and had taught him from u certain knowledge
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said to him may follow you on the condition that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said indeed with me you will never be able to have patience
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge

Al-Kahf,32,-0.9201,0.308,0.638,0.055,so they set out until when they met boy al khidh killed him moses said have you killed pure soul for other than having killed soul you have certainly done deplorable thing
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,al khidh said did not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience
Al-Kahf,24,0.0772,0.0,0.944,0.056,moses said if should ask you about anything after this then do not keep me a companion you have obtained from me an excuse
Al-Kahf,51,-0.558,0.121,0.819,0.06,so they set out until when they came to the people of town they asked it people for food but they refused to offer them hospitality and they found therein wall about to collapse so al khidh restored it moses said if you wished you could have taken for it payment
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,al khidh said this is parting between me and you will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
Al-Kahf,32,-0.3818,0.155,0.763,0.082,a for the ship it belonged to poor people working at sea so intended to cause defect in it a there wa after them king who seized every good ship by force
Al-Kahf,21,-0.4939,0.144,0.856,0.0,and a for the boy his parent were believer and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief
Al-Kahf,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,so we intended that their lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy
Al-Kahf,66,0.7184,0.0,0.882,0.118,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the city and there wa beneath it treasure for them and their father had been righteous so your lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure a mercy from your lord and did it not of my own accord that is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you muhammad about dhul qarnayn say will recite to you about him report
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we established him upon the earth and we gave him to everything way
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he followed way
Al-Kahf,42,0.1779,0.073,0.796,0.131,until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it a if setting in spring of dark mud and he found near it people allah said dhul qarnayn either you punish them or else adopt among them way of goodness
Al-Kahf,27,-0.9451,0.435,0.565,0.0,he said a for one who wrong we will punish him then he will be returned to his lord and he will punish him with terrible punishment
Al-Kahf,26,0.9442,0.0,0.609,0.391,but a for one who belief and doe righteousness he will have reward of paradise and we will speak to him from our command with ease
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed way
Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on people for whom we had not made against it any shield
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus and we had encompassed all that he had in knowledge
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed way
Al-Kahf,19,0.1027,0.0,0.928,0.072,until when he reached pas between two mountain he found beside them people who could hardly understand his speech
Al-Kahf,31,0.5574,0.045,0.833,0.122,they said dhul qarnayn indeed gog and magog are great corrupters in the land so may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between u and them barrier
Al-Kahf,28,0.7876,0.0,0.759,0.241,he said that in which my lord ha established me is better than what you offer but assist me with strength will make between you and them dam
Al-Kahf,40,0.0258,0.056,0.886,0.058,bring me sheet of iron until when he had leveled them between the two mountain wall he said blow with bellow until when he had made it like fire he said bring me that may pour over it molten copper

Ta-Ha,22,0.25,0.0,0.913,0.087,from the earth we created you and into it we will return you and from it we will extract you another time
Ta-Ha,15,-0.714,0.327,0.59,0.084,and we certainly showed pharaoh our sign all of them but he denied and refused
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said have you come to u to drive u out of our land with your magic moses
Ta-Ha,31,0.8047,0.0,0.766,0.234,then we will surely bring you magic like it so make between u and you an appointment which we will not fail to keep and neither will you in place assigned
Ta-Ha,18,0.4939,0.0,0.842,0.158,moses said your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid morning
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so pharaoh went away put together his plan and then came to moses
Ta-Ha,32,-0.7845,0.234,0.705,0.06,moses said to the magician summoned by pharaoh woe to you do not invent lie against allah or he will exterminate you with punishment and he ha failed who invents such falsehood
Ta-Ha,13,-0.3976,0.182,0.818,0.0,so they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation
Ta-Ha,27,0.0772,0.0,0.952,0.048,they said indeed these are two magician who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way
Ta-Ha,18,0.796,0.0,0.65,0.35,so resolve upon your plan and then come forward in line and he ha succeeded today who overcomes
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses either you throw or we will be the first to throw
Ta-Ha,23,0.3612,0.0,0.898,0.102,he said rather you throw and suddenly their rope and staff seemed to him from their magic that they were moving like snake
Ta-Ha,8,-0.4767,0.307,0.693,0.0,and he sensed within himself apprehension did moses
Ta-Ha,11,0.0772,0.204,0.573,0.223,allah said fear not indeed it is you who are superior
Ta-Ha,35,-0.3903,0.122,0.824,0.054,and throw what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have crafted what they have crafted is but the trick of magician and the magician will not succeed wherever he is
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the magician fell down in prostration they said we have believed in the lord of aaron and moses
Ta-Ha,59,0.7322,0.116,0.684,0.2,pharaoh said you believed him before gave you permission indeed he is your leader who ha taught you magic so will surely cut off your hand and your foot on opposite side and will crucify you on the trunk of palm tree and you will surely know which of u is more severe in giving punishment and more enduring
Ta-Ha,37,0.7184,0.0,0.821,0.179,they said never will we prefer you over what ha come to u of clear proof and over he who created u so decree whatever you are to decree you can only decree for this worldly life
Ta-Ha,30,0.1531,0.107,0.71,0.183,indeed we have believed in our lord that he may forgive u our sin and what you compelled u to do of magic and allah is better and more enduring
Ta-Ha,20,-0.7054,0.295,0.589,0.116,indeed whoever come to his lord a criminal indeed for him is hell he will neither die therein nor live
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but whoever come to him a believer having done righteous deed for those will be the highest degree in position
Ta-Ha,22,0.5719,0.0,0.85,0.15,garden of perpetual residence beneath which river flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of one who purifies himself
Ta-Ha,34,0.6517,0.039,0.809,0.152,and we had inspired to moses travel by night with my servant and strike for them dry path through the sea you will not fear being overtaken by pharaoh nor be afraid of drowning
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so pharaoh pursued them with his soldier and there covered them from the sea that which covered them
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them
Ta-Ha,32,-0.5423,0.101,0.899,0.0,child of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount and we sent down to you manna and quail

Ta-Ha,19,0.5499,0.0,0.835,0.165,but indeed am the perpetual forgiver of whoever repents and belief and doe righteousness and then continues in guidance
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah said and what made you hasten from your people moses
Ta-Ha,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,he said they are close upon my track and hastened to you my lord that you be pleased
Ta-Ha,19,0.4767,0.0,0.853,0.147,allah said but indeed we have tried your people after you departed and the samiri ha led them astray
Ta-Ha,53,-0.6688,0.181,0.707,0.112,so moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said my people did your lord not make you good promise then wa the time of it fulfillment too long for you or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you so you broke your promise of obedience to me
Ta-Ha,41,-0.8142,0.182,0.818,0.0,they said we did not break our promise to you by our will but we were made to carry burden from the ornament of the people of pharaoh so we threw them into the fire and thus did the samiri throw
Ta-Ha,28,0.2144,0.043,0.852,0.106,and he extracted for them the statue of calf which had lowing sound and they said this is your god and the god of moses but he forgot
Ta-Ha,25,-0.128,0.119,0.78,0.102,did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not posse for them any harm or benefit
Ta-Ha,35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and aaron had already told them before the return of moses my people you are only being tested by it and indeed your lord is the most merciful so follow me and obey my order
Ta-Ha,16,-0.3089,0.139,0.861,0.0,they said we will never cease being devoted to the calf until moses return to u
Ta-Ha,12,0.0258,0.0,0.909,0.091,moses said aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,from following me then have you disobeyed my order
Ta-Ha,40,-0.5417,0.106,0.894,0.0,aaron said son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or by my head indeed feared that you would say you caused division among the child of israel and you did not observe or await my word
Ta-Ha,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said and what is your case samiri
Ta-Ha,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said saw what they did not see so took handful of dust from the track of the messenger and threw it and thus did my soul entice me
Ta-Ha,56,0.81,0.035,0.8,0.165,moses said then go and indeed it is decreed for you in this life to say no contact and indeed you have an appointment in the hereafter you will not fail to keep and look at your god to which you remained devoted we will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with blast
Ta-Ha,19,0.3182,0.097,0.705,0.198,your god is only allah except for whom there is no deity he ha encompassed all thing in knowledge
Ta-Ha,24,0.5859,0.0,0.814,0.186,thus muhammad we relate to you from the news of what ha preceded and we have certainly given you from u the qur an
Ta-Ha,16,-0.4404,0.162,0.838,0.0,whoever turn away from it then indeed he will bear on the day of resurrection burden

Ta-Ha,17,-0.5267,0.175,0.825,0.0,the day the horn will be blown and we will gather the criminal that day blue eyed
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will murmur among themselves you remained not but ten day in the world
Ta-Ha,23,0.3818,0.0,0.894,0.106,we are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say you remained not but one day
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you about the mountain so say my lord will blow them away with blast
Ta-Ha,8,-0.0516,0.146,0.854,0.0,and he will leave the earth level plain
Ta-Ha,9,0.4585,0.0,0.727,0.273,you will not see therein depression or an elevation
Ta-Ha,33,-0.296,0.064,0.936,0.0,that day everyone will follow the call of the caller with no deviation therefrom and all voice will be stilled before the most merciful so you will not hear except whisper of footstep
Ta-Ha,23,0.8051,0.072,0.587,0.341,that day no intercession will benefit except that of one to whom the most merciful ha given permission and ha accepted his word
Ta-Ha,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah know what is presently before them and what will be after them but they do not encompass it in knowledge
Ta-Ha,22,-0.7906,0.259,0.741,0.0,and all face will be humbled before the ever living the sustainer of existence and he will have failed who carry injustice
Ta-Ha,18,0.8869,0.0,0.59,0.41,but he who doe of righteous deed while he is believer he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation
Ta-Ha,30,-0.802,0.24,0.76,0.0,and thus we have sent it down a an arabic qur an and have diversified therein the warning that perhaps they will avoid sin or it would cause them remembrance
Ta-Ha,36,0.5574,0.0,0.881,0.119,so high above all is allah the sovereign the truth and muhammad do not hasten with recitation of the qur an before it revelation is completed to you and say my lord increase me in knowledge
Ta-Ha,19,-0.3043,0.134,0.789,0.077,and we had already taken promise from adam before but he forgot and we found not in him determination
Ta-Ha,18,-0.296,0.115,0.885,0.0,and mention when we said to the angel prostrate to adam and they prostrated except iblees he refused
Ta-Ha,27,-0.4703,0.205,0.677,0.118,so we said adam indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife then let him not remove you from paradise so you would suffer
Ta-Ha,14,0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,indeed it is promised for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun
Ta-Ha,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then satan whispered to him he said adam shall direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate
Ta-Ha,35,0.6369,0.0,0.89,0.11,and adam and his wife ate of it and their private part became apparent to them and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaf of paradise and adam disobeyed his lord and erred
Ta-Ha,14,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,then his lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided him
Ta-Ha,40,0.5499,0.074,0.778,0.148,allah said descend from paradise all your descendant being enemy to one another and if there should come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereafter
Ta-Ha,24,-0.7184,0.214,0.786,0.0,and whoever turn away from my remembrance indeed he will have depressed life and we will gather him on the day of resurrection blind
Ta-Ha,15,-0.4019,0.162,0.838,0.0,he will say my lord why have you raised me blind while wa once seeing
Ta-Ha,22,-0.2263,0.083,0.917,0.0,allah will say thus did our sign come to you and you forgot them and thus will you this day be forgotten
Ta-Ha,30,-0.7264,0.179,0.821,0.0,and thus do we recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the sign of his lord and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring
Ta-Ha,30,0.0557,0.15,0.667,0.183,then ha it not become clear to them how many generation we destroyed before them a they walk among their dwelling indeed in that are sign for those of intelligence
Ta-Ha,25,-0.4939,0.118,0.882,0.0,and if not for word that preceded from your lord punishment would have been an obligation due immediately and if not for specified term decreed
Ta-Ha,45,0.7506,0.0,0.87,0.13,so be patient over what they say and exalt allah with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before it setting and during period of the night exalt him and at the end of the day that you may be satisfied
Ta-Ha,43,0.908,0.024,0.751,0.224,and do not extend your eye toward that by which we have given enjoyment to some category of them it being but the splendor of worldly life by which we test them and the provision of your lord is better and more enduring
Ta-Ha,31,0.7351,0.0,0.824,0.176,and enjoin prayer upon your family and people and be steadfast therein we ask you not for provision we provide for you and the best outcome is for those of righteousness
Ta-Ha,27,0.34,0.0,0.912,0.088,and they say why doe he not bring u sign from his lord ha there not come to them evidence of what wa in the former scripture
Ta-Ha,37,-0.8957,0.269,0.731,0.0,and if we had destroyed them with punishment before him they would have said our lord why did you not send to u messenger so we could have followed your verse before we were humiliated and disgraced
Ta-Ha,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,say each of u is waiting so wait for you will know who are the companion of the sound path and who is guided
Al-Anbiya,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,the time of their account ha approached for the people while they are in heedlessness turning away
Al-Anbiya,20,0.0516,0.097,0.796,0.106,no mention come to them anew from their lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
Al-Anbiya,33,-0.4588,0.145,0.789,0.066,with their heart distracted and those who do wrong conceal their private conversation saying is this prophet except human being like you so would you approach magic while you are aware of it
Al-Anbiya,21,0.5106,0.0,0.858,0.142,the prophet said my lord know whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth and he is the hearing the knowing
Al-Anbiya,35,0.8957,0.0,0.735,0.265,but they say the revelation is but mixture of false dream rather he ha invented it rather he is poet so let him bring u sign just a the previous messenger were sent with miracle
Al-Anbiya,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,not single city which we destroyed believed before them so will they believe

Al-Anbiya,17,-0.1877,0.098,0.902,0.0,and we did not make the prophet form not eating food nor were they immortal on earth
Al-Anbiya,19,0.5719,0.123,0.575,0.303,then we fulfilled for them the promise and we saved them and whom we willed and destroyed the transgressor
Al-Anbiya,18,0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,we have certainly sent down to you book in which is your mention then will you not reason
Al-Anbiya,16,-0.7506,0.314,0.686,0.0,and how many city which wa unjust have we shattered and produced after it another people
Al-Anbiya,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,and when it inhabitant perceived our punishment at once they fled from it
Al-Anbiya,23,-0.1531,0.068,0.932,0.0,some angel said do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your home perhaps you will be questioned

Al-Anbiya,19,0.0258,0.115,0.766,0.12,and that declaration of theirs did not cease until we made them a harvest mowed down extinguished like fire
Al-Anbiya,15,-0.2769,0.239,0.634,0.127,and we did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play

Al-Anbiya,25,-0.7184,0.231,0.696,0.073,rather we dash the truth upon falsehood and it destroys it and thereupon it departs and for you is destruction from that which you describe
Al-Anbiya,27,0.8021,0.033,0.711,0.256,to him belongs whoever is in the heaven and the earth and those near him are not prevented by arrogance from his worship nor do they tire

Al-Anbiya,14,-0.4939,0.234,0.652,0.114,or have men taken for themselves god from the earth who resurrect the dead
Al-Anbiya,29,0.3182,0.09,0.754,0.157,had there been within the heaven and earth god besides allah they both would have been ruined so exalted is allah lord of the throne above what they describe

Al-Anbiya,24,-0.5423,0.16,0.767,0.073,and whoever of them should say indeed am god besides him that one we would recompense with hell thus do we recompense the wrongdoer
Al-Anbiya,31,0.5106,0.0,0.901,0.099,have those who disbelieved not considered that the heaven and the earth were joined entity and we separated them and made from water every living thing then will they not believe
Al-Anbiya,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we placed within the earth firmly set mountain lest it should shift with them and we made therein mountain pass a road that they might be guided
Al-Anbiya,15,0.2382,0.0,0.878,0.122,and we made the sky protected ceiling but they from it sign are turning away
Al-Anbiya,25,0.7184,0.0,0.793,0.207,and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon all heavenly body in an orbit are swimming
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.741,0.248,0.752,0.0,and we did not grant to any man before you eternity on earth so if you die would they be eternal

Al-Anbiya,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,rather it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be reprieved
Al-Anbiya,20,-0.8271,0.339,0.661,0.0,and already were messenger ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
Al-Anbiya,25,0.2023,0.0,0.93,0.07,say who can protect you at night or by day from the most merciful but they are from the remembrance of their lord turning away
Al-Anbiya,25,0.7717,0.0,0.722,0.278,or do they have god to defend them other than u they are unable even to help themselves nor can they be protected from u
Al-Anbiya,44,0.5927,0.0,0.918,0.082,but on the contrary we have provided good thing for these disbeliever and their father until life wa prolonged for them then do they not see that we set upon the land reducing it from it border so it is they who will overcome

Al-Muminun,48,0.2228,0.051,0.881,0.068,but the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said this is not but man like yourselves who wish to take precedence over you and if allah had willed to send messenger he would have sent down angel we have not heard of this among our forefather
Al-Muminun,14,-0.5927,0.228,0.772,0.0,he is not but man possessed with madness so wait concerning him for time
Al-Muminun,11,-0.0516,0.199,0.616,0.185,noah said my lord support me because they have denied me
Al-Muminun,61,-0.3008,0.14,0.736,0.124,so we inspired to him construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and when our command come and the oven overflow put into the ship from each creature two mate and your family except those for whom the decree of destruction ha proceeded and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
Al-Muminun,25,0.8316,0.0,0.705,0.295,and when you have boarded the ship you and those with you then say praise to allah who ha saved u from the wrongdoing people

Al-Muminun,47,-0.5596,0.093,0.907,0.0,and the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter while we had given them luxury in the worldly life said this is not but man like yourselves he eats of that from which you eat and drink of what you drink
Al-Muminun,14,-0.2263,0.19,0.67,0.14,and if you should obey man like yourselves indeed you would then be loser

Al-Muminun,20,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,so the shriek seized them in truth and we made them a plant stubble then away with the wrongdoing people
Al-Muminun,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we produced after them other generation
Al-Muminun,13,-0.296,0.155,0.845,0.0,no nation will precede it time of termination nor will they remain thereafter
Al-Muminun,40,-0.7003,0.145,0.815,0.04,then we sent our messenger in succession every time there came to nation it messenger they denied him so we made them follow one another to destruction and we made them narration so away with people who do not believe
Al-Muminun,14,0.4404,0.0,0.755,0.245,then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our sign and clear authority
Al-Muminun,13,-0.6486,0.264,0.736,0.0,to pharaoh and his establishment but they were arrogant and were haughty people
Al-Muminun,17,0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,they said should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for u in servitude
Al-Muminun,9,-0.749,0.477,0.523,0.0,so they denied them and were of those destroyed
Al-Muminun,13,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,and we certainly gave moses the scripture that perhaps they would be guided
Al-Muminun,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made the son of mary and his mother sign and sheltered them within high ground having level area and flowing water
Al-Muminun,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,allah said messenger eat from the good food and work righteousness indeed of what you do am knowing

Al-Muminun,17,0.8519,0.0,0.644,0.356,but the people divided their religion among them into sect each faction in what it ha rejoicing
Al-Muminun,8,-0.4005,0.381,0.619,0.0,so leave them in their confusion for time
Al-Muminun,13,0.5994,0.0,0.692,0.308,do they think that what we extend to them of wealth and child
Al-Muminun,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,is because we hasten for them good thing rather they do not perceive
Al-Muminun,10,-0.4939,0.262,0.738,0.0,indeed they who are apprehensive from fear of their lord
Al-Muminun,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they who believe in the sign of their lord
Al-Muminun,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they who do not associate anything with their lord
Al-Muminun,20,-0.4939,0.144,0.856,0.0,and they who give what they give while their heart are fearful because they will be returning to their lord
Al-Muminun,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,it is those who hasten to good deed and they outstrip others therein
Al-Muminun,26,0.3624,0.076,0.761,0.163,and we charge no soul except with that within it capacity and with u is record which speaks with truth and they will not be wronged
Al-Muminun,20,-0.872,0.331,0.669,0.0,but their heart are covered with confusion over this and they have evil deed besides disbelief which they are doing
Al-Muminun,18,-0.5574,0.263,0.625,0.113,until when we seize their affluent one with punishment at once they are cry to allah for help
Al-Muminun,13,0.3724,0.0,0.812,0.188,do not cry out today indeed by u you will not be helped
Al-Muminun,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my verse had already been recited to you but you were turning back on your heel
Al-Muminun,9,-0.8316,0.527,0.473,0.0,in arrogance regarding it conversing by night speaking evil
Al-Muminun,23,0.34,0.0,0.902,0.098,then have they not reflected over the qur an or ha there come to them that which had not come to their forefather
Al-Muminun,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or did they not know their messenger so they are toward him
Al-Muminun,23,0.3919,0.073,0.753,0.173,or do they say in him is madness rather he brought them the truth but most of them to the truth are averse
Al-Muminun,37,0.5023,0.091,0.746,0.162,but if the truth had followed their inclination the heaven and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined rather we have brought them their message but they from their message are turning away
Al-Muminun,23,0.962,0.0,0.546,0.454,or do you muhammad ask them for payment but the reward of your lord is best and he is the best of provider
Al-Muminun,8,0.3612,0.0,0.632,0.368,and indeed you invite them to straight path
Al-Muminun,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the path
Al-Muminun,23,0.3612,0.0,0.898,0.102,and even if we gave them mercy and removed what wa upon them of affliction they would persist in their transgression wandering blindly
Al-Muminun,26,-0.4118,0.14,0.86,0.0,and we had gripped them with suffering a warning but they did not yield to their lord nor did they humbly supplicate and will continue thus
Al-Muminun,18,-0.7964,0.351,0.649,0.0,until when we have opened before them door of severe punishment immediately they will be therein in despair
Al-Muminun,17,0.577,0.0,0.76,0.24,and it is he who produced for you hearing and vision and heart little are you grateful
Al-Muminun,18,0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,and it is he who ha multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered

An-Naml,13,0.3818,0.0,0.822,0.178,ta seen these are the verse of the qur an and clear book
An-Naml,8,0.4404,0.0,0.674,0.326,a guidance and good tidings for the believer
An-Naml,15,0.5994,0.0,0.726,0.274,who establish prayer and give zakah and of the hereafter they are certain in faith
An-Naml,22,0.5267,0.0,0.861,0.139,indeed for those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made pleasing to them their deed so they wander blindly
An-Naml,22,-0.7579,0.325,0.547,0.128,those are the one for whom there will be the worst of punishment and in the hereafter they are the greatest loser
An-Naml,13,0.4767,0.0,0.795,0.205,and indeed muhammad you receive the qur an from one wise and knowing
An-Naml,28,-0.128,0.079,0.858,0.063,mention when moses said to his family indeed have perceived fire will bring you from there information or will bring you burning torch that you may warm yourselves
An-Naml,29,0.5023,0.087,0.762,0.151,but when he came to it he wa called blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it and exalted is allah lord of the world
An-Naml,11,0.4767,0.0,0.763,0.237,moses indeed it is allah the exalted in might the wise
An-Naml,41,-0.8625,0.185,0.815,0.0,and he wa told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing a if it were snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said moses fear not indeed in my presence the messenger do not fear
An-Naml,14,-0.4019,0.322,0.429,0.249,otherwise he who wrong then substitute good after evil indeed am forgiving and merciful
An-Naml,41,0.4939,0.0,0.926,0.074,and put your hand into the opening of your garment at the breast it will come out white without disease these are among the nine sign you will take to pharaoh and his people indeed they have been people defiantly disobedient
An-Naml,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but when there came to them our visible sign they said this is obvious magic
An-Naml,25,-0.6486,0.221,0.694,0.085,and they rejected them while their inner self were convinced thereof out of injustice and haughtiness so see how wa the end of the corrupters
An-Naml,28,0.8807,0.0,0.673,0.327,and we had certainly given to david and solomon knowledge and they said praise is due to allah who ha favored u over many of his believing servant
An-Naml,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and solomon inherited david he said people we have been taught the language of bird and we have been given from all thing indeed this is evident bounty
An-Naml,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and gathered for solomon were his soldier of the jinni and men and bird and they were marching in row
An-Naml,31,0.3468,0.0,0.894,0.106,until when they came upon the valley of the ant an ant said ant enter your dwelling that you not be crushed by solomon and his soldier while they perceive not
An-Naml,50,0.9417,0.0,0.723,0.277,so solomon smiled amused at her speech and said my lord enable me to be grateful for your favor which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parent and to do righteousness of which you approve and admit me by your mercy into the rank of your righteous servant
An-Naml,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he took attendance of the bird and said why do not see the hoopoe or is he among the absent
An-Naml,16,-0.5719,0.358,0.428,0.214,will surely punish him with severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization
An-Naml,28,0.3919,0.0,0.911,0.089,but the hoopoe stayed not long and said have encompassed in knowledge that which you have not encompassed and have come to you from sheba with certain news
An-Naml,19,0.836,0.0,0.643,0.357,indeed found there woman ruling them and she ha been given of all thing and she ha great throne
An-Naml,32,0.6705,0.036,0.803,0.161,found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of allah and satan ha made their deed pleasing to them and averted them from his way so they are not guided
An-Naml,29,0.5106,0.0,0.895,0.105,and so they do not prostrate to allah who brings forth what is hidden within the heaven and the earth and know what you conceal and what you declare
An-Naml,12,0.4404,0.135,0.613,0.252,allah there is no deity except him lord of the great throne
An-Naml,14,-0.0772,0.18,0.656,0.164,solomon said we will see whether you were truthful or were of the liar
An-Naml,20,-0.0516,0.059,0.941,0.0,take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then leave them and see what answer they will return
An-Naml,12,0.6597,0.0,0.649,0.351,she said eminent one indeed to me ha been delivered noble letter
An-Naml,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed it is from solomon and indeed it read in the name of allah the entirely merciful the especially merciful
An-Naml,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,be not haughty with me but come to me in submission a muslim
An-Naml,18,-0.0191,0.059,0.941,0.0,she said eminent one advise me in my affair would not decide matter until you witness for me
An-Naml,23,0.5647,0.0,0.819,0.181,they said we are men of strength and of great military might but the command is yours so see what you will command
An-Naml,24,0.0,0.128,0.743,0.128,she said indeed king when they enter city they ruin it and render the honored of it people humbled and thus do they do
An-Naml,16,0.5927,0.0,0.796,0.204,but indeed will send to them gift and see with what reply the messenger will return
An-Naml,37,0.9631,0.0,0.61,0.39,so when they came to solomon he said do you provide me with wealth but what allah ha given me is better than what he ha given you rather it is you who rejoice in your gift
An-Naml,33,-0.6124,0.225,0.642,0.133,return to them for we will surely come to them with soldier that they will be powerless to encounter and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation and they will be debased
An-Naml,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,solomon said assembly of jinni which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission
An-Naml,27,0.8658,0.0,0.712,0.288,powerful one from among the jinni said will bring it to you before you rise from your place and indeed am for this task strong and trustworthy
An-Naml,73,0.9393,0.066,0.699,0.236,said one who had knowledge from the scripture will bring it to you before your glance return to you and when solomon saw it placed before him he said this is from the favor of my lord to test me whether will be grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful his gratitude is only for the benefit of himself and whoever is ungrateful then indeed my lord is free of need and generous
An-Naml,26,0.0772,0.071,0.848,0.081,he said disguise for her her throne we will see whether she will be guided to truth or will be of those who is not guided
An-Naml,41,0.3612,0.0,0.94,0.06,so when she arrived it wa said to her is your throne like this she said it is a though it wa it solomon said and we were given knowledge before her and we have been muslim in submission to allah
An-Naml,22,0.3182,0.054,0.837,0.109,and that which she wa worshipping other than allah had averted her from submission to him indeed she wa from disbelieving people
An-Naml,56,-0.5927,0.065,0.935,0.0,she wa told enter the palace but when she saw it she thought it wa body of water and uncovered her shin to wade through he said indeed it is palace whose floor is made smooth with glass she said my lord indeed have wronged myself and submit with solomon to allah lord of the world
An-Naml,21,0.5574,0.1,0.63,0.27,and we had certainly sent to thamud their brother salih saying worship allah and at once they were two party conflicting
An-Naml,26,-0.4614,0.242,0.603,0.155,he said my people why are you impatient for evil instead of good why do you not seek forgiveness of allah that you may receive mercy
An-Naml,25,-0.5423,0.127,0.873,0.0,they said we consider you bad omen you and those with you he said your omen is with allah rather you are people being tested
An-Naml,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and there were in the city nine family head causing corruption in the land and not amending it affair
An-Naml,39,0.0767,0.101,0.771,0.128,they said take mutual oath by allah that we will kill him by night he and his family then we will say to his executor we did not witness the destruction of his family and indeed we are truthful
An-Naml,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they planned plan and we planned plan while they perceived not
An-Naml,17,-0.4939,0.167,0.833,0.0,then look how wa the outcome of their plan that we destroyed them and their people all
An-Naml,22,-0.4767,0.129,0.871,0.0,so those are their house desolate because of the wrong they had done indeed in that is sign for people who know
An-Naml,11,-0.1027,0.213,0.6,0.187,and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
An-Naml,17,0.1531,0.085,0.798,0.117,and mention lot when he said to his people do you commit immorality while you are seeing
An-Naml,16,0.0258,0.135,0.725,0.14,do you indeed approach men with desire instead of woman rather you are people behaving ignorantly
An-Naml,28,-0.5927,0.125,0.875,0.0,but the answer of his people wa not except that they said expel the family of lot from your city indeed they are people who keep themselves pure
An-Naml,21,0.4728,0.0,0.867,0.133,so we saved him and his family except for his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
An-Naml,18,-0.7579,0.289,0.711,0.0,and we rained upon them rain of stone and evil wa the rain of those who were warned
An-Naml,24,0.9081,0.0,0.617,0.383,say muhammad praise be to allah and peace upon his servant whom he ha chosen is allah better or what they associate with him
An-Naml,55,0.4303,0.084,0.801,0.114,more precisely is he not best who created the heaven and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky causing to grow thereby garden of joyful beauty which you could not otherwise have grown the tree thereof is there deity with allah no but they are people who ascribe equal to him
An-Naml,42,-0.3472,0.113,0.851,0.036,is he not best who made the earth stable ground and placed within it river and made for it firmly set mountain and placed between the two sea barrier is there deity with allah no but most of them do not know

An-Naml,22,-0.4023,0.114,0.886,0.0,say none in the heaven and earth know the unseen except allah and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
An-Naml,21,-0.8074,0.316,0.684,0.0,rather their knowledge is arrested concerning the hereafter rather they are in doubt about it rather they are concerning it blind
An-Naml,24,-0.0258,0.091,0.823,0.086,and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust a well a our forefather will we indeed be brought out of the graf
An-Naml,19,0.1901,0.0,0.911,0.089,we have been promised this we and our forefather before this is not but legend of the former people
An-Naml,15,-0.5267,0.195,0.805,0.0,say muhammad travel through the land and observe how wa the end of the criminal
An-Naml,13,-0.7184,0.353,0.647,0.0,and grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire
An-Naml,15,0.6833,0.0,0.698,0.302,and they say when is the fulfillment of this promise if you should be truthful
An-Naml,15,-0.296,0.136,0.864,0.0,say perhaps it is close behind you some of that for which you are impatient
An-Naml,19,-0.5504,0.165,0.835,0.0,and indeed your lord is full of bounty for the people but most of them do not show gratitude
An-Naml,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed your lord know what their breast conceal and what they declare
An-Naml,18,0.7096,0.0,0.731,0.269,and there is nothing concealed within the heaven and the earth except that it is in clear register
An-Naml,17,-0.3818,0.14,0.86,0.0,indeed this qur an relates to the child of israel most of that over which they disagree
An-Naml,10,0.3612,0.0,0.783,0.217,and indeed it is guidance and mercy for the believer
An-Naml,20,0.4767,0.0,0.86,0.14,indeed your lord will judge between them by his wise judgement and he is the exalted in might the knowing

An-Naml,31,-0.4847,0.125,0.875,0.0,and when the word befalls them we will bring forth for them creature from the earth speaking to them saying that the people were of our verse not certain in faith
An-Naml,26,-0.4215,0.137,0.863,0.0,and warn of the day when we will gather from every nation company of those who deny our sign and they will be driven in row
An-Naml,32,-0.34,0.072,0.928,0.0,until when they arrive at the place of judgement he will say did you deny my sign while you encompassed them not in knowledge or what wa it that you were doing
An-Naml,19,-0.4767,0.147,0.853,0.0,and the decree will befall them for the wrong they did and they will not be able to speak

An-Naml,36,0.4939,0.039,0.864,0.097,and you see the mountain thinking them rigid while they will pas a the passing of cloud it is the work of allah who perfected all thing indeed he is acquainted with that which you do
An-Naml,23,0.6486,0.109,0.611,0.28,whoever come at judgement with good deed will have better than it and they from the terror of that day will be safe
An-Naml,30,-0.7783,0.195,0.805,0.0,and whoever come with an evil deed their face will be overturned into the fire and it will be said are you recompensed except for what you used to do
An-Naml,36,0.296,0.0,0.941,0.059,say muhammad have only been commanded to worship the lord of this city who made it sacred and to whom belongs all thing and am commanded to be of the muslim those who submit to allah

An-Naml,29,0.636,0.0,0.839,0.161,and say all praise is due to allah he will show you his sign and you will recognize them and your lord is not unaware of what you do
Al-Qasas,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ta seen meem
Al-Qasas,8,0.3818,0.0,0.729,0.271,these are the verse of the clear book
Al-Qasas,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,we recite to you from the news of moses and pharaoh in truth for people who believe
Al-Qasas,32,0.3818,0.0,0.923,0.077,indeed pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made it people into faction oppressing sector among them slaughtering their newborn son and keeping their female alive indeed he wa of the corrupters
Al-Qasas,22,-0.1027,0.12,0.775,0.105,and we wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leader and make them inheritor
Al-Qasas,23,-0.4939,0.127,0.873,0.0,and establish them in the land and show pharaoh and his minister haman and their soldier through them that which they had feared
Al-Qasas,44,-0.6931,0.161,0.748,0.091,and we inspired to the mother of moses suckle him but when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve indeed we will return him to you and will make him one of the messenger
Al-Qasas,35,-0.7717,0.169,0.831,0.0,and the family of pharaoh picked him up out of the river so that he would become to them an enemy and cause of grief indeed pharaoh and haman and their soldier were deliberate sinner
Al-Qasas,38,0.8732,0.0,0.745,0.255,and the wife of pharaoh said he will be comfort of the eye for me and for you do not kill him perhaps he may benefit u or we may adopt him a son and they perceived not
Al-Qasas,34,-0.1779,0.052,0.917,0.032,and the heart of moses mother became empty of all else she wa about to disclose the matter concerning him had we not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believer
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to his sister follow him so she watched him from distance while they perceived not
Al-Qasas,35,0.6249,0.0,0.84,0.16,and we had prevented from him all wet nurse before so she said shall direct you to household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him for his upbringing sincere
Al-Qasas,35,0.61,0.0,0.816,0.184,so we restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of allah is true but most of the people do not know
Al-Qasas,27,0.9118,0.0,0.646,0.354,and when he attained his full strength and wa mentally mature we bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge and thus do we reward the doer of good
Al-Qasas,68,-0.9627,0.264,0.704,0.032,and he entered the city at time of inattention by it people and found therein two men fighting one from his faction and one from among his enemy and the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy so moses struck him and unintentionally killed him moses said this is from the work of satan indeed he is manifest misleading enemy
Al-Qasas,22,0.5849,0.101,0.63,0.269,he said my lord indeed have wronged myself so forgive me and he forgave him indeed he is the forgiving the merciful
Al-Qasas,19,-0.1779,0.147,0.736,0.117,he said my lord for the favor you bestowed upon me will never be an assistant to the criminal
Al-Qasas,38,-0.4767,0.133,0.805,0.062,and he became inside the city fearful and anticipating exposure when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him once again moses said to him indeed you are an evident persistent deviator
Al-Qasas,48,-0.9274,0.246,0.709,0.045,and when he wanted to strike the one who wa an enemy to both of them he said moses do you intend to kill me a you killed someone yesterday you only want to be tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders
Al-Qasas,38,-0.5413,0.141,0.797,0.062,and man came from the farthest end of the city running he said moses indeed the eminent one are conferring over you intending to kill you so leave the city indeed am to you of the sincere advisor
Al-Qasas,18,-0.4767,0.257,0.612,0.131,so he left it fearful and anticipating apprehension he said my lord save me from the wrongdoing people
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he directed himself toward madyan he said perhaps my lord will guide me to the sound way
Al-Qasas,55,0.2732,0.0,0.963,0.037,and when he came to the well of madyan he found there crowd of people watering their flock and he found aside from them two woman driving back their flock he said what is your circumstance they said we do not water until the shepherd dispatch their flock and our father is an old man
Al-Qasas,31,0.4404,0.0,0.912,0.088,so he watered their flock for them then he went back to the shade and said my lord indeed am for whatever good you would send down to me in need
Al-Qasas,52,-0.0516,0.095,0.813,0.092,then one of the two woman came to him walking with shyness she said indeed my father invite you that he may reward you for having watered for u so when he came to him and related to him the story he said fear not you have escaped from the wrongdoing people
Al-Qasas,22,0.9022,0.0,0.631,0.369,one of the woman said my father hire him indeed the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy
Al-Qasas,55,0.705,0.05,0.806,0.144,he said indeed wish to wed you one of these my two daughter on the condition that you serve me for eight year but if you complete ten it will be a favor from you and do not wish to put you in difficulty you will find me if allah will from among the righteous
Al-Qasas,29,-0.7096,0.179,0.821,0.0,moses said that is established between me and you whichever of the two term complete there is no injustice to me and allah over what we say is witness
Al-Qasas,52,-0.6486,0.126,0.841,0.033,and when moses had completed the term and wa traveling with his family he perceived from the direction of the mount fire he said to his family stay here indeed have perceived fire perhaps will bring you from there some information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,30,0.7469,0.0,0.844,0.156,but when he came to it he wa called from the right side of the valley in blessed spot from the tree moses indeed am allah lord of the world
Al-Qasas,40,-0.296,0.097,0.833,0.07,and he wa told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing a if it wa snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said moses approach and fear not indeed you are of the secure

Al-Qasas,16,-0.9246,0.488,0.512,0.0,he said my lord indeed killed from among them someone and fear they will kill me
Al-Qasas,27,-0.4404,0.179,0.735,0.086,and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongue so send him with me a support verifying me indeed fear that they will deny me
Al-Qasas,37,0.6028,0.027,0.823,0.15,allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you it will be through our sign you and those who follow you will be the predominant
Al-Qasas,31,0.5267,0.0,0.895,0.105,but when moses came to them with our sign a clear evidence they said this is not except invented magic and we have not heard of this religion among our forefather
Al-Qasas,34,0.1461,0.069,0.819,0.111,and moses said my lord is more knowing than we or you of who ha come with guidance from him and to whom will be succession in the home indeed wrongdoer do not succeed
Al-Qasas,46,-0.3612,0.11,0.809,0.081,and pharaoh said eminent one have not known you to have god other than me then ignite for me haman fire upon the clay and make for me tower that may look at the god of moses and indeed do think he is among the liar
Al-Qasas,24,-0.4939,0.127,0.873,0.0,and he wa arrogant he and his soldier in the land without right and they thought that they would not be returned to u
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we took him and his soldier and threw them into the sea so see how wa the end of the wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,20,-0.0258,0.106,0.793,0.101,and we made them leader inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
Al-Qasas,22,-0.7351,0.237,0.763,0.0,and we caused to overtake them in this world curse and on the day of resurrection they will be of the despised
Al-Qasas,27,-0.1779,0.108,0.808,0.084,and we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generation a enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded
Al-Qasas,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and you muhammad were not on the western side of the mount when we revealed to moses the command and you were not among the witness to that
Al-Qasas,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we produced many generation after moses and prolonged wa their duration and you were not resident among the people of madyan reciting to them our verse but we were sender of this message
Al-Qasas,38,-0.0387,0.106,0.816,0.078,and you were not at the side of the mount when we called moses but were sent a mercy from your lord to warn people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded
Al-Qasas,41,0.3387,0.107,0.756,0.136,and if not that disaster should strike them for what their hand put forth of sin and they would say our lord why did you not send u messenger so we could have followed your verse and been among the believer
Al-Qasas,54,0.7556,0.044,0.806,0.15,but when the truth came to them from u they said why wa he not given like that which wa given to moses did they not disbelieve in that which wa given to moses before they said they are but two work of magic supporting each other and indeed we are in both disbeliever
Al-Qasas,23,0.4588,0.0,0.88,0.12,say then bring scripture from allah which is more guiding than either of them that may follow it if you should be truthful
Al-Qasas,40,0.7964,0.0,0.843,0.157,but if they do not respond to you then know that they only follow their own desire and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from allah indeed allah doe not guide the wrongdoing people
Al-Qasas,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have repeatedly conveyed to them the qur an that they might be reminded
Al-Qasas,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the scripture before it they are believer in it
Al-Qasas,32,0.3182,0.0,0.931,0.069,and when it is recited to them they say we have believed in it indeed it is the truth from our lord indeed we were even before it muslim submitting to allah
Al-Qasas,28,0.128,0.166,0.654,0.18,those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and because they avert evil through good and from what we have provided them they spend
Al-Qasas,34,0.3641,0.073,0.787,0.139,and when they hear ill speech they turn away from it and say for u are our deed and for you are your deed peace will be upon you we seek not the ignorant
Al-Qasas,24,0.1901,0.0,0.929,0.071,indeed muhammad you do not guide whom you like but allah guide whom he will and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
Al-Qasas,47,0.2382,0.0,0.958,0.042,and they say if we were to follow the guidance with you we would be swept from our land have we not established for them safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruit of all thing a provision from u but most of them do not know

Al-Qasas,35,-0.09,0.082,0.845,0.073,and never would your lord have destroyed the city until he had sent to their mother messenger reciting to them our verse and we would not destroy the city except while their people were wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,36,0.8316,0.0,0.789,0.211,and whatever thing you people have been given it is only for the enjoyment of worldly life and it adornment and what is with allah is better and more lasting so will you not use reason

Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but the information will be unapparent to them that day so they will not be able to ask one another
Al-Qasas,23,0.8573,0.0,0.703,0.297,but a for one who had repented believed and done righteousness it is promised by allah that he will be among the successful
Al-Qasas,26,0.2732,0.0,0.923,0.077,and your lord creates what he will and chooses not for them wa the choice exalted is allah and high above what they associate with him

Al-Qasas,33,0.6705,0.0,0.849,0.151,and out of his mercy he made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and by day seek from his bounty and that perhaps you will be grateful
Al-Qasas,20,-0.1027,0.069,0.931,0.0,and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partner which you used to claim
Al-Qasas,34,0.0,0.063,0.874,0.063,and we will extract from every nation witness and say produce your proof and they will know that the truth belongs to allah and lost from them is that which they used to invent
Al-Qasas,42,-0.5566,0.197,0.672,0.132,indeed qarun wa from the people of moses but he tyrannized them and we gave him of treasure whose key would burden band of strong men thereupon his people said to him do not exult indeed allah doe not like the exultant
Al-Qasas,47,0.9377,0.08,0.609,0.311,but seek through that which allah ha given you the home of the hereafter and yet do not forget your share of the world and do good a allah ha done good to you and desire not corruption in the land indeed allah doe not like corrupters
Al-Qasas,46,-0.8402,0.203,0.699,0.098,he said wa only given it because of knowledge have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him of generation those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation of wealth but the criminal about their sin will not be asked
Al-Qasas,35,0.875,0.0,0.738,0.262,so he came out before his people in his adornment those who desired the worldly life said oh would that we had like what wa given to qarun indeed he is one of great fortune
Al-Qasas,32,0.6237,0.136,0.656,0.208,but those who had been given knowledge said woe to you the reward of allah is better for he who belief and doe righteousness and none are granted it except the patient
Al-Qasas,33,-0.296,0.064,0.936,0.0,and we caused the earth to swallow him and his home and there wa for him no company to aid him other than allah nor wa he of those who could defend themselves
Al-Qasas,53,-0.1847,0.088,0.837,0.075,and those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say oh how allah extends provision to whom he will of his servant and restricts it if not that allah had conferred favor on u he would have caused it to swallow u oh how the disbeliever do not succeed
Al-Qasas,27,0.4482,0.072,0.795,0.134,that home of the hereafter we assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption and the best outcome is for the righteous
Al-Qasas,41,-0.6124,0.177,0.706,0.117,whoever come on the day of judgement with good deed will have better than it and whoever come with an evil deed then those who did evil deed will not be recompensed except a much a what they used to do

Al-Ankabut,27,0.34,0.0,0.915,0.085,and we certainly sent noah to his people and he remained among them thousand year minus fifty year and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoer
Al-Ankabut,18,0.5719,0.0,0.821,0.179,but we saved him and the companion of the ship and we made it sign for the world
Al-Ankabut,24,0.4939,0.105,0.686,0.209,and we sent abraham when he said to his people worship allah and fear him that is best for you if you should know

Al-Ankabut,31,0.569,0.053,0.79,0.157,and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb and he said my people worship allah and expect the last day and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
Al-Ankabut,18,-0.7964,0.307,0.693,0.0,but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corps fallen prone
Al-Ankabut,38,0.2263,0.158,0.644,0.198,and we destroyed aad and thamud and it ha become clear to you from their ruined dwelling and satan had made pleasing to them their deed and averted them from the path and they were endowed with perception
Al-Ankabut,33,-0.7717,0.216,0.738,0.046,and we destroyed qarun and pharaoh and haman and moses had already come to them with clear evidence and they were arrogant in the land but they were not outrunners of our punishment
Al-Ankabut,68,-0.4673,0.066,0.91,0.024,so each we seized for his sin and among them were those upon whom we sent storm of stone and among them were those who were seized by the blast from the sky and among them were those whom we caused the earth to swallow and among them were those whom we drowned and allah would not have wronged them but it wa they who were wronging themselves
Al-Ankabut,35,-0.2023,0.085,0.851,0.064,the example of those who take ally other than allah is like that of the spider who take home and indeed the weakest of home is the home of the spider if they only knew

Al-Ankabut,27,0.1779,0.081,0.814,0.104,and you did not recite before it any scripture nor did you inscribe one with your right hand otherwise the falsifier would have had cause for doubt
Al-Ankabut,26,0.3089,0.0,0.917,0.083,rather the qur an is distinct verse preserved within the breast of those who have been given knowledge and none reject our verse except the wrongdoer

Yaseen,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we placed therein garden of palm tree and grapevine and caused to burst forth therefrom some spring
Yaseen,20,0.1828,0.105,0.76,0.135,that they may eat of his fruit and their hand have not produced it so will they not be grateful

Yaseen,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and sign for them is that we carried their forefather in laden ship
Yaseen,14,0.5423,0.0,0.727,0.273,and we created for them from the like of it that which they ride
Yaseen,25,-0.7351,0.274,0.64,0.085,and if we should will we could drown them then no one responding to cry would there be for them nor would they be saved

Yaseen,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if we willed we could have deformed them paralyzing them in their place so they would not be able to proceed nor could they return
Yaseen,17,0.5574,0.0,0.765,0.235,and he to whom we grant long life we reverse in creation so will they not understand
Yaseen,25,0.5267,0.0,0.876,0.124,and we did not give prophet muhammad knowledge of poetry nor is it befitting for him it is not but message and clear qur an
Yaseen,12,0.296,0.1,0.714,0.186,to warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbeliever

Yaseen,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have tamed them for them so some of them they ride and some of them they eat
Yaseen,15,0.1331,0.134,0.703,0.162,and for them therein are other benefit and drink so will they not be grateful
Yaseen,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but they have taken besides allah false deity that perhaps they would be helped
Yaseen,16,-0.3089,0.131,0.869,0.0,they are not able to help them and they themselves are for them soldier in attendance

As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when they are reminded they remember not
As-Saaffaat,7,-0.4588,0.333,0.667,0.0,and when they see sign they ridicule
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and say this is not but obvious magic
As-Saaffaat,15,-0.5574,0.205,0.795,0.0,when we have died and become dust and bone are we indeed to be resurrected
As-Saaffaat,5,0.2732,0.0,0.588,0.412,and our forefather a well
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0258,0.23,0.531,0.239,say yes and you will be rendered contemptible

As-Saaffaat,18,0.5574,0.125,0.565,0.31,the angel will be ordered gather those who committed wrong their kind and what they used to worship
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,other than allah and guide them to the path of hellfire
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.3818,0.34,0.66,0.0,and stop them indeed they are to be questioned
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.6551,0.277,0.723,0.0,they will be asked what is wrong with you why do you not help each other
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but they that day are in surrender
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.4939,0.286,0.714,0.0,and they will approach one another blaming each other
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will say indeed you used to come at u from the right
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the oppressor will say rather you yourselves were not believer
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.1154,0.125,0.784,0.09,and we had over you no authority but you were transgressing people
As-Saaffaat,17,-0.2023,0.163,0.714,0.122,so the word of our lord ha come into effect upon u indeed we will taste punishment

As-Saaffaat,16,-0.7096,0.296,0.704,0.0,indeed they when it wa said to them there is no deity but allah were arrogant
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.3182,0.284,0.581,0.135,and were saying are we to leave our god for mad poet
As-Saaffaat,13,0.5719,0.0,0.701,0.299,rather the prophet ha come with the truth and confirmed the previous messenger
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.7269,0.433,0.567,0.0,indeed you disbeliever will be taster of the painful punishment
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but not the chosen servant of allah

As-Saaffaat,6,0.4847,0.0,0.614,0.386,then are we not to die
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.3442,0.254,0.585,0.161,except for our first death and we will not be punished
As-Saaffaat,6,0.6249,0.0,0.549,0.451,indeed this is the great attainment
As-Saaffaat,11,0.3612,0.0,0.8,0.2,for the like of this let the worker on earth work
As-Saaffaat,9,0.7964,0.0,0.496,0.504,is paradise better accommodation or the tree of zaqqum
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we have made it torment for the wrongdoer
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed it is tree issuing from the bottom of the hellfire
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.6597,0.328,0.672,0.0,it emerging fruit a if it wa head of the devil
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed they will eat from it and fill with it their belly

As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then indeed their return will be to the hellfire
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed they found their father astray
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they hastened to follow in their footstep
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and there had already strayed before them most of the former people
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we had already sent among them warner
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.2732,0.174,0.826,0.0,then look how wa the end of those who were warned
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but not the chosen servant of allah
As-Saaffaat,13,0.765,0.0,0.602,0.398,and noah had certainly called u and we are the best of responder
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7845,0.0,0.566,0.434,and we saved him and his family from the great affliction
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made his descendant those remaining on the earth
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4767,0.0,0.721,0.279,and left for him favorable mention among later generation
As-Saaffaat,6,0.5423,0.0,0.588,0.412,peace upon noah among the world
As-Saaffaat,8,0.765,0.0,0.476,0.524,indeed we thus reward the doer of good
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed he wa of our believing servant
As-Saaffaat,5,-0.5994,0.494,0.506,0.0,then we drowned the disbeliever
As-Saaffaat,7,0.5267,0.0,0.638,0.362,and indeed among his kind wa abraham
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when he came to his lord with sound heart
As-Saaffaat,14,0.296,0.0,0.855,0.145,and when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
As-Saaffaat,10,0.5859,0.0,0.593,0.407,is it falsehood a god other than allah you desire
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then what is your thought about the lord of the world
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he cast look at the star
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.4215,0.286,0.714,0.0,and said indeed am about to be ill
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they turned away from him departing
As-Saaffaat,12,0.2732,0.0,0.84,0.16,then he turned to their god and said do you not eat
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.4767,0.256,0.744,0.0,what is wrong with you that you do not speak
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4939,0.0,0.738,0.262,and he turned upon them blow with his right hand
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the people came toward him hastening
As-Saaffaat,10,0.296,0.0,0.804,0.196,he said do you worship that which you yourselves carve
As-Saaffaat,9,0.25,0.0,0.8,0.2,while allah created you and that which you do
As-Saaffaat,13,-0.34,0.167,0.833,0.0,they said construct for him furnace and throw him into the burning fire
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they intended for him plan but we made them the most debased
As-Saaffaat,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and then he said indeed will go to where am ordered by my lord he will guide me
As-Saaffaat,9,0.3612,0.0,0.762,0.238,my lord grant me child from among the righteous
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,so we gave him good tidings of forbearing boy
As-Saaffaat,47,0.5267,0.0,0.888,0.112,and when he reached with him the age of exertion he said my son indeed have seen in dream that must sacrifice you so see what you think he said my father do a you are commanded you will find me if allah will of the steadfast
As-Saaffaat,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead
As-Saaffaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we called to him abraham
As-Saaffaat,13,0.886,0.0,0.441,0.559,you have fulfilled the vision indeed we thus reward the doer of good
As-Saaffaat,6,0.3818,0.0,0.658,0.342,indeed this wa the clear trial
As-Saaffaat,7,0.6249,0.0,0.594,0.406,and we ransomed him with great sacrifice
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4767,0.0,0.744,0.256,and we left for him favorable mention among later generation
As-Saaffaat,3,0.5423,0.0,0.364,0.636,peace upon abraham
As-Saaffaat,8,0.765,0.0,0.476,0.524,indeed we thus reward the doer of good

As-Saaffaat,21,0.6597,0.142,0.543,0.315,and we blessed him and isaac but among their descendant is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself
As-Saaffaat,10,0.6249,0.0,0.611,0.389,and we did certainly confer favor upon moses and aaron
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7845,0.0,0.566,0.434,and we saved them and their people from the great affliction
As-Saaffaat,10,0.3182,0.0,0.796,0.204,and we supported them so it wa they who overcame
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we gave them the explicit scripture
As-Saaffaat,8,0.2263,0.0,0.787,0.213,and we guided them on the straight path
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4767,0.0,0.744,0.256,and we left for them favorable mention among later generation
As-Saaffaat,5,0.5423,0.0,0.533,0.467,peace upon moses and aaron

As-Saaffaat,5,-0.4939,0.444,0.556,0.0,then we destroyed the others
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed you pas by them in the morning
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and at night then will you not use reason
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed jonah wa among the messenger

As-Saaffaat,9,-0.5106,0.292,0.708,0.0,then the fish swallowed him while he wa blameworthy
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and had he not been of those who exalt allah
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he would have remained inside it belly until the day they are resurrected
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.5719,0.252,0.748,0.0,but we threw him onto the open shore while he wa ill
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we caused to grow over him gourd vine
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent him to his people of hundred thousand or more
As-Saaffaat,12,0.5574,0.0,0.753,0.247,and they believed so we gave them enjoyment of life for time
As-Saaffaat,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so inquire of them muhammad doe your lord have daughter while they have son
As-Saaffaat,12,0.2732,0.0,0.826,0.174,or did we create the angel a female while they were witness
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,unquestionably it is out of their invented falsehood that they say
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.2263,0.282,0.513,0.205,allah ha begotten and indeed they are liar

As-Saaffaat,27,-0.6486,0.142,0.858,0.0,and they have claimed between him and the jinni lineage but the jinni have already known that they who made such claim will be brought to punishment

As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we would have been the chosen servant of allah
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but they disbelieved in it so they are going to know
As-Saaffaat,11,0.34,0.0,0.806,0.194,and our word ha already preceded for our servant the messenger
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that indeed they would be those given victory
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and that indeed our soldier will be those who overcome

Saad,25,0.5106,0.0,0.879,0.121,or is theirs the dominion of the heaven and the earth and what is between them then let them ascend through any way of access
Saad,14,-0.631,0.242,0.758,0.0,they are but soldier who will be defeated there among the company of disbeliever

Ash_Shooraa,47,0.6249,0.131,0.701,0.168,and thus we have revealed to you an arabic qur an that you may warn the mother of city makkah and those around it and warn of the day of assembly about which there is no doubt party will be in paradise and party in the blaze
Ash_Shooraa,30,0.8462,0.0,0.747,0.253,and if allah willed he could have made them of one religion but he admits whom he will into his mercy and the wrongdoer have not any protector or helper
Ash_Shooraa,29,-0.6124,0.166,0.752,0.082,or have they taken protector or ally besides him but allah he is the protector and he give life to the dead and he is over all thing competent
Ash_Shooraa,30,-0.3818,0.082,0.918,0.0,and in anything over which you disagree it ruling is to be referred to allah say that is allah my lord upon him have relied and to him turn back

Ash_Shooraa,71,0.128,0.034,0.913,0.054,he ha ordained for you of religion what he enjoined upon noah and that which we have revealed to you muhammad and what we enjoined upon abraham and moses and jesus to establish the religion and not be divided therein difficult for those who associate others with allah is that to which you invite them allah chooses for himself whom he will and guide to himself whoever turn back to him
Ash_Shooraa,60,-0.872,0.187,0.784,0.029,and they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and if not for word that preceded from your lord postponing the penalty until specified time it would have been concluded between them and indeed those who were granted inheritance of the scripture after them are concerning it in disquieting doubt
Ash_Shooraa,84,0.4497,0.067,0.833,0.1,so to that religion of allah invite muhammad and remain on right course a you are commanded and do not follow their inclination but say have believed in what allah ha revealed of the qur an and have been commanded to do justice among you allah is our lord and your lord for u are our deed and for you your deed there is no need for argument between u and you allah will bring u together and to him is the final destination

Ash_Shooraa,37,-0.8765,0.271,0.667,0.062,those who do not believe in it are impatient for it but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth unquestionably those who dispute concerning the hour are in extreme error
Ash_Shooraa,22,0.4215,0.0,0.882,0.118,allah is subtle with his servant he give provision to whom he will and he is the powerful the exalted in might
Ash_Shooraa,37,0.7311,0.0,0.802,0.198,whoever desire the harvest of the hereafter we increase for him in his harvest and whoever desire the harvest of this world we give him thereof but there is not for him in the hereafter any share
Ash_Shooraa,39,-0.8573,0.217,0.747,0.036,or have they other deity who have ordained for them religion to which allah ha not consented but if not for the decisive word it would have been concluded between them and indeed the wrongdoer will have painful punishment
Ash_Shooraa,53,0.8176,0.051,0.779,0.17,you will see the wrongdoer fearful of what they have earned and it will certainly befall them and those who have believed and done righteous deed will be in lush region of the garden in paradise having whatever they will in the presence of their lord that is what is the great bounty
Ash_Shooraa,53,0.9784,0.0,0.631,0.369,it is that of which allah give good tidings to his servant who believe and do righteous deed say muhammad do not ask you for this message any payment but only good will through kinship and whoever commits good deed we will increase for him good therein indeed allah is forgiving and appreciative
Ash_Shooraa,40,0.5647,0.0,0.891,0.109,or do they say he ha invented about allah lie but if allah willed he could seal over your heart and allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by his word indeed he is knowing of that within the breast
Ash_Shooraa,19,0.5574,0.0,0.787,0.213,and it is he who accepts repentance from his servant and pardon misdeed and he know what you do
Ash_Shooraa,28,-0.7935,0.224,0.728,0.048,and he answer the supplication of those who have believed and done righteous deed and increase for them from his bounty but the disbeliever will have severe punishment
Ash_Shooraa,38,0.1406,0.0,0.96,0.04,and if allah had extended excessively provision for his servant they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth but he sends it down in an amount which he will indeed he is of his servant acquainted and seeing
Ash_Shooraa,24,0.34,0.12,0.682,0.198,and it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spread his mercy and he is the protector the praiseworthy
Ash_Shooraa,31,0.8442,0.0,0.728,0.272,and of his sign is the creation of the heaven and earth and what he ha dispersed throughout them of creature and he for gathering them when he will is competent
Ash_Shooraa,18,0.3071,0.166,0.613,0.221,and whatever strike you of disaster it is for what your hand have earned but he pardon much
Ash_Shooraa,21,0.6251,0.0,0.788,0.212,and you will not cause failure to allah upon the earth and you have not besides allah any protector or helper
Ash_Shooraa,12,0.3612,0.0,0.815,0.185,and of his sign are the ship in the sea like mountain
Ash_Shooraa,26,0.4588,0.0,0.893,0.107,if he willed he could still the wind and they would remain motionless on it surface indeed in that are sign for everyone patient and grateful
Ash_Shooraa,13,0.1779,0.139,0.679,0.182,or he could destroy them for what they earned but he pardon much
Ash_Shooraa,21,-0.5367,0.208,0.724,0.068,and that is so those who dispute concerning our sign may know that for them there is no place of escape
Ash_Shooraa,36,0.8674,0.0,0.795,0.205,so whatever thing you have been given it is but for enjoyment of the worldly life but what is with allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their lord rely
Ash_Shooraa,16,-0.8225,0.45,0.462,0.088,and those who avoid the major sin and immorality and when they are angry they forgive
Ash_Shooraa,29,0.34,0.0,0.921,0.079,and those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is determined by consultation among themselves and from what we have provided them they spend
Ash_Shooraa,10,-0.128,0.143,0.857,0.0,and those who when tyranny strike them they defend themselves
Ash_Shooraa,31,0.8225,0.124,0.576,0.3,and the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it but whoever pardon and make reconciliation his reward is due from allah indeed he doe not like wrongdoer
Ash_Shooraa,17,-0.6486,0.261,0.739,0.0,and whoever avenges himself after having been wronged those have not upon them any cause for blame
Ash_Shooraa,23,-0.8481,0.315,0.685,0.0,the cause is only against the one who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right those will have painful punishment
Ash_Shooraa,14,0.6705,0.0,0.629,0.371,and whoever is patient and forgives indeed that is of the matter requiring determination
Ash_Shooraa,36,-0.6597,0.137,0.863,0.0,and he whom allah sends astray for him there is no protector beyond him and you will see the wrongdoer when they see the punishment saying is there for return to the former world any way
Ash_Shooraa,51,-0.91,0.258,0.697,0.044,and you will see them being exposed to the fire humbled from humiliation looking from behind covert glance and those who had believed will say indeed the true loser are the one who lost themselves and their family on the day of resurrection unquestionably the wrongdoer are in an enduring punishment
Ash_Shooraa,26,-0.296,0.081,0.919,0.0,and there will not be for them any ally to aid them other than allah and whoever allah sends astray for him there is no way
Ash_Shooraa,30,-0.5267,0.136,0.864,0.0,respond to your lord before day come from allah of which there is no repelling no refuge will you have that day nor for you will there be any denial
Ash_Shooraa,55,0.1531,0.145,0.688,0.168,but if they turn away then we have not sent you muhammad over them a guardian upon you is only the duty of notification and indeed when we let man taste mercy from u he rejoices in it but if evil afflicts him for what his hand have put forth then indeed man is ungrateful
Ash_Shooraa,32,0.6597,0.0,0.847,0.153,to allah belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth he creates what he will he give to whom he will female child and he give to whom he will male
Ash_Shooraa,21,0.3182,0.0,0.897,0.103,or he make them both male and female and he render whom he will barren indeed he is knowing and competent
Ash_Shooraa,41,0.5209,0.0,0.922,0.078,and it is not for any human being that allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind partition or that he sends messenger to reveal by his permission what he will indeed he is most high and wise
Ash_Shooraa,48,0.6652,0.0,0.875,0.125,and thus we have revealed to you an inspiration of our command you did not know what is the book or what is faith but we have made it light by which we guide whom we will of our servant and indeed muhammad you guide to straight path
Ash_Shooraa,25,0.5267,0.0,0.839,0.161,the path of allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heaven and whatever is on the earth unquestionably to allah do all matter evolve

Az-Zukhruf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we have made it an arabic qur an that you might understand
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.5267,0.0,0.815,0.185,and indeed it is in the mother of the book with u exalted and full of wisdom
Az-Zukhruf,14,-0.2263,0.128,0.872,0.0,then should we turn the message away disregarding you because you are transgressing people

Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.6124,0.222,0.778,0.0,but there would not come to them prophet except that they used to ridicule him
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.1779,0.139,0.649,0.212,and we destroyed greater than them in striking power and the example of the former people ha preceded
Az-Zukhruf,28,0.891,0.0,0.646,0.354,and if you should ask them who ha created the heaven and the earth they would surely say they were created by the exalted in might the knowing
Az-Zukhruf,22,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,the one who ha made for you the earth bed and made for you upon it road that you might be guided
Az-Zukhruf,23,-0.4404,0.155,0.758,0.087,and who sends down rain from the sky in measured amount and we revive thereby dead land thus will you be brought forth

Az-Zukhruf,41,0.6249,0.0,0.882,0.118,that you may settle yourselves upon their back and then remember the favor of your lord when you have settled upon them and say exalted is he who ha subjected this to u and we could not have otherwise subdued it
Az-Zukhruf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,and indeed we to our lord will surely return
Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.1154,0.195,0.633,0.173,but they have attributed to him from his servant portion indeed man is clearly ungrateful
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.7003,0.0,0.673,0.327,or ha he taken out of what he ha created daughter and chosen you for having son
Az-Zukhruf,28,-0.0772,0.1,0.81,0.09,and when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attribute to the most merciful in comparison his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.3182,0.141,0.859,0.0,so is one brought up in ornament while being during conflict unevident attributed to allah
Az-Zukhruf,29,0.1779,0.046,0.885,0.069,and they have made the angel who are servant of the most merciful female did they witness their creation their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned
Az-Zukhruf,26,-0.3816,0.13,0.87,0.0,and they said if the most merciful had willed we would not have worshipped them they have of that no knowledge they are not but falsifying
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or have we given them book before the qur an to which they are adhering
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,rather they say indeed we found our father upon religion and we are in their footstep rightly guided
Az-Zukhruf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and similarly we did not send before you any warner into city except that it affluent said indeed we found our father upon religion and we are in their footstep following
Az-Zukhruf,31,0.4404,0.0,0.912,0.088,each warner said even if brought you better guidance than that religion upon which you found your father they said indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbeliever
Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.3612,0.152,0.848,0.0,so we took retribution from them then see how wa the end of the denier
Az-Zukhruf,20,0.296,0.0,0.896,0.104,and mention muhammad when abraham said to his father and his people indeed am disassociated from that which you worship
Az-Zukhruf,12,0.25,0.0,0.846,0.154,except for he who created me and indeed he will guide me
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he made it word remaining among his descendant that they might return to it
Az-Zukhruf,21,0.8176,0.0,0.679,0.321,however gave enjoyment to these people of makkah and their father until there came to them the truth and clear messenger
Az-Zukhruf,19,0.4497,0.0,0.859,0.141,but when the truth came to them they said this is magic and indeed we are concerning it disbeliever
Az-Zukhruf,20,0.6249,0.0,0.823,0.177,and they said why wa this qur an not sent down upon great man from one of the two city
Az-Zukhruf,58,0.85,0.0,0.84,0.16,do they distribute the mercy of your lord it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degree of rank that they may make use of one another for service but the mercy of your lord is better than whatever they accumulate
Az-Zukhruf,38,-0.296,0.056,0.944,0.0,and if it were not that the people would become one community of disbeliever we would have made for those who disbelieve in the most merciful for their house ceiling and stairway of silver upon which to mount
Az-Zukhruf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and for their house door and couch of silver upon which to recline
Az-Zukhruf,24,-0.5975,0.145,0.855,0.0,and gold ornament but all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life and the hereafter with your lord is for the righteous
Az-Zukhruf,21,-0.6597,0.18,0.82,0.0,and whoever is blinded from remembrance of the most merciful we appoint for him devil and he is to him companion
Az-Zukhruf,19,-0.7269,0.264,0.736,0.0,and indeed the devil avert them from the way of guidance while they think that they are rightly guided
Az-Zukhruf,31,0.4019,0.0,0.915,0.085,until when he come to u at judgement he say to his companion oh wish there wa between me and you the distance between the east and west how wretched companion
Az-Zukhruf,20,-0.6985,0.313,0.584,0.102,and never will it benefit you that day when you have wronged that you are all sharing in the punishment
Az-Zukhruf,19,-0.4215,0.225,0.667,0.108,then will you make the deaf hear muhammad or guide the blind or he who is in clear error
Az-Zukhruf,17,-0.5994,0.196,0.804,0.0,and whether or not we take you away in death indeed we will take retribution upon them
Az-Zukhruf,19,0.8176,0.0,0.653,0.347,or whether or not we show you that which we have promised them indeed we are perfect in ability
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.2263,0.0,0.881,0.119,so adhere to that which is revealed to you indeed you are on straight path
Az-Zukhruf,18,-0.1027,0.076,0.924,0.0,and indeed it is remembrance for you and your people and you all are going to be questioned
Az-Zukhruf,21,0.5719,0.0,0.844,0.156,and ask those we sent before you of our messenger have we made besides the most merciful deity to be worshipped
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.34,0.0,0.915,0.085,and certainly did we send moses with our sign to pharaoh and his establishment and he said indeed am the messenger of the lord of the world
Az-Zukhruf,13,0.6124,0.0,0.75,0.25,but when he brought them our sign at once they laughed at them
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.6486,0.0,0.825,0.175,and we showed them not sign except that it wa greater than it sister and we seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return to faith
Az-Zukhruf,22,0.5994,0.0,0.795,0.205,and they said to moses magician invoke for u your lord by what he ha promised you indeed we will be guided
Az-Zukhruf,14,-0.5719,0.222,0.778,0.0,but when we removed from them the affliction at once they broke their word
Az-Zukhruf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and pharaoh called out among his people he said my people doe not the kingdom of egypt belong to me and these river flowing beneath me then do you not see
Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.3548,0.251,0.627,0.122,or am not better than this one who is insignificant and hardly make himself clear
Az-Zukhruf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then why have there not been placed upon him bracelet of gold or come with him the angel in conjunction
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he bluffed his people and they obeyed him indeed they were themselves people defiantly disobedient of allah
Az-Zukhruf,14,-0.802,0.396,0.604,0.0,and when they angered u we took retribution from them and drowned them all
Az-Zukhruf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made them precedent and an example for the later people
Az-Zukhruf,16,0.4588,0.0,0.824,0.176,and when the son of mary wa presented a an example immediately your people laughed aloud
Az-Zukhruf,29,-0.4215,0.157,0.74,0.104,and they said are your god better or is he they did not present the comparison except for mere argument but in fact they are people prone to dispute
Az-Zukhruf,21,0.5499,0.0,0.849,0.151,jesus wa not but servant upon whom we bestowed favor and we made him an example for the child of israel
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.4939,0.0,0.842,0.158,and if we willed we could have made instead of you angel succeeding one another on the earth
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.4606,0.0,0.852,0.148,and indeed jesus will be sign for knowledge of the hour so be not in doubt of it and follow me this is straight path
Az-Zukhruf,13,-0.0982,0.199,0.568,0.234,and never let satan avert you indeed he is to you clear enemy
Az-Zukhruf,33,0.5398,0.099,0.695,0.206,and when jesus brought clear proof he said have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ so fear allah and obey me
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.5812,0.0,0.732,0.268,indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him this is straight path
Az-Zukhruf,22,-0.9579,0.485,0.515,0.0,but the denomination from among them differed and separated so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of painful day

Al-Ahqaaf,39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and mention muhammad when we directed to you few of the jinni listening to the qur an and when they attended it they said listen quietly and when it wa concluded they went back to their people a warner
Al-Ahqaaf,27,0.4939,0.0,0.856,0.144,they said our people indeed we have heard recited book revealed after moses confirming what wa before it which guide to the truth and to straight path
Al-Ahqaaf,25,-0.7184,0.282,0.581,0.137,our people respond to the messenger of allah and believe in him allah will forgive for you your sin and protect you from painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,33,0.0008,0.093,0.814,0.093,but he who doe not respond to the caller of allah will not cause failure to him upon earth and he will not have besides him any protector those are in manifest error
Al-Ahqaaf,35,0.8381,0.09,0.589,0.321,do they not see that allah who created the heaven and earth and did not fail in their creation is able to give life to the dead yes indeed he is over all thing competent
Al-Ahqaaf,39,-0.7478,0.237,0.706,0.058,and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire it will be said is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will say then taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
Al-Ahqaaf,59,0.4382,0.051,0.837,0.112,so be patient muhammad a were those of determination among the messenger and do not be impatient for them it will be on the day they see that which they are promised a though they had not remained in the world except an hour of day this is notification and will any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people
Muhammad,16,-0.6908,0.34,0.66,0.0,those who disbelieve and avert people from the way of allah he will waste their deed
Muhammad,37,0.5719,0.0,0.882,0.118,and those who believe and do righteous deed and believe in what ha been sent down upon muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he will remove from them their misdeed and amend their condition
Muhammad,27,0.0258,0.075,0.847,0.078,that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus doe allah present to the people their comparison
Muhammad,86,-0.8934,0.181,0.754,0.065,so when you meet those who disbelieve in battle strike their neck until when you have inflicted slaughter upon them then secure their bond and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lay down it burden that is the command and if allah had willed he could have taken vengeance upon them himself but he ordered armed struggle to test some of you by mean of others and those who are killed in the cause of allah never will he waste their deed
Muhammad,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he will guide them and amend their condition
Muhammad,12,0.8126,0.0,0.517,0.483,and admit them to paradise which he ha made known to them
Muhammad,17,0.6597,0.0,0.735,0.265,you who have believed if you support allah he will support you and plant firmly your foot
Muhammad,14,-0.9109,0.512,0.488,0.0,but those who disbelieve for them is misery and he will waste their deed
Muhammad,14,-0.7063,0.328,0.672,0.0,that is because they disliked what allah revealed so he rendered worthless their deed
Muhammad,29,-0.4939,0.103,0.897,0.0,have they not traveled through the land and seen how wa the end of those before them allah destroyed everything over them and for the disbeliever is something comparable
Muhammad,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,that is because allah is the protector of those who have believed and because the disbeliever have no protector
Muhammad,38,-0.0516,0.132,0.74,0.128,indeed allah will admit those who have believed and done righteous deed to garden beneath which river flow but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat a grazing livestock eat and the fire will be residence for them
Muhammad,24,-0.1027,0.178,0.658,0.164,and how many city wa stronger than your city makkah which drove you out we destroyed them and there wa no helper for them
Muhammad,30,0.7717,0.106,0.578,0.316,so is he who is on clear evidence from his lord like him to whom the evil of his work ha been made attractive and they follow their own desire
Muhammad,75,0.9118,0.028,0.799,0.174,is the description of paradise which the righteous are promised wherein are river of water unaltered river of milk the taste of which never change river of wine delicious to those who drink and river of purified honey in which they will have from all kind of fruit and forgiveness from their lord like that of those who abide eternally in the fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestine
Muhammad,49,0.7579,0.0,0.86,0.14,and among them muhammad are those who listen to you until when they depart from you they say to those who were given knowledge what ha he said just now those are the one of whom allah ha sealed over their heart and who have followed their own desire
Muhammad,15,0.3182,0.0,0.859,0.141,and those who are guided he increase them in guidance and give them their righteousness
Muhammad,35,0.7992,0.0,0.797,0.203,then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedly but already there have come some of it indication then what good to them when it ha come will be their remembrance
Muhammad,34,-0.5719,0.149,0.797,0.054,so know muhammad that there is no deity except allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing woman and allah know of your movement and your resting place
Muhammad,48,-0.836,0.156,0.814,0.031,those who believe say why ha surah not been sent down but when precise surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose heart is hypocrisy looking at you with look of one overcome by death and more appropriate for them would have been
Muhammad,26,0.8225,0.072,0.578,0.35,obedience and good word and when the matter of fighting wa determined if they had been true to allah it would have been better for them
Muhammad,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so would you perhaps if you turned away cause corruption on earth and sever your tie of relationship
Muhammad,19,0.5267,0.0,0.794,0.206,those who do so are the one that allah ha cursed so he deafened them and blinded their vision
Muhammad,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then do they not reflect upon the qur an or are there lock upon their heart
Muhammad,22,0.6705,0.0,0.784,0.216,indeed those who reverted back to disbelief after guidance had become clear to them satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them
Muhammad,28,-0.3818,0.091,0.872,0.037,that is because they said to those who disliked what allah sent down we will obey you in part of the matter and allah know what they conceal
Muhammad,18,-0.5994,0.187,0.813,0.0,then how will it be when the angel take them in death striking their face and their back
Muhammad,20,-0.6666,0.317,0.554,0.128,that is because they followed what angered allah and disliked what earns his pleasure so he rendered worthless their deed
Muhammad,18,-0.6281,0.253,0.681,0.066,or do those in whose heart is disease think that allah would never expose their feeling of hatred
Muhammad,35,0.5927,0.0,0.898,0.102,and if we willed we could show them to you and you would know them by their mark but you will surely know them by the tone of their speech and allah know your deed
Muhammad,29,0.4404,0.0,0.906,0.094,and we will surely test you until we make evident those who strive among you for the cause of allah and the patient and we will test your affair
Muhammad,37,0.3071,0.098,0.774,0.128,indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and opposed the messenger after guidance had become clear to them never will they harm allah at all and he will render worthless their deed
Muhammad,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and do not invalidate your deed
Muhammad,24,-0.6921,0.242,0.758,0.0,indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and then died while they were disbeliever never will allah forgive them
Muhammad,28,0.9418,0.0,0.592,0.408,so do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior and allah is with you and will never deprive you of the reward of your deed
Muhammad,28,0.4588,0.093,0.727,0.18,this worldly life is only amusement and diversion and if you believe and fear allah he will give you your reward and not ask you for your property
Muhammad,19,-0.1531,0.082,0.918,0.0,if he should ask you for them and press you you would withhold and he would expose your unwillingness
Muhammad,63,0.0348,0.123,0.766,0.112,here you are those invited to spend in the cause of allah but among you are those who withhold out of greed and whoever withholds only withholds benefit from himself and allah is the free of need while you are the needy and if you turn away he will replace you with another people then they will not be the like of you
Al-Fath,8,0.3818,0.0,0.729,0.271,indeed we have given you muhammad clear conquest
Al-Fath,27,0.2732,0.108,0.691,0.201,that allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete his favor upon you and guide you to straight path
Al-Fath,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and that allah may aid you with mighty victory
Al-Fath,43,0.9442,0.0,0.684,0.316,it is he who sent down tranquillity into the heart of the believer that they would increase in faith along with their present faith and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth and ever is allah knowing and wise
Al-Fath,39,0.7096,0.0,0.862,0.138,and that he may admit the believing men and the believing woman to garden beneath which river flow to abide therein eternally and remove from them their misdeed and ever is that in the sight of allah great attainment
Al-Fath,57,-0.9674,0.313,0.601,0.086,and that he may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite woman and the polytheist men and polytheist woman those who assume about allah an assumption of evil nature upon them is misfortune of evil nature and allah ha become angry with them and ha cursed them and prepared for them hell and evil it is a destination
Al-Fath,21,0.7506,0.0,0.748,0.252,and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
Al-Fath,14,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,indeed we have sent you a witness and bringer of good tidings and warner
Al-Fath,23,0.743,0.0,0.769,0.231,that you people may believe in allah and his messenger and honor him and respect the prophet and exalt allah morning and afternoon
Al-Fath,53,0.9643,0.0,0.686,0.314,indeed those who pledge allegiance to you muhammad they are actually pledging allegiance to allah the hand of allah is over their hand so he who break his word only break it to the detriment of himself and he who fulfills that which he ha promised allah he will give him great reward
Al-Fath,62,0.2449,0.053,0.849,0.098,those who remained behind of the bedouin will say to you our property and our family occupied u so ask forgiveness for u they say with their tongue what is not within their heart say then who could prevent allah at all if he intended for you harm or intended for you benefit rather ever is allah with what you do acquainted
Al-Fath,35,-0.7684,0.219,0.683,0.098,but you thought that the messenger and the believer would never return to their family ever and that wa made pleasing in your heart and you assumed an assumption of evil and became people ruined
Al-Fath,19,0.5106,0.0,0.798,0.202,and whoever ha not believed in allah and his messenger then indeed we have prepared for the disbeliever blaze
Al-Fath,29,0.7003,0.084,0.676,0.241,and to allah belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth he forgives whom he will and punishes whom he will and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
Al-Fath,57,-0.2846,0.07,0.897,0.033,those who remained behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it let u follow you they wish to change the word of allah say never will you follow u thus did allah say before so they will say rather you envy u but in fact they were not understanding except little
Al-Fath,55,-0.8658,0.213,0.687,0.1,say to those who remained behind of the bedouin you will be called to face people of great military might you may fight them or they will submit so if you obey allah will give you good reward but if you turn away a you turned away before he will punish you with painful punishment

Al-Fath,39,0.8834,0.0,0.756,0.244,certainly wa allah pleased with the believer when they pledged allegiance to you muhammad under the tree and he knew what wa in their heart so he sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest
Al-Fath,17,-0.2023,0.177,0.682,0.141,and much war booty which they will take and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
Al-Fath,45,0.886,0.0,0.763,0.237,allah ha promised you much booty that you will take in the future and ha hastened for you this victory and withheld the hand of people from you that it may be sign for the believer and that he may guide you to straight path
Al-Fath,26,0.7184,0.0,0.767,0.233,and he promise other victory that you were so far unable to realize which allah ha already encompassed and ever is allah over all thing competent
Al-Fath,25,-0.2732,0.156,0.761,0.083,and if those makkans who disbelieve had fought you they would have turned their back in flight then they would not find protector or helper
Al-Fath,23,0.34,0.0,0.902,0.098,this is the established way of allah which ha occurred before and never will you find in the way of allah any change
Al-Fath,36,0.7506,0.0,0.842,0.158,and it is he who withheld their hand from you and your hand from them within the area of makkah after he caused you to overcome them and ever is allah of what you do seeing
Al-Fath,96,-0.5994,0.086,0.845,0.068,they are the one who disbelieved and obstructed you from al masjid al haram while the offering wa prevented from reaching it place of sacrifice and if not for believing men and believing woman whom you did not know that you might trample them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without your knowledge you would have been permitted to enter makkah this wa so that allah might admit to his mercy whom he willed if they had been apart from them we would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment
Al-Fath,57,0.7469,0.05,0.831,0.118,when those who disbelieved had put into their heart chauvinism the chauvinism of the time of ignorance but allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believer and imposed upon them the word of righteousness and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it and ever is allah of all thing knowing

Al-Fath,104,0.9612,0.03,0.772,0.198,muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are forceful against the disbeliever merciful among themselves you see them bowing and prostrating in prayer seeking bounty from allah and his pleasure their mark is on their face from the trace of prostration that is their description in the torah and their description in the gospel is a plant which produce it offshoot and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalk delighting the sower so that allah may enrage by them the disbeliever allah ha promised those who believe and do righteous deed among them forgiveness and great reward
Al-Hujuraat,22,-0.6486,0.17,0.83,0.0,you who have believed do not put yourselves before allah and his messenger but fear allah indeed allah is hearing and knowing
Al-Hujuraat,40,-0.1027,0.067,0.876,0.058,you who have believed do not raise your voice above the voice of the prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others lest your deed become worthless while you perceive not

Al-Hadeed,77,0.9753,0.073,0.626,0.301,know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and child like the example of rain whose resulting plant growth plea the tiller then it dry and you see it turned yellow then it becomes scattered debris and in the hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from allah and approval and what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion
Al-Hadeed,50,0.9169,0.0,0.764,0.236,race toward forgiveness from your lord and garden whose width is like the width of the heaven and earth prepared for those who believed in allah and his messenger that is the bounty of allah which he give to whom he will and allah is the possessor of great bounty
Al-Hadeed,27,-0.5994,0.231,0.682,0.086,no disaster strike upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in register before we bring it into being indeed that for allah is easy

Al-Hadeed,23,0.6486,0.088,0.678,0.234,those who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess and whoever turn away then indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
Al-Hadeed,66,0.9559,0.0,0.763,0.237,we have already sent our messenger with clear evidence and sent down with them the scripture and the balance that the people may maintain their affair in justice and we sent down iron wherein is great military might and benefit for the people and so that allah may make evident those who support him and his messenger unseen indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
Al-Hadeed,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have already sent noah and abraham and placed in their descendant prophethood and scripture and among them is he who is guided but many of them are defiantly disobedient
Al-Hadeed,85,0.8745,0.0,0.881,0.119,then we sent following their footstep our messenger and followed them with jesus the son of mary and gave him the gospel and we placed in the heart of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism which they innovated we did not prescribe it for them except that they did so seeking the approval of allah but they did not observe it with due observance so we gave the one who believed among them their reward but many of them are defiantly disobedient
Al-Hadeed,40,0.5106,0.069,0.771,0.161,you who have believed fear allah and believe in his messenger he will then give you double portion of his mercy and make for you light by which you will walk and forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful

Al-Hashr,22,0.7506,0.0,0.758,0.242,whatever is in the heaven and whatever is on the earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
Al-Hashr,82,-0.3685,0.152,0.72,0.127,it is he who expelled the one who disbelieved among the people of the scripture from their home at the first gathering you did not think they would leave and they thought that their fortress would protect them from allah but the decree of allah came upon them from where they had not expected and he cast terror into their heart so they destroyed their house by their own hand and the hand of the believer so take warning people of vision
Al-Hashr,30,-0.8225,0.242,0.758,0.0,and if not that allah had decreed for them evacuation he would have punished them in this world and for them in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire
Al-Hashr,20,-0.6808,0.237,0.763,0.0,that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah then indeed allah is severe in penalty
Al-Hashr,29,-0.6771,0.171,0.829,0.0,whatever you have cut down of their palm tree or left standing on their trunk it wa by permission of allah and so he would disgrace the defiantly disobedient
Al-Hashr,41,0.5647,0.0,0.893,0.107,and what allah restored of property to his messenger from them you did not spur for it in an expedition any horse or camel but allah give his messenger power over whom he will and allah is over all thing competent
Al-Hashr,71,-0.2023,0.136,0.738,0.126,and what allah restored to his messenger from the people of the town it is for allah and for the messenger and for his near relative and orphan and the stranded traveler so that it will not be perpetual distribution among the rich from among you and whatever the messenger ha given you take and what he ha forbidden you refrain from and fear allah indeed allah is severe in penalty
Al-Hashr,34,0.7269,0.115,0.632,0.253,for the poor emigrant who were expelled from their home and their property seeking bounty from allah and his approval and supporting allah and his messenger there is also share those are the truthful
Al-Hashr,67,0.9251,0.014,0.809,0.177,and also for those who were settled in al madinah and adopted the faith before them they love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breast of what the emigrant were given but give them preference over themselves even though they are in privation and whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
Al-Hashr,44,0.765,0.058,0.734,0.208,and there is share for those who came after them saying our lord forgive u and our brother who preceded u in faith and put not in our heart any resentment toward those who have believed our lord indeed you are kind and merciful
Al-Hashr,59,-0.5859,0.133,0.808,0.059,have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy saying to their brother who have disbelieved among the people of the scripture if you are expelled we will surely leave with you and we will not obey in regard to you anyone ever and if you are fought we will surely aid you but allah testifies that they are liar
Al-Hashr,40,-0.0649,0.097,0.812,0.091,if they are expelled they will not leave with them and if they are fought they will not aid them and even if they should aid them they will surely turn their back then thereafter they will not be aided
Al-Hashr,20,-0.5413,0.155,0.845,0.0,you believer are more fearful within their breast than allah that is because they are people who do not understand
Al-Hashr,40,-0.4133,0.101,0.862,0.037,they will not fight you all except within fortified city or from behind wall their violence among themselves is severe you think they are together but their heart are diverse that is because they are people who do not reason
Al-Hashr,24,-0.7964,0.299,0.623,0.078,theirs is like the example of those shortly before them they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have painful punishment
Al-Hashr,32,-0.631,0.161,0.791,0.048,the hypocrite are like the example of satan when he say to man disbelieve but when he disbelief he say indeed am disassociated from you indeed fear allah lord of the world
Al-Hashr,27,-0.6705,0.18,0.82,0.0,so the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the fire abiding eternally therein and that is the recompense of the wrong doer
Al-Hashr,30,-0.6124,0.179,0.754,0.067,you who have believed fear allah and let every soul look to what it ha put forth for tomorrow and fear allah indeed allah is acquainted with what you do

Al-Hashr,37,-0.4939,0.082,0.918,0.0,if we had sent down this qur an upon mountain you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of allah and these example we present to the people that perhaps they will give thought
Al-Hashr,25,-0.296,0.084,0.916,0.0,he is allah other than whom there is no deity knower of the unseen and the witnessed he is the entirely merciful the especially merciful
Al-Hashr,39,0.8316,0.047,0.742,0.212,he is allah other than whom there is no deity the sovereign the pure the perfection the bestower of faith the overseer the exalted in might the compeller the superior exalted is allah above whatever they associate with him
Al-Hashr,34,0.891,0.0,0.745,0.255,he is allah the creator the inventor the fashioner to him belong the best name whatever is in the heaven and earth is exalting him and he is the exalted in might the wise

Al-Mumtahanah,30,0.1779,0.23,0.478,0.292,if they gain dominance over you they would be to you a enemy and extend against you their hand and their tongue with evil and they wish you would disbelieve
Al-Mumtahanah,26,0.4588,0.0,0.893,0.107,never will your relative or your child benefit you the day of resurrection he will judge between you and allah of what you do is seeing
Al-Mumtahanah,102,0.2144,0.073,0.828,0.099,there ha already been for you an excellent pattern in abraham and those with him when they said to their people indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than allah we have denied you and there ha appeared between u and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in allah alone except for the saying of abraham to his father will surely ask forgiveness for you but have not power to do for you anything against allah our lord upon you we have relied and to you we have returned and to you is the destination
Al-Mumtahanah,28,0.6369,0.0,0.822,0.178,our lord make u not object of torment for the disbeliever and forgive u our lord indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise

Al-Mumtahanah,27,0.6249,0.1,0.655,0.245,perhaps allah will put between you and those to whom you have been enemy among them affection and allah is competent and allah is forgiving and merciful
Al-Mumtahanah,40,0.8674,0.0,0.77,0.23,allah doe not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your home from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them indeed allah love those who act justly
