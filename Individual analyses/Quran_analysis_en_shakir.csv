Al-Anam,33,0.34,0.0,0.93,0.07,then when he saw the moon rising he said is this my lord so when it set he said if my lord had not guided me should certainly be of the erring people
Al-Anam,35,0.8658,0.0,0.767,0.233,then when he saw the sun rising he said is this my lord is this the greatest so when it set he said my people surely am clear of what you set up with allah
Al-Anam,22,0.7351,0.0,0.763,0.237,surely have turned myself being upright wholly to him who originated the heaven and the earth and am not of the polytheist
Al-Anam,52,0.4815,0.085,0.779,0.136,and his people disputed with him he said do you dispute with me respecting allah and he ha guided me indeed and do not fear in any way those that you set up with him unless my lord plea my lord comprehends all thing in his knowledge will you not then mind
Al-Anam,48,0.3818,0.11,0.702,0.188,and how should fear what you have set up with him while you do not fear that you have set up with allah that for which he ha not sent down to you any authority which then of the two party is surer of security if you know
Al-Anam,27,0.6369,0.0,0.828,0.172,those who believe and do not mix up their faith with iniquity those are they who shall have the security and they are those who go aright
Al-Anam,26,0.8176,0.072,0.609,0.319,and this wa our argument which we gave to ibrahim against his people we exalt in dignity whom we please surely your lord is wise knowing
Al-Anam,44,0.765,0.0,0.864,0.136,and we gave to him ishaq and yaqoub each did we guide and nuh did we guide before and of his descendant dawood and sulaiman and ayub and yusuf and musa and haroun and thus do we reward those who do good to others
Al-Anam,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,and zakariya and yahya and isa and ilyas every one wa of the good
Al-Anam,19,0.4588,0.0,0.857,0.143,and ismail and al yasha and yunus and lut and every one we made to excel in the world

Al-Anam,32,0.0516,0.064,0.867,0.069,this is allah guidance he guide thereby whom he plea of his servant and if they had set up others with him certainly what they did would have become ineffectual for them
Al-Anam,34,0.4588,0.057,0.807,0.135,these are they to whom we gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy therefore if these disbelieve in it we have already entrusted with it people who are not disbeliever in it
Al-Anam,28,0.3291,0.0,0.92,0.08,these are they whom allah guided therefore follow their guidance say do not ask you for any reward for it it is nothing but reminder to the nation
Al-Anam,72,-0.1531,0.053,0.915,0.032,and they do not assign to allah the attribute due to him when they say allah ha not revealed anything to mortal say who revealed the book which musa brought light and guidance to men which you make into scattered writing which you show while you conceal much and you were taught what you did not know neither you nor your father say allah then leave them sporting in their vain discourse
Al-Anam,42,0.5423,0.031,0.883,0.086,and this is book we have revealed blessed verifying that which is before it and that you may warn the metropolis and those around her and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they attend to their prayer constantly
Al-Anam,93,0.1813,0.122,0.723,0.155,and who is more unjust than he who forge lie against allah or say it ha been revealed to me while nothing ha been revealed to him and he who say can reveal the like of what allah ha revealed and if you had seen when the unjust shall be in the agony of death and the angel shall spread forth their hand give up your soul today shall you be recompensed with an ignominious chastisement because you spoke against allah other than the truth and because you showed pride against his communication
Al-Anam,66,0.7003,0.057,0.806,0.138,and certainly you have come to u alone a we created you at first and you have left behind your back the thing which we gave you and we do not see with you your intercessor about whom you asserted that they were allah associate in respect to you certainly the tie between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you

Al-Anam,38,-0.2144,0.07,0.881,0.049,and they make the jinni associate with allah while he created them and they falsely attribute to him son and daughter without knowledge glory be to him and highly exalted is he above what they ascribe to him
Al-Anam,31,0.8481,0.056,0.657,0.288,wonderful originator of the heaven and the earth how could he have son when he ha no consort and he himself created everything and he is the knower of all thing
Al-Anam,26,0.4678,0.055,0.786,0.159,that is allah your lord there is no god but he the creator of all thing therefore serve him and he ha charge of all thing

Al-Anam,37,-0.0258,0.067,0.868,0.065,indeed there have come to you clear proof from your lord whoever will therefore see it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind it shall be against himself and am not keeper over you
Al-Anam,26,0.3818,0.0,0.906,0.094,and thus do we repeat the communication and that they may say you have read and that we may make it clear to people who know
Al-Anam,20,-0.0129,0.076,0.851,0.073,follow what is revealed to you from your lord there is no god but he and withdraw from the polytheist
Al-Anam,32,0.4404,0.0,0.914,0.086,and if allah had pleased they would not have set up others with him and we have not appointed you keeper over them and you are not placed in charge of them
Al-Anam,50,0.7605,0.043,0.799,0.157,and do not abuse those whom they call upon besides allah lest exceeding the limit they should abuse allah out of ignorance thus have we made fair seeming to every people their deed then to their lord shall be their return so he will inform them of what they did
Al-Anam,44,0.659,0.025,0.858,0.117,and they swear by allah with the strongest of their oath that if sign came to them they would most certainly believe in it say sign are only with allah and what should make you know that when it come they will not believe
Al-Anam,31,-0.0516,0.04,0.96,0.0,and we will turn their heart and their sight even a they did not believe in it the first time and we will leave them in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
Al-Anam,40,-0.6486,0.122,0.878,0.0,and even if we had sent down to them the angel and the dead had spoken to them and we had brought together all thing before them they would not believe unless allah plea but most of them are ignorant
Al-Anam,47,-0.5423,0.139,0.807,0.054,and thus did we make for every prophet an enemy the shaitan from among men and jinni some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive them and had your lord pleased they would not have done it therefore leave them and that which they forge
Al-Anam,39,-0.1027,0.097,0.793,0.11,and that the heart of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn of evil
Al-Anam,48,0.5719,0.0,0.907,0.093,shall then seek judge other than allah and he it is who ha revealed to you the book which is made plain and those whom we have given the book know that it is revealed by your lord with truth therefore you should not be of the disputers
Al-Anam,27,0.802,0.0,0.745,0.255,and the word of your lord ha been accomplished truly and justly there is none who can change his word and he is the hearing the knowing
Al-Anam,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you obey most of those in the earth they will lead you astray from allah way they follow but conjecture and they only lie
Al-Anam,22,0.9062,0.0,0.627,0.373,surely your lord he best know who go astray from his way and he best know those who follow the right course
Al-Anam,18,0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,therefore eat of that on which allah name ha been mentioned if you are believer in his communication
Al-Anam,65,0.9229,0.089,0.65,0.261,and what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which allah name ha been mentioned and he ha already made plain to you what he ha forbidden to you excepting what you are compelled to and most surely many would lead people astray by their low desire out of ignorance surely your lord he best know those who exceed the limit
Al-Anam,18,-0.802,0.374,0.519,0.107,and abandon open and secret sin surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned
Al-Anam,46,0.9369,0.0,0.709,0.291,and do not eat of that on which allah name ha not been mentioned and that is most surely transgression and most surely the shaitan suggest to their friend that they should contend with you and if you obey them you shall most surely be polytheist
Al-Anam,50,-0.3612,0.11,0.806,0.084,is he who wa dead then we raised him to life and made for him light by which he walk among the people like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth thus what they did wa made fair seeming to the unbeliever
Al-Anam,36,0.1655,0.049,0.884,0.066,and thus have we made in every town the great one to be it guilty one that they may plan therein and they do not plan but against their own soul and they do not perceive
Al-Anam,50,-0.34,0.15,0.74,0.11,and when communication come to them they say we will not believe till we are given the like of what allah apostle are given allah best know where he place his message there shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from allah and severe chastisement because of what they planned
Al-Anam,53,0.1027,0.0,0.973,0.027,therefore for whomsoever allah intends that he would guide him aright he expands his breast for islam and for whomsoever he intends that he should cause him to err he make his breast strait and narrow a though he were ascending upwards thus doe allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe
Al-Anam,21,0.3818,0.0,0.885,0.115,and this is the path of your lord right path indeed we have made the communication clear for people who mind
Al-Anam,20,0.5423,0.0,0.844,0.156,they shall have the abode of peace with their lord and he is their guardian because of what they did
Al-Anam,74,0.9477,0.028,0.739,0.233,and on the day when he shall gather them all together assembly of jinni you took away great part of mankind and their friend from among the men shall say our lord some of u profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which thou didst appoint for u he shall say the fire is your abode to abide in it except a allah is pleased surely your lord is wise knowing
Al-Anam,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thus do we make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned
Al-Anam,58,-0.6486,0.086,0.914,0.0,assembly of jinni and men did there not come to you apostle from among you relating to you my communication and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they shall say we bear witness against ourselves and this world life deceived them and they shall bear witness against their own soul that they were unbeliever
Al-Anam,15,0.431,0.0,0.831,0.169,this is because your lord would not destroy town unjustly while their people were negligent
Al-Anam,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and all have degree according to what they do and your lord is not heedless of what they do
Al-Anam,40,0.5267,0.0,0.894,0.106,and your lord is the self sufficient one the lord of mercy if he plea he may take you off and make whom he plea successor after you even a he raised you up from the seed of another people
Al-Anam,15,-0.1576,0.233,0.618,0.149,surely what you are threatened with must come to pas and you cannot escape it
Al-Anam,37,0.1847,0.14,0.682,0.178,say my people act according to your ability too am acting so you will soon come to know for whom of u will be the good end of the abode surely the unjust shall not be successful
Al-Anam,60,-0.2023,0.067,0.833,0.1,and they set apart portion for allah out of what he ha created of tilth and cattle and say this is for allah so they assert and this for our associate then what is for their associate it reach not to allah and whatever is set apart for allah it reach to their associate evil is that which they judge
Al-Anam,50,-0.1027,0.099,0.81,0.092,and thus their associate have made fair seeming to most of the polytheist the killing of their child that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion and if allah had pleased they would not have done it therefore leave them and that which they forge
Al-Anam,49,-0.128,0.055,0.9,0.045,and they say these are cattle and tilth prohibited none shall eat them except such a we please so they assert and cattle whose back are forbidden and cattle on which they would not mention allah name forging lie against him he shall requite them for what they forged
Al-Anam,48,0.7845,0.05,0.779,0.172,and they say what is in the womb of these cattle is specially for our male and forbidden to our wife and if it be stillborn then they are all partner in it he will reward them for their attributing falsehood to allah surely he is wise knowing
Al-Anam,38,-0.7534,0.208,0.7,0.092,they are lost indeed who kill their child foolishly without knowledge and forbid what allah ha given to them forging lie against allah they have indeed gone astray and they are not the follower of the right course
Al-Anam,64,-0.5682,0.103,0.861,0.036,and he it is who produce garden of vine trellised and untrellised and palm and seed produce of which the fruit are of various sort and olive and pomegranate like and unlike eat of it fruit when it bear fruit and pay the due of it on the day of it reaping and do not act extravagantly surely he doe not love the extravagant
Al-Anam,38,0.34,0.133,0.664,0.203,and of cattle he created beast of burden and those which are fit for slaughter only eat of what allah ha given you and do not follow the footstep of the shaitan surely he is your open enemy
Al-Anam,39,0.3818,0.063,0.814,0.122,eight in pair two of sheep and two of goat say ha he forbidden the two male or the two female or that which the womb of the two female contain inform me with knowledge if you are truthful
Al-Anam,66,-0.8748,0.164,0.805,0.032,and two of camel and two of cow say ha he forbidden the two male or the two female or that which the womb of the two female contain or were you witness when allah enjoined you this who then is more unjust than he who forge lie against allah that he should lead astray men without knowledge surely allah doe not guide the unjust people
Al-Anam,77,0.8338,0.048,0.802,0.15,say do not find in that which ha been revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of except that it be what ha died of itself or blood poured forth or flesh of swine for that surely is unclean or that which is transgression other than the name of allah having been invoked on it but whoever is driven to necessity not desiring nor exceeding the limit then surely your lord is forgiving merciful
Al-Anam,59,0.296,0.073,0.836,0.091,and to those who were jew we made unlawful every animal having claw and of ox and sheep we made unlawful to them the fat of both except such a wa on their back or the entrails or what wa mixed with bone this wa punishment we gave them on account of their rebellion and we are surely truthful
Al-Anam,28,-0.6616,0.219,0.656,0.125,but if they give you the lie then say your lord is the lord of all encompassing mercy and his punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people
Al-Anam,65,-0.7003,0.122,0.838,0.041,those who are polytheist will say if allah had pleased we would not have associated aught with him nor our father nor would we have forbidden to ourselves anything even so did those before them reject until they tasted our punishment say have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it forth to u you only follow conjecture and you only tell lie
Al-Anam,17,0.3535,0.116,0.652,0.231,say then allah is the conclusive argument so if he please he would certainly guide you all
Al-Anam,54,-0.549,0.127,0.804,0.069,say bring your witness who should bear witness that allah ha forbidden this then if they bear witness do not bear witness with them and follow not the low desire of those who reject our communication and of those who do not believe in the hereafter and they make others equal to their lord
Al-Anam,87,0.6414,0.114,0.723,0.163,say come will recite what your lord ha forbidden to you remember that you do not associate anything with him and show kindness to your parent and do not slay your child for fear of poverty we provide for you and for them and do not draw nigh to indecency those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed and do not kill the soul which allah ha forbidden except for the requirement of justice this he ha enjoined you with that you may understand
Al-Anam,69,0.9441,0.0,0.787,0.213,and do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he attains his maturity and give full measure and weight with justice we do not impose on any soul duty except to the extent of it ability and when you speak then be just though it be against relative and fulfill allah covenant this he ha enjoined you with that you may be mindful
Al-Anam,39,-0.4588,0.1,0.845,0.055,and know that this is my path the right one therefore follow it and follow not other way for they will lead you away from his way this he ha enjoined you with that you may guard against evil
Al-Anam,39,0.8225,0.0,0.807,0.193,again we gave the book to musa to complete our blessing on him who would do good to others and making plain all thing and guidance and mercy so that they should believe in the meeting of their lord
Al-Anam,22,0.25,0.148,0.638,0.215,and this is book we have revealed blessed therefore follow it and guard against evil that mercy may be shown to you
Al-Anam,23,0.5859,0.068,0.72,0.212,lest you say that the book wa only revealed to two party before u and we were truly unaware of what they read
Al-Anam,72,0.6213,0.12,0.693,0.187,or lest you should say if the book had been revealed to u we would certainly have been better guided than they so indeed there ha come to you clear proof from your lord and guidance and mercy who then is more unjust than he who reject allah communication and turn away from them we will reward those who turn away from our communication with an evil chastisement because they turned away
Al-Anam,66,0.8458,0.041,0.812,0.147,they do not wait aught but that the angel should come to them or that your lord should come or that some of the sign of your lord should come on the day when some of the sign of your lord shall come it faith shall not profit soul which did not believe before or earn good through it faith say wait we too are waiting
Al-Anam,32,0.1779,0.063,0.855,0.083,surely they who divided their religion into part and became sect you have no concern with them their affair is only with allah then he will inform them of what they did
Al-Anam,34,0.3612,0.104,0.709,0.187,whoever brings good deed he shall have ten like it and whoever brings an evil deed he shall be recompensed only with the like of it and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Al-Anam,32,0.7964,0.0,0.776,0.224,say surely a for me my lord ha guided me to the right path to most right religion the faith of ibrahim the upright one and he wa not of the polytheist
Al-Anam,22,-0.25,0.146,0.746,0.108,say surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are all for allah the lord of the world
Al-Anam,16,0.0516,0.118,0.753,0.129,no associate ha he and this am commanded and am the first of those who submit
Al-Anam,53,-0.93,0.236,0.764,0.0,say what shall seek lord other than allah and he is the lord of all thing and no soul earns evil but against itself and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return so he will inform you of that in which you differed
Al-Anam,50,0.8505,0.07,0.682,0.248,and he it is who ha made you successor in the land and raised some of you above others by various grade that he might try you by what he ha given you surely your lord is quick to requite evil and he is most surely the forgiving the merciful
Al-Araf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,alif lam mim suad
Al-Araf,28,-0.3818,0.122,0.878,0.0,book revealed to you so let there be no straitness in your breast on account of it that you may warn thereby and reminder close to the believer
Al-Araf,22,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,follow what ha been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow guardian besides him how little do you mind
Al-Araf,21,-0.7703,0.26,0.74,0.0,and how many town that we destroyed so our punishment came to it by night or while they slept at midday
Al-Araf,19,-0.5789,0.313,0.546,0.14,yet their cry when our punishment came to them wa nothing but that they said surely we were unjust
Al-Araf,22,0.6582,0.0,0.788,0.212,most certainly then we will question those to whom the apostle were sent and most certainly we will also question the apostle
Al-Araf,15,0.4005,0.0,0.839,0.161,then most certainly we will relate to them with knowledge and we were not absent
Al-Araf,28,0.7717,0.0,0.789,0.211,and the measuring out on that day will be just then a for him whose measure of good deed is heavy those are they who shall be successful
Al-Araf,27,-0.4404,0.183,0.726,0.091,and a for him whose measure of good deed is light those are they who have made their soul suffer loss because they disbelieved in our communication
Al-Araf,25,0.7269,0.0,0.756,0.244,and certainly we have established you in the earth and made in it mean of livelihood for you little it is that you give thanks
Al-Araf,31,0.5267,0.0,0.868,0.132,and certainly we created you then we fashioned you then we said to the angel prostrate to adam so they did prostrate except iblis he wa not of those who prostrated
Al-Araf,33,0.5574,0.062,0.755,0.182,he said what hindered you so that you did not prostrate when commanded you he said am better than he thou hast created me of fire while him thou didst create of dust
Al-Araf,28,0.7579,0.0,0.8,0.2,he said then get forth from this state for it doe not befit you to behave proudly therein go forth therefore surely you are of the abject one
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said respite me until the day when they are raised up
Al-Araf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,he said surely you are of the respited one
Al-Araf,21,0.0516,0.127,0.697,0.176,he said a thou hast caused me to remain disappointed will certainly lie in wait for them in thy straight path
Al-Araf,34,0.9147,0.0,0.702,0.298,then will certainly come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right hand side and from their left hand side and thou shalt not find most of them thankful
Al-Araf,23,-0.7096,0.246,0.673,0.081,he said get out of this state despised driven away whoever of them will follow you will certainly fill hell with you all
Al-Araf,33,-0.5187,0.119,0.799,0.083,and we said adam dwell you and your wife in the garden so eat from where you desire but do not go near this tree for then you will be of the unjust
Al-Araf,55,-0.7651,0.172,0.706,0.121,but the shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them what had been hidden from them of their evil inclination and he said your lord ha not forbidden you this tree except that you may not both become two angel or that you may not become of the immortal
Al-Araf,13,0.7316,0.0,0.641,0.359,and he swore to them both most surely am sincere adviser to you
Al-Araf,61,-0.8732,0.156,0.816,0.028,then he caused them to fall by deceit so when they tasted of the tree their evil inclination became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with the leaf of the garden and their lord called out to them did not forbid you both from that tree and say to you that the shaitan is your open enemy
Al-Araf,29,-0.6497,0.25,0.623,0.127,they said our lord we have been unjust to ourselves and if thou forgive u not and have not mercy on u we shall certainly be of the loser

Al-Araf,38,0.7579,0.0,0.819,0.181,and when they commit an indecency they say we found our father doing this and allah ha enjoined it on u say surely allah doe not enjoin indecency do you say against allah what you do not know

Al-Araf,22,0.4404,0.0,0.879,0.121,deliver to you the message of my lord and offer you good advice and know from allah what you do not know
Al-Araf,39,-0.1585,0.126,0.761,0.113,what do you wonder that reminder ha come to you from your lord through man from among you that he might warn you and that you might guard against evil and so that mercy may be shown to you
Al-Araf,29,-0.9428,0.39,0.526,0.084,but they called him liar so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who rejected our communication surely they were blind people
Al-Araf,28,-0.6705,0.196,0.742,0.062,and to ad we sent their brother hud he said my people serve allah you have no god other than him will you not then guard against evil
Al-Araf,29,0.4742,0.092,0.729,0.179,the chief of those who disbelieved from among his people said most surely we see you in folly and most surely we think you to be of the liar
Al-Araf,20,-0.1531,0.078,0.922,0.0,he said my people there is no folly in me but am an apostle of the lord of the world
Al-Araf,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,deliver to you the message of my lord and am faithful adviser to you
Al-Araf,53,0.9584,0.021,0.674,0.305,what do you wonder that reminder ha come to you from your lord through man from among you that he might warn you and remember when he made you successor after nuh people and increased you in excellence in respect of make therefore remember the benefit of allah that you may be successful
Al-Araf,38,-0.1531,0.116,0.808,0.076,they said have you come to u that we may serve allah alone and give up what our father used to serve then bring to u what you threaten u with if you are of the truthful one
Al-Araf,47,-0.1336,0.078,0.874,0.048,he said indeed uncleanness and wrath from your lord have lighted upon you what do you dispute with me about name which you and your father have given allah ha not sent any authority for them wait then too with you will be of those who wait
Al-Araf,28,-0.4404,0.169,0.752,0.078,so we delivered him and those with him by mercy from u and we cut off the last of those who rejected our communication and were not believer
Al-Araf,63,-0.5719,0.162,0.741,0.097,and to samood we sent their brother salih he said my people serve allah you have no god other than him clear proof indeed ha come to you from your lord this is a allah she camel for you sign therefore leave her alone to pasture on allah earth and do not touch her with any harm otherwise painful chastisement will overtake you
Al-Araf,42,0.34,0.054,0.841,0.106,and remember when he made you successor after ad and settled you in the land you make mansion on it plain and hew out house in the mountain remember therefore allah benefit and do not act corruptly in the land making mischief
Al-Araf,47,0.7184,0.053,0.785,0.162,the chief of those who behaved proudly among his people said to those who were considered weak to those who believed from among them do you know that salih is sent by his lord they said surely we are believer in what he ha been sent with
Al-Araf,14,0.1027,0.144,0.69,0.167,those who were haughty said surely we are denier of what you believe in
Al-Araf,30,-0.4588,0.1,0.9,0.0,so they slew the she camel and revolted against their lord commandment and they said salih bring u what you threatened u with if you are one of the apostle
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the earthquake overtook them so they became motionless body in their abode
Al-Araf,35,0.2378,0.106,0.72,0.174,then he turned away from them and said my people did certainly deliver to you the message of my lord and gave you good advice but you do not love those who give good advice
Al-Araf,27,0.5574,0.0,0.845,0.155,and we sent lut when he said to his people what do you commit an indecency which any one in the world ha not done before you
Al-Araf,16,0.4927,0.0,0.824,0.176,most surely you come to male in lust besides female nay you are an extravagant people
Al-Araf,28,0.1779,0.071,0.836,0.093,and the answer of his people wa no other than that they said turn them out of your town surely they are people who seek to purify themselves
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we delivered him and his follower except his wife she wa of those who remained behind
Al-Araf,15,-0.4215,0.167,0.833,0.0,and we rained upon them rain consider then what wa the end of the guilty
Al-Araf,66,0.8364,0.03,0.807,0.163,and to madyan we sent their brother shu aib he said my people serve allah you have no god other than him clear proof indeed ha come to you from your lord therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their thing and do not make mischief in the land after it reform this is better for you if you are believer
Al-Araf,47,-0.7096,0.116,0.884,0.0,and do not lie in wait in every path threatening and turning away from allah way him who belief in him and seeking to make it crooked and remember when you were few then he multiplied you and consider what wa the end of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,38,0.8625,0.0,0.78,0.22,and if there is party of you who believe in that with which am sent and another party who do not believe then wait patiently until allah judge between u and he is the best of the judge
Al-Araf,45,0.7178,0.05,0.786,0.165,the chief those who were proud from among his people said we will most certainly turn you out shu aib and also those who believe with you from our town or you shall come back to our faith he said what though we dislike it
Al-Araf,70,0.926,0.0,0.81,0.19,indeed we shall have forged lie against allah if we go back to your religion after allah ha delivered u from it and it befits u not that we should go back to it except if allah our lord please our lord comprehends all thing in his knowledge in allah do we trust our lord decide between u and our people with truth and thou art the best of deciders
Al-Araf,24,-0.1206,0.127,0.762,0.111,and the chief of those who disbelieved from among his people said if you follow shu aib you shall then most surely be loser
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the earthquake overtook them so they became motionless body in their abode
Al-Araf,24,-0.875,0.333,0.667,0.0,those who called shu aib liar were a though they had never dwelt therein those who called shu aib liar they were the loser
Al-Araf,33,0.4939,0.083,0.775,0.142,so he turned away from them and said my people certainly delivered to you the message of my lord and gave you good advice how shall then be sorry for an unbelieving people
Al-Araf,24,-0.6808,0.167,0.833,0.0,and we did not send prophet in town but we overtook it people with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves
Al-Araf,35,-0.0516,0.168,0.647,0.185,then we gave them good in the place of evil until they became many and said distress and happiness did indeed befall our father then we took them by surprise while they did not perceive
Al-Araf,40,-0.4939,0.149,0.728,0.124,and if the people of the town had believed and guarded against evil we would certainly have opened up for them blessing from the heaven and the earth but they rejected so we overtook them for what they had earned
Al-Araf,21,-0.2023,0.13,0.772,0.098,what do the people of the town then feel secure from our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep
Al-Araf,21,0.1531,0.123,0.692,0.185,what do the people of the town feel secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they play
Al-Araf,22,0.5859,0.0,0.806,0.194,what do they then feel secure from allah plan but none feel secure from allah plan except the people who shall perish
Al-Araf,38,-0.3786,0.116,0.83,0.055,is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after it former resident that if we please we would afflict them on account of their fault and set seal on their heart so they would not hear
Al-Araf,42,-0.5719,0.13,0.797,0.073,these town we relate to you some of their story and certainly their apostle came to them with clear argument but they would not believe in what they rejected at first thus doe allah set seal over the heart of the unbeliever
Al-Araf,23,0.6486,0.0,0.798,0.202,and we did not find in most of them any faithfulness to covenant and we found most of them to be certainly transgressor
Al-Araf,29,-0.5023,0.104,0.896,0.0,then we raised after them musa with our communication to firon and his chief but they disbelieved in them consider then what wa the end of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,and musa said firon surely am an apostle from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,30,0.7783,0.0,0.776,0.224,am worthy of not saying anything about allah except the truth have come to you indeed with clear proof from your lord therefore send with me the child of israel
Al-Araf,18,0.4588,0.0,0.85,0.15,he said if you have come with sign then bring it if you are of the truthful one
Al-Araf,11,0.3818,0.0,0.794,0.206,so he threw his rod then lo it wa clear serpent
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,and he drew forth his hand and lo it wa white to the beholder
Al-Araf,15,0.4927,0.0,0.814,0.186,the chief of firon people said most surely this is an enchanter possessed of knowledge
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he intends to turn you out of your land what counsel do you then give
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said put him off and his brother and send collector into the city
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that they may bring to you every enchanter possessed of knowledge
Al-Araf,19,0.765,0.0,0.72,0.28,and the enchanter came to firon and said we must surely have reward if we are the prevailing one
Al-Araf,15,0.6249,0.0,0.718,0.282,he said yes and you shall certainly be of those who are near to me
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said musa will you cast or shall we be the first to cast
Al-Araf,20,-0.7003,0.244,0.756,0.0,he said cast so when they cast they deceived the people eye and frightened them and they produced mighty enchantment
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we revealed to musa saying cast your rod then lo it devoured the lie they told
Al-Araf,11,0.3774,0.0,0.795,0.205,so the truth wa established and what they did became null
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus they were vanquished there and they went back abased
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the enchanter were thrown down prostrating themselves
Al-Araf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we believe in the lord of the world
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of musa and haroun
Al-Araf,37,0.2382,0.0,0.949,0.051,firon said do you believe in him before have given you permission surely this is plot which you have secretly devised in this city that you may turn out of it it people but you shall know
Al-Araf,18,0.5423,0.093,0.661,0.247,will certainly cut off your hand and your foot on opposite side then will crucify you all together
Al-Araf,10,0.4404,0.0,0.756,0.244,they said surely to our lord shall we go back
Al-Araf,38,-0.2787,0.101,0.827,0.072,and you do not take revenge on u except because we have believed in the communication of our lord when they came to u our lord pour out upon u patience and cause u to die in submission
Al-Araf,45,0.3182,0.074,0.825,0.101,and the chief of firon people said do you leave musa and his people to make mischief in the land and to forsake you and your god he said we will slay their son and spare their woman and surely we are master over them
Al-Araf,39,0.0516,0.098,0.778,0.124,musa said to his people ask help from allah and be patient surely the land is allah he cause such of his servant to inherit it a he plea and the end is for those who guard against evil
Al-Araf,44,-0.8519,0.193,0.807,0.0,they said we have been persecuted before you came to u and since you have come to u he said it may be that your lord will destroy your enemy and make you ruler in the land then he will see how you act
Al-Araf,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,and certainly we overtook firon people with drought and diminution of fruit that they may be mindful
Al-Araf,45,-0.8573,0.282,0.545,0.172,but when good befell them they said this is due to u and when evil afflicted them they attributed it to the ill luck of musa and those with him surely their evil fortune is only from allah but most of them do not know
Al-Araf,21,0.4019,0.0,0.87,0.13,and they said whatever sign you may bring to u to charm u with it we will not believe in you
Al-Araf,30,-0.7311,0.222,0.727,0.05,therefore we sent upon them widespread death and the locust and the louse and the frog and the blood clear sign but they behaved haughtily and they were guilty people
Al-Araf,47,0.875,0.0,0.765,0.235,and when the plague fell upon them they said musa pray for u to your lord a he ha promised with you if you remove the plague from u we will certainly believe in you and we will certainly send away with you the child of israel
Al-Araf,19,-0.1901,0.156,0.719,0.125,but when we removed the plague from them till term which they should attain lo they broke the promise
Al-Araf,22,-0.802,0.265,0.735,0.0,therefore we inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected our sign and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,57,-0.2247,0.162,0.703,0.135,and we made the people who were deemed weak to inherit the eastern land and the western one which we had blessed and the good word of your lord wa fulfilled in the child of israel because they bore up suffering patiently and we utterly destroyed what firon and his people had wrought and what they built
Al-Araf,44,0.6908,0.053,0.757,0.19,and we made the child of israel to pas the sea then they came upon people who kept to the worship of their idol they said musa make for u god a they have their god he said surely you are people acting ignorantly
Al-Araf,21,0.0258,0.118,0.759,0.122,a to these surely that about which they are shall be brought to naught and that which they do is vain
Al-Araf,20,0.8176,0.0,0.627,0.373,he said what shall seek for you god other than allah while he ha made you excel all created thing
Al-Araf,31,-0.4404,0.179,0.716,0.105,and when we delivered you from firon people who subjected you to severe torment killing your son and sparing your woman and in this there wa great trial from your lord
Al-Araf,52,-0.1027,0.046,0.916,0.038,and we appointed with musa time of thirty night and completed them with ten more so the appointed time of his lord wa complete forty night and musa said to his brother haroun take my place among my people and act well and do not follow the way of the mischief maker
Al-Araf,92,0.8885,0.0,0.905,0.095,and when musa came at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show me thyself so that may look upon thee he said you cannot bear to see me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in it place then will you see me but when his lord manifested his glory to the mountain he made it crumble and musa fell down in swoon then when he recovered he said glory be to thee turn to thee and am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,31,0.7096,0.0,0.831,0.169,he said musa surely have chosen you above the people with my message and with my word therefore take hold of what give to you and be of the grateful one

Al-Araf,66,-0.4404,0.083,0.874,0.043,will turn away from my communication those who are unjustly proud in the earth and if they see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of rectitude they do not take it for way and if they see the way of error they take it for way this is because they rejected our communication and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,28,0.128,0.087,0.809,0.104,and a to those who reject our communication and the meeting of the hereafter their deed are null shall they be rewarded except for what they have done

Al-Araf,31,-0.2523,0.157,0.714,0.129,and when they repented and saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord show not mercy to u and forgive u we shall certainly be of the loser
Al-Araf,85,-0.7682,0.17,0.704,0.126,and when musa returned to his people wrathful and in violent grief he said evil is it that you have done after me did you turn away from the bidding of your lord and he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the head dragging him towards him he said son of my mother surely the people reckoned me weak and had well nigh slain me therefore make not the enemy to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people
Al-Araf,27,0.5574,0.0,0.839,0.161,he said my lord forgive me and my brother and cause u to enter into thy mercy and thou art the most merciful of the merciful one
Al-Araf,32,0.2023,0.088,0.773,0.138,a for those who took the calf for god surely wrath from their lord and disgrace in this world life shall overtake them and thus do we recompense the deviser of lie
Al-Araf,23,0.2433,0.148,0.638,0.214,and a to those who do evil deed then repent after that and believe your lord after that is most surely forgiving merciful

Al-Araf,89,0.8074,0.09,0.742,0.168,those who follow the apostle prophet the ummi whom they find written down with them in the taurat and the injeel who enjoins them good and forbids them evil and make lawful to them the good thing and make unlawful to them impure thing and remove from them their burden and the shackle which were upon them so a for those who believe in him and honor him and help him and follow the light which ha been sent down with him these it is that are the successful
Al-Araf,66,-0.5106,0.094,0.829,0.077,say people surely am the apostle of allah to you all of him whose is the kingdom of the heaven and the earth there is no god but he he brings to life and cause to die therefore believe in allah and his apostle the ummi prophet who belief in allah and his word and follow him so that you may walk in the right way
Al-Araf,18,0.8126,0.0,0.641,0.359,and of musa people wa party who guided people with the truth and thereby did they do justice
Al-Araf,82,-0.5307,0.073,0.882,0.045,and we divided them into twelve tribe a nation and we revealed to musa when his people asked him for water strike the rock with your staff so outnowed from it twelve spring each tribe knew it drinking place and we made the cloud to give shade over them and we sent to them manna and quail eat of the good thing we have given you and they did not do u any harm but they did injustice to their own soul
Al-Araf,50,0.1779,0.104,0.763,0.133,and when it wa said to them reside in this town and eat from it wherever you wish and say put down from u our heavy burden and enter the gate making obeisance we will forgive you your wrong we will give more to those who do good to others
Al-Araf,32,-0.6652,0.21,0.685,0.105,but those who were unjust among them changed it for saying other than that which had been spoken to them so we sent upon them pestilence from heaven because they were unjust
Al-Araf,64,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and ask them about the town which stood by the sea when they exceeded the limit of the sabbath when their fish came to them on the day of their sabbath appearing on the surface of the water and on the day on which they did not keep the sabbath they did not come to them thus did we try them because they transgressed
Al-Araf,31,-0.5267,0.227,0.628,0.145,and when party of them said why do you admonish with severe chastisement they said to be free from blame before your lord and that haply they may guard against evil
Al-Araf,30,-0.9498,0.377,0.623,0.0,so when they neglected what they had been reminded of we delivered those who forbade evil and we overtook those who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed
Al-Araf,21,-0.8658,0.363,0.637,0.0,therefore when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden we said to them be a ape despised and hated
Al-Araf,41,0.5699,0.13,0.652,0.218,and when your lord announced that he would certainly send against them to the day of resurrection those who would subject them to severe torment most surely your lord is quick to requite evil and most surely he is forgiving merciful
Al-Araf,35,0.4939,0.091,0.764,0.145,and we cut them up on the earth into party some of them being righteous and others of them falling short of that and we tried them with blessing and misfortune that they might turn
Al-Araf,88,0.1076,0.115,0.747,0.138,then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the book taking only the frail good of this low life and saying it will be forgiven u and if the like good came to them they would take it too wa not promise taken from them in the book that they would not speak anything about allah but the truth and they have read what is in it and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard against evil do you not then understand
Al-Araf,25,0.3036,0.103,0.718,0.179,and a for those who hold fast by the book and keep up prayer surely we do not waste the reward of the right doer
Al-Araf,51,-0.7003,0.108,0.892,0.0,and when we shook the mountain over them a if it were covering overhead and they thought that it wa going to fall down upon them take hold of what we have given you with firmness and be mindful of what is in it so that you may guard against evil
Al-Araf,50,0.6808,0.0,0.896,0.104,and when your lord brought forth from the child of adam from their back their descendant and made them bear witness against their own soul am not your lord they said yes we bear witness lest you should say on the day of resurrection surely we were heedless of this
Al-Araf,30,-0.743,0.189,0.811,0.0,or you should say only our father associated others with allah before and we were an offspring after them wilt thou then destroy u for what the vain doer did
Al-Araf,14,0.3818,0.0,0.833,0.167,and thus do we make clear the communication and that haply they might return
Al-Araf,33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recite to them the narrative of him to whom we give our communication but he withdraws himself from them so the shaitan overtakes him so he is of those who go astray
Al-Araf,72,-0.7876,0.168,0.747,0.085,and if we had pleased we would certainly have exalted him thereby but he clung to the earth and followed his low desire so his parable is a the parable of the dog if you attack him he lolls out his tongue and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue this is the parable of the people who reject our communication therefore relate the narrative that they may reflect
Al-Araf,18,-0.886,0.409,0.591,0.0,evil is the likeness of the people who reject our communication and are unjust to their own soul
Al-Araf,22,-0.5267,0.139,0.861,0.0,whomsoever allah guide he is the one who follows the right way and whomsoever he cause to err these are the loser
Al-Araf,58,-0.7906,0.156,0.778,0.066,and certainly we have created for hell many of the jinni and the men they have heart with which they do not understand and they have eye with which they do not see and they have ear with which they do not hear they are a cattle nay they are in worse error these are the heedless one
Al-Araf,30,-0.0516,0.175,0.71,0.115,and allah are the best name therefore call on him thereby and leave alone those who violate the sanctity of his name they shall be recompensed for what they did
Al-Araf,19,0.7717,0.0,0.675,0.325,and of those whom we have created are people who guide with the truth and thereby they do justice
Al-Araf,21,-0.7506,0.262,0.738,0.0,and a to those who reject our communication we draw them near to destruction by degree from whence they know not
Al-Araf,9,0.8176,0.0,0.414,0.586,and grant them respite surely my scheme is effective
Al-Araf,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,do they not reflect that their companion ha not unsoundness in mind he is only plain warner
Al-Araf,37,0.6124,0.062,0.76,0.177,do they not consider the kingdom of the heaven and the earth and whatever thing allah ha created and that may be their doom shall have drawn nigh what announcement would they then believe in after this
Al-Araf,22,-0.4939,0.174,0.826,0.0,whomsoever allah cause to err there is no guide for him and he leaf them alone in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
Al-Araf,73,0.6652,0.0,0.941,0.059,they ask you about the hour when will be it taking place say the knowledge of it is only with my lord none but he shall manifest it at it time it will be momentous in the heaven and the earth it will not come on you but of sudden they ask you a if you were solicitous about it say it knowledge is only with allah but most people do not know
Al-Araf,48,0.504,0.143,0.674,0.182,say do not control any benefit or harm for my own soul except a allah please and had known the unseen would have had much of good and no evil would have touched me am nothing but warner and the giver of good news to people who believe
Al-Araf,65,0.9136,0.026,0.777,0.196,he it is who created you from single being and of the same kind did he make his mate that he might incline to her so when he cover her she bear light burden then move about with it but when it grows heavy they both call upon allah their lord if thou givest u good one we shall certainly be of the grateful one
Al-Araf,29,0.7876,0.0,0.795,0.205,but when he give them good one they set up with him associate in what he ha given them but high is allah above what they associate with him
Al-Araf,17,0.048,0.096,0.797,0.106,what they associate with him that which doe not create any thing while they are themselves created
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.118,0.591,0.29,and they have no power to give them help nor can they help themselves
Al-Araf,26,0.296,0.0,0.882,0.118,and if you invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent
Al-Araf,28,0.8126,0.0,0.749,0.251,surely those whom you call on besides allah are in state of subjugation like yourselves therefore call on them then let them answer you if you are truthful

Al-Araf,23,0.1531,0.0,0.932,0.068,and if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking towards you yet they do not see
Al-Araf,12,0.4404,0.13,0.559,0.311,take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant
Al-Araf,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,and if false imputation from the shaitan afflict you seek refuge in allah surely he is hearing knowing

Yunus,25,-0.7003,0.209,0.791,0.0,it is only provision in this world then to u shall be their return then we shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved
Yunus,66,-0.3612,0.086,0.877,0.037,and recite to them the story of nuh when he said to his people my people if my stay and my reminding you by the communication of allah is hard on you yet on allah do rely then resolve upon your affair and gather your associate then let not your affair remain dubious to you then have it executed against me and give me no respite
Yunus,29,0.9022,0.0,0.728,0.272,but if you turn back did not ask for any reward from you my reward is only with allah and am commanded that should be of those who submit
Yunus,37,-0.9578,0.339,0.661,0.0,but they rejected him so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we made them ruler and drowned those who rejected our communication see then what wa the end of the people warned
Yunus,46,-0.6597,0.122,0.843,0.035,then did we raise up after him apostle to their people so they came to them with clear argument but they would not believe in what they had rejected before thus it is that we set seal upon the heart of those who exceed the limit
Yunus,27,-0.1531,0.116,0.786,0.097,then did we send up after them musa and haroun to firon and his chief with our sign but they showed pride and they were guilty people
Yunus,17,0.8241,0.0,0.601,0.399,so when the truth came to them from u they said this is most surely clear enchantment
Yunus,24,0.1601,0.107,0.73,0.163,musa said do you say this of the truth when it ha come to you is it magic and the magician are not successful
Yunus,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said have you come to u to turn u away from what we found our father upon and that greatness in the land should be for you two and we are not going to believe in you
Yunus,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and firon said bring to me every skillful magician
Yunus,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when the magician came musa said to them cast down what you have to cast
Yunus,33,0.1027,0.134,0.721,0.144,so when they cast down musa said to them what you have brought is deception surely allah will make it naught surely allah doe not make the work of mischief maker to thrive
Yunus,21,0.2023,0.11,0.709,0.181,and allah will show the truth to be the truth by his word though the guilty may be averse to it
Yunus,43,0.0333,0.151,0.696,0.153,but none believed in musa except the offspring of his people on account of the fear of firon and their chief lest he should persecute them and most surely firon wa lofty in the land and most surely he wa of the extravagant
Yunus,20,-0.25,0.095,0.905,0.0,and musa said my people if you believe in allah then rely on him alone if you submit to allah
Yunus,20,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,so they said on allah we rely our lord make u not subject to the persecution of the unjust people

Yunus,54,0.128,0.142,0.709,0.149,and musa said our lord surely thou hast given to firon and his chief finery and rich in this world life to this end our lord that they lead people astray from thy way our lord destroy their rich and harden their heart so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment
Yunus,29,0.5423,0.0,0.857,0.143,he said the prayer of you both ha indeed been accepted therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know
Yunus,51,-0.0129,0.031,0.94,0.03,and we made the child of israel to pas through the sea then firon and his host followed them for oppression and tyranny until when drowning overtook him he said believe that there is no god but he in whom the child of israel believe and am of those who submit
Yunus,14,-0.3612,0.161,0.839,0.0,what now and indeed you disobeyed before and you were of the mischief maker
Yunus,32,0.6474,0.0,0.878,0.122,but we will this day deliver you with your body that you may be sign to those after you and most surely the majority of the people are heedless to our communication
Yunus,47,0.745,0.053,0.761,0.186,and certainly we lodged the child of israel in goodly abode and we provided them with good thing but they did not disagree until the knowledge had come to them surely your lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that in which they disagreed
Yunus,40,0.7096,0.069,0.738,0.193,but if you are in doubt a to what we have revealed to you ask those who read the book before you certainly the truth ha come to you from your lord therefore you should not be of the disputers

Yunus,15,0.7964,0.0,0.597,0.403,surely those against whom the word of your lord ha proved true will not believe
Yunus,13,-0.4404,0.195,0.805,0.0,though every sign should come to them until they witness the painful chastisement
Yunus,44,-0.5647,0.09,0.876,0.034,and wherefore wa there not town which should believe so that their belief should have profited them but the people of yunus when they believed we removed from them the chastisement of disgrace in this world life and we gave them provision till time
Yunus,29,0.7003,0.0,0.823,0.177,and if your lord had pleased surely all those who are in the earth would have believed all of them will you then force men till they become believer

Yunus,31,-0.0077,0.15,0.701,0.149,and do not call besides allah on that which can neither benefit you nor harm you for if you do then surely you will in that case be of the unjust
Yunus,48,0.8793,0.039,0.763,0.198,and if allah should afflict you with harm then there is none to remove it but he and if he intends good to you there is none to repel his grace he brings it to whom he plea of his servant and he is the forgiving the merciful

Hud,48,0.3863,0.059,0.796,0.145,and if we hold back from them the punishment until stated period of time they will certainly say what prevents it now surely on the day when it will come to them it shall not be averted from them and that which they scoffed at shall beset them
Hud,21,-0.1548,0.225,0.572,0.203,and if we make man taste mercy from u then take it off from him most surely he is despairing ungrateful
Hud,29,-0.1548,0.24,0.512,0.249,and if we make him taste favor after distress ha afflicted him he will certainly say the evil are gone away from me most surely he is exulting boasting
Hud,15,0.9153,0.0,0.462,0.538,except those who are patient and do good they shall have forgiveness and great reward
Hud,53,0.1311,0.034,0.922,0.043,then it may be that you will give up part of what is revealed to you and your breast will become straitened by it because they say why ha not treasure been sent down upon him or an angel come with him you are only warner and allah is custodian over all thing
Hud,28,0.7845,0.0,0.76,0.24,or do they say he ha forged it say then bring ten forged chapter like it and call upon whom you can besides allah if you are truthful

Hud,18,0.4019,0.0,0.863,0.137,and my people who will help me against allah if drive them away will you not then mind
Hud,62,0.7954,0.073,0.758,0.169,and do not say to you that have the treasure of allah and do not know the unseen nor do say that am an angel nor do say about those whom your eye hold in mean estimation that allah will never grant them any good allah know best what is in their soul for then most surely should be of the unjust
Hud,30,-0.5719,0.235,0.673,0.092,they said nuh indeed you have disputed with u and lengthened dispute with u therefore bring to u what you threaten u with if you are of the truthful one

Hud,36,0.0757,0.091,0.835,0.073,and if intend to give you good advice my advice will not profit you if allah intended that he should leave you to go astray he is your lord and to him shall you be returned
Hud,28,0.0258,0.145,0.708,0.147,or do they say he ha forged it say if have forged it on me is my guilt and am clear of that of which you are guilty
Hud,27,0.2924,0.0,0.923,0.077,and it wa revealed to nuh that none of your people will believe except those who have already believed therefore do not grieve at what they do
Hud,30,-0.296,0.184,0.663,0.153,and make the ark before our eye and according to our revelation and do not speak to me in respect of those who are unjust surely they shall be drowned
Hud,40,0.9493,0.0,0.657,0.343,and he began to make the ark and whenever the chief from among his people passed by him they laughed at him he said if you laugh at u surely we too laugh at you a you laugh at u
Hud,24,-0.4939,0.122,0.878,0.0,so shall you know who it is on whom will come chastisement which will disgrace him and on whom will lasting chastisement come down

Hud,38,0.8074,0.069,0.685,0.246,so when our decree came to pas we delivered salih and those who believed with him by mercy from u and we saved them from the disgrace of that day surely your lord is the strong the mighty
Hud,16,-0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless body in their abode

Hud,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,what remains with allah is better for you if you are believer and am not keeper over you
Hud,40,0.7184,0.0,0.864,0.136,they said shu aib doe your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our father worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property forsooth you are the forbearing the right directing one

Hud,43,0.5402,0.061,0.804,0.135,they said shu aib we do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among u and were it not for your family we would surely stone you and you are not mighty against u
Hud,30,0.4754,0.085,0.741,0.174,he said my people is my family more esteemed by you than allah and you neglect him a thing cast behind your back surely my lord encompasses what you do
Hud,45,-0.6705,0.177,0.729,0.095,and my people act according to your ability too am acting you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is liar and watch surely too am watching with you
Hud,37,-0.2023,0.083,0.854,0.063,and when our decree came to pas we delivered shu aib and those who believed with him by mercy from u and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless body in their abode
Hud,17,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172,a though they had never dwelt in them now surely perdition overtook madyan a had perished samood
Hud,11,0.6486,0.0,0.559,0.441,and certainly we sent musa with our communication and clear authority
Hud,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to firon and his chief but they followed the bidding of firon and firon bidding wa not right directing
Hud,25,-0.7783,0.228,0.772,0.0,he shall lead his people on the resurrection day and bring them down to the fire and evil the place to which they are brought

Hud,43,-0.7638,0.18,0.726,0.094,and we did not do them injustice but they were unjust to themselves so their god whom they called upon besides allah did not avail them aught when the decree of your lord came to pas and they added but to their ruin
Hud,23,-0.9371,0.492,0.43,0.078,and such is the punishment of your lord when he punishes the town while they are unjust surely his punishment is painful severe
Hud,35,-0.0018,0.081,0.838,0.081,most surely there is sign in this for him who fear the chastisement of the hereafter this is day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is day that shall be witnessed

Hud,40,0.743,0.067,0.717,0.216,and certainly we gave the book to musa but it wa gone against and had not word gone forth from your lord the matter would surely have been decided between them and surely they are in disquieting doubt about it

Hud,18,-0.2732,0.15,0.751,0.099,and it did not beseem your lord to have destroyed the town tyrannously while their people acted well
Hud,20,0.6486,0.0,0.773,0.227,and if your lord had pleased he would certainly have made people single nation and they shall continue to differ
Hud,35,0.6808,0.1,0.633,0.266,except those on whom your lord ha mercy and for this did he create them and the word of your lord is fulfilled certainly will fill hell with the jinni and the men all together

Yusuf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,alif lam ra these are the verse of the book that make thing manifest
Yusuf,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,surely we have revealed it an arabic quran that you may understand
Yusuf,28,0.765,0.0,0.798,0.202,we narrate to you the best of narrative by our revealing to you this quran though before this you were certainly one of those who did not know
Yusuf,24,0.4404,0.0,0.888,0.112,when yusuf said to his father my father surely saw eleven star and the sun and the moon saw them making obeisance to me
Yusuf,27,-0.327,0.163,0.747,0.09,he said my son do not relate your vision to your brother lest they devise plan against you surely the shaitan is an open enemy to man
Yusuf,45,0.8271,0.0,0.825,0.175,and thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of saying and make his favor complete to you and to the child of yaqoub a he made it complete before to your father ibrahim and ishaq surely your lord is knowing wise
Yusuf,12,0.34,0.0,0.821,0.179,certainly in yusuf and his brother there are sign for the inquirer
Yusuf,28,0.8122,0.073,0.625,0.301,when they said certainly yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are stronger company most surely our father is in manifest error
Yusuf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,slay yusuf or cast him forth into some land so that your father regard may be exclusively for you and after that you may be righteous people
Yusuf,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,speaker from among them said do not slay yusuf and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do it so that some of the traveller may pick him up
Yusuf,28,0.8121,0.075,0.615,0.31,they said our father what reason have you that you do not trust in u with respect to yusuf and most surely we are his sincere well wishers
Yusuf,19,0.802,0.0,0.647,0.353,send him with u tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport and surely we will guard him well
Yusuf,25,-0.5423,0.204,0.703,0.093,he said surely it grief me that you should take him off and fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him
Yusuf,21,0.6369,0.117,0.586,0.297,they said surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are strong company we should then certainly be loser
Yusuf,42,0.5849,0.0,0.893,0.107,so when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit and we revealed to him you will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive
Yusuf,9,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,and they came to their father at nightfall weeping
Yusuf,30,0.8316,0.0,0.747,0.253,they said our father surely we went off racing and left yusuf by our good so the wolf devoured him and you will not believe u though we are truthful
Yusuf,39,0.8151,0.0,0.81,0.19,and they brought his shirt with false blood upon it he said nay your soul have made the matter light for you but patience is good and allah is he whose help is sought for against what you describe
Yusuf,38,0.4404,0.0,0.925,0.075,and there came traveller and they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket he said good news this is youth and they concealed him a an article of merchandise and allah knew what they did
Yusuf,18,0.128,0.105,0.766,0.129,and they sold him for small price few piece of silver and they showed no desire for him
Yusuf,62,0.5499,0.0,0.911,0.089,and the egyptian who bought him said to his wife give him an honorable abode maybe he will be useful to u or we may adopt him a son and thus did we establish yusuf in the land and that we might teach him the interpretation of saying and allah is the master of his affair but most people do not know
Yusuf,22,0.875,0.0,0.655,0.345,and when he had attained his maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge and thus do we reward those who do good
Yusuf,42,0.6597,0.066,0.76,0.174,and she in whose house he wa sought to make himself yield to her and she made fast the door and said come forward he said seek allah refuge surely my lord made good my abode surely the unjust do not prosper
Yusuf,47,0.3818,0.079,0.776,0.144,and certainly she made for him and he would have made for her were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his lord thus it wa that we might turn away from him evil and indecency surely he wa one of our sincere servant
Yusuf,41,-0.8885,0.216,0.784,0.0,and they both hastened to the door and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door she said what is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or painful chastisement
Yusuf,36,-0.4588,0.131,0.813,0.057,he said she sought to make me yield to her and witness of her own family bore witness if his shirt is rent from front she speaks the truth and he is one of the liar
Yusuf,18,0.4588,0.0,0.85,0.15,and if his shirt is rent from behind she tell lie and he is one of the truthful
Yusuf,23,0.872,0.0,0.669,0.331,so when he saw his shirt rent from behind he said surely it is guile of you woman surely your guile is great
Yusuf,21,-0.2023,0.209,0.612,0.18,yusuf turn aside from this and my wife ask forgiveness for your fault surely you are one of the wrong doer
Yusuf,34,0.8542,0.096,0.623,0.282,and woman in the city said the chief wife seek her slave to yield himself to her surely he ha affected her deeply with his love most surely we see her in manifest error
Yusuf,62,0.8689,0.022,0.801,0.177,so when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them repast and gave each of them knife and said to yusuf come forth to them so when they saw him they deemed him great and cut their hand in amazement and said remote is allah from imperfection this is not mortal this is but noble angel
Yusuf,50,0.4404,0.101,0.733,0.166,she said this is he with respect to whom you blamed me and certainly sought his yielding himself to me but he abstained and if he doe not do what bid him he shall certainly be imprisoned and he shall certainly be of those who are in state of ignominy
Yusuf,38,-0.2263,0.123,0.774,0.103,he said my lord the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me and if thou turn not away their device from me will yearn towards them and become one of the ignorant
Yusuf,20,0.6124,0.0,0.783,0.217,thereupon his lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him surely he is the hearing the knowing
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then it occurred to them after they had seen the sign that they should imprison him till time
Yusuf,47,0.3612,0.063,0.825,0.111,and two youth entered the prison with him one of them said saw myself pressing wine and the other said saw myself carrying bread on my head of which bird ate inform u of it interpretation surely we see you to be of the doer of good
Yusuf,57,0.5719,0.051,0.841,0.108,he said there shall not come to you the food with which you are fed but will inform you both of it interpretation before it come to you this is of what my lord ha taught me surely have forsaken the religion of people who do not believe in allah and they are denier of the hereafter
Yusuf,40,-0.298,0.076,0.878,0.046,and follow the religion of my father ibrahim and ishaq and yaqoub it beseems u not that we should associate aught with allah this is by allah grace upon u and on mankind but most people do not give thanks
Yusuf,16,0.4939,0.145,0.57,0.285,my two mate of the prison are sundry lord better or allah the one the supreme
Yusuf,51,0.7684,0.0,0.863,0.137,you do not serve besides him but name which you have named you and your father allah ha not sent down any authority for them judgment is only allah he ha commanded that you shall not serve aught but him this is the right religion but most people do not know
Yusuf,45,-0.4939,0.073,0.903,0.024,my two mate of the prison a for one of you he shall give his lord to drink wine and a for the other he shall be crucified so that the bird shall eat from his head the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired
Yusuf,39,-0.7783,0.155,0.845,0.0,and he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two remember me with your lord but the shaitan caused him to forget mentioning it to his lord so he remained in the prison few year
Yusuf,34,0.7096,0.0,0.818,0.182,and the king said surely see seven fat kine which seven lean one devoured and seven green ear and seven others dry chief explain to me my dream if you can interpret the dream
Yusuf,13,0.1779,0.141,0.613,0.245,they said confused dream and we do not know the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,26,-0.5423,0.123,0.877,0.0,and of the two prisoner he who had found deliverance and remembered after long time said will inform you of it interpretation so let me go
Yusuf,34,0.4588,0.0,0.914,0.086,yusuf truthful one explain to u seven fat kine which seven lean one devoured and seven green ear and seven others dry that may go back to the people so that they may know
Yusuf,24,-0.0516,0.05,0.95,0.0,he said you shall sow for seven year continuously then what you reap leave it in it ear except little of which you eat
Yusuf,33,-0.3182,0.067,0.933,0.0,then there shall come after that seven year of hardship which shall eat away all that you have beforehand laid up in store for them except little of what you shall have preserved
Yusuf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then there will come after that year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall press grape
Yusuf,42,0.6124,0.044,0.826,0.129,and the king said bring him to me so when the messenger came to him he said go back to your lord and ask him what is the case of the woman who cut their hand surely my lord know their guile
Yusuf,56,0.5095,0.098,0.741,0.161,he said how wa your affair when you sought yusuf to yield himself to you they said remote is allah from imperfection we knew of no evil on his part the chief wife said now ha the truth become established sought him to yield himself to me and he is most surely of the truthful one
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this is that he might know that have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that allah doe not guide the device of the unfaithful
Yusuf,33,0.7256,0.153,0.54,0.306,and do not declare myself free most surely man self is wont to command him to do evil except such a my lord ha had mercy on surely my lord is forgiving merciful
Yusuf,33,0.8519,0.0,0.763,0.237,and the king said bring him to me will choose him for myself so when he had spoken with him he said surely you are in our presence today an honorable faithful one
Yusuf,18,0.8555,0.0,0.533,0.467,he said place me in authority over the treasure of the land surely am good keeper knowing well
Yusuf,40,0.8331,0.06,0.682,0.258,and thus did we give to yusuf power in the land he had mastery in it wherever he liked we send down our mercy on whom we please and we do not waste the reward of those who do good
Yusuf,18,0.5574,0.161,0.511,0.328,and certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and guard against evil
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and yusuf brother came and went in to him and he knew them while they did not recognize him
Yusuf,34,0.6369,0.0,0.887,0.113,and when he furnished them with their provision he said bring to me brother of yours from your father do you not see that give full measure and that am the best of host
Yusuf,24,-0.4215,0.109,0.891,0.0,but if you do not bring him to me you shall have no measure of corn from me nor shall you come near me
Yusuf,21,0.6597,0.0,0.779,0.221,they said we will strive to make his father yield in respect of him and we are sure to do it
Yusuf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he said to his servant put their money into their bag that they may recognize it when they go back to their family so that they may come back
Yusuf,37,0.4927,0.0,0.914,0.086,so when they returned to their father they said our father the measure is withheld from u therefore send with u our brother so that we may get the measure and we will most surely guard him
Yusuf,37,0.8779,0.041,0.692,0.267,he said cannot trust in you with respect to him except a trusted in you with respect to his brother before but allah is the best keeper and he is the most merciful of the merciful one
Yusuf,56,0.83,0.0,0.856,0.144,and when they opened their good they found their money returned to them they said our father what more can we desire this is our property returned to u and we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother and will have in addition the measure of camel load this is an easy measure
Yusuf,57,0.5849,0.036,0.866,0.098,he said will by no mean send him with you until you give me firm covenant in allah name that you will most certainly bring him back to me unless you are completely surrounded and when they gave him their covenant he said allah is the one in whom trust is placed a regard what we say
Yusuf,41,0.128,0.0,0.964,0.036,and he said my son do not all enter by one gate and enter by different gate and cannot avail you aught against allah judgment is only allah on him do rely and on him let those who are reliant rely
Yusuf,51,0.9022,0.0,0.809,0.191,and when they had entered a their father had bidden them it did not avail them aught against allah but it wa only desire in the soul of yaqoub which he satisfied and surely he wa possessed of knowledge because we had given him knowledge but most people do not know
Yusuf,24,-0.3818,0.102,0.898,0.0,and when they went in to yusuf he lodged his brother with himself saying am your brother therefore grieve not at what they do
Yusuf,27,-0.4741,0.188,0.717,0.095,so when he furnished them with their provision someone placed the drinking cup in his brother bag then crier cried out caravan you are most surely thief
Yusuf,13,-0.1531,0.118,0.882,0.0,they said while they were facing them what is it that you miss
Yusuf,23,0.1779,0.064,0.843,0.092,they said we miss the king drinking cup and he who shall bring it shall have camel load and am responsible for it
Yusuf,24,0.3348,0.088,0.74,0.172,they said by allah you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land and we are not thief
Yusuf,14,-0.6652,0.255,0.745,0.0,they said but what shall be the requital of this if you are liar
Yusuf,30,-0.128,0.099,0.816,0.085,they said the requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be held for the satisfaction thereof thus do we punish the wrongdoer
Yusuf,67,0.6369,0.0,0.926,0.074,so he began with their sack before the sack of his brother then he brought it out from his brother sack thus did we plan for the sake of yusuf it wa not lawful that he should take his brother under the king law unless allah pleased we raise the degree of whomsoever we please and above every one possessed of knowledge is the all knowing one
Yusuf,42,-0.5423,0.19,0.702,0.107,they said if he steal brother of his did indeed steal before but yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them he said you are in an evil condition and allah know best what you state
Yusuf,28,0.802,0.0,0.745,0.255,they said chief he ha father very old man therefore retain one of u in his stead surely we see you to be of the doer of good
Yusuf,26,0.3597,0.106,0.708,0.186,he said allah protect u that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property for then most surely we would be unjust
Yusuf,70,0.34,0.074,0.833,0.092,then when they despaired of him they retired conferring privately together the eldest of them said do you not know that your father took from you covenant in allah name and how you fell short of your duty with respect to yusuf before therefore will by no mean depart from this land until my father permit me or allah decides for me and he is the best of the judge
Yusuf,35,0.6124,0.0,0.868,0.132,go back to your father and say our father surely your son committed theft and we do not bear witness except to what we have known and we could not keep watch over the unseen
Yusuf,22,0.7346,0.0,0.764,0.236,and inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded and most surely we are truthful
Yusuf,32,0.8505,0.0,0.732,0.268,he yaqoub said nay your soul have made matter light for you so patience is good maybe allah will bring them all together to me surely he is the knowing the wise
Yusuf,28,-0.9042,0.337,0.663,0.0,and he turned away from them and said my sorrow for yusuf and his eye became white on account of the grief and he wa repressor of grief
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said by allah you will not cease to remember yusuf until you are prey to constant disease or until you are of those who perish
Yusuf,20,-0.8442,0.349,0.651,0.0,he said only complain of my grief and sorrow to allah and know from allah what you do not know
Yusuf,26,-0.3653,0.297,0.532,0.171,my son go and inquire respecting yusuf and his brother and despair not of allah mercy surely none despair of allah mercy except the unbelieving people

Yusuf,12,0.1263,0.17,0.629,0.201,they said by allah you are most surely in your old error
Yusuf,36,0.4404,0.0,0.923,0.077,so when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his face so forthwith he regained his sight he said did not say to you that know from allah what you do not know

Yusuf,87,0.9612,0.031,0.733,0.236,and he raised his parent upon the throne and they fell down in prostration before him and he said my father this is the significance of my vision of old my lord ha indeed made it to be true and he wa indeed kind to me when he brought me forth from the prison and brought you from the desert after the shaitan had sown dissension between me and my brother surely my lord is benignant to whom he plea surely he is the knowing the wise

Yusuf,31,0.1779,0.0,0.946,0.054,this is of the announcement relating to the unseen which we reveal to you and you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair and they were devising plan
Yusuf,11,0.6486,0.0,0.629,0.371,and most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly
Yusuf,18,0.3291,0.0,0.879,0.121,and you do not ask them for reward for this it is nothing but reminder for all mankind
Yusuf,20,0.5106,0.0,0.852,0.148,and how many sign in the heaven and the earth which they pas by yet they turn aside from it

Yusuf,30,0.34,0.0,0.924,0.076,do they then feel secure that there may come to them an extensive chastisement from allah or that the hour may come to them suddenly while they do not perceive

Yusuf,37,-0.3773,0.199,0.614,0.187,until when the apostle despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told lie our help came to them and whom we pleased wa delivered and our punishment is not averted from the guilty people
Yusuf,40,0.6059,0.0,0.885,0.115,in their history there is certainly lesson for men of understanding it is not narrative which could be forged but verification of what is before it and distinct explanation of all thing and guide and mercy to people who believe

Ar-Rad,98,0.7615,0.059,0.805,0.136,and even if there were quran with which the mountain were made to pas away or the earth were travelled over with it or the dead were made to speak thereby nay the commandment is wholly allah have not yet those who believe known that if allah please he would certainly guide all the people and a for those who disbelieve there will not cease to afflict them because of what they do repelling calamity or it will alight close by their abode until the promise of allah come about surely allah will not fail in his promise

Ibrahim,42,0.8271,0.0,0.839,0.161,and we did not send any apostle but with the language of his people so that he might explain to them clearly then allah make whom he plea err and he guide whom he plea and he is the mighty the wise

Ibrahim,27,0.4019,0.156,0.613,0.231,and when your lord made it known if you are grateful would certainly give to you more and if you are ungrateful my chastisement is truly severe
Ibrahim,21,0.5256,0.11,0.657,0.233,and musa said if you are ungrateful you and those on earth all together most surely allah is self sufficient praised

Ibrahim,60,0.8375,0.09,0.677,0.233,their apostle said is there doubt about allah the maker of the heaven and the earth he invite you to forgive you your fault and to respite you till an appointed term they said you are nothing but mortal like u you wish to turn u away from what our father used to worship bring u therefore some clear authority
Ibrahim,48,0.3259,0.052,0.852,0.097,their apostle said to them we are nothing but mortal like yourselves but allah bestows his favor on whom he plea of his servant and it is not for u that we should bring you an authority except by allah permission and on allah should the believer rely
Ibrahim,39,0.6486,0.0,0.844,0.156,and what reason have we that we should not rely on allah and he ha indeed guided u in our way and certainly we would bear with patience your persecution of u and on allah should the reliant rely
Ibrahim,40,-0.343,0.141,0.747,0.112,and those who disbelieved said to their apostle we will most certainly drive you forth from our land or else you shall come back into our religion so their lord revealed to them most certainly we will destroy the unjust

Al-Hijr,16,0.3848,0.138,0.603,0.259,and they say you to whom the reminder ha been revealed you are most surely insane
Al-Hijr,16,0.4588,0.0,0.824,0.176,why do you not bring to u the angel if you are of the truthful one
Al-Hijr,16,0.4497,0.0,0.836,0.164,we do not send the angel but with truth and then they would not be respited
Al-Hijr,14,0.7003,0.0,0.674,0.326,surely we have revealed the reminder and we will most surely be it guardian
Al-Hijr,12,0.34,0.0,0.821,0.179,and certainly we sent apostle before you among the nation of yore
Al-Hijr,12,-0.4497,0.211,0.789,0.0,and there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him
Al-Hijr,13,-0.4215,0.189,0.811,0.0,thus do we make it to enter into the heart of the guilty
Al-Hijr,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,they do not believe in it and indeed the example of the former people ha already passed
Al-Hijr,19,0.5106,0.0,0.845,0.155,and even if we open to them gateway of heaven so that they ascend into it all the while
Al-Hijr,17,0.6124,0.0,0.75,0.25,they would certainly say only our eye have been covered over rather we are an enchanted people
Al-Hijr,19,0.8176,0.0,0.612,0.388,and certainly we have made stronghold in the heaven and we have made it fair seeming to the beholder
Al-Hijr,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we guard it against every accursed shaitan
Al-Hijr,11,-0.6486,0.301,0.699,0.0,but he who steal hearing so there follows him visible flame
Al-Hijr,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the earth we have spread it forth and made in it firm mountain and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing
Al-Hijr,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have made in it mean of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not the supplier

Al-Hijr,17,0.5267,0.0,0.773,0.227,and certainly we created man of clay that give forth sound of black mud fashioned in shape
Al-Hijr,10,-0.1725,0.211,0.631,0.158,and the jinni we created before of intensely hot fire
Al-Hijr,23,0.6124,0.0,0.808,0.192,and when your lord said to the angel surely am going to create mortal of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape
Al-Hijr,19,0.1779,0.0,0.914,0.086,so when have made him complete and breathed into him of my spirit fall down making obeisance to him
Al-Hijr,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the angel made obeisance all of them together
Al-Hijr,14,0.3252,0.0,0.848,0.152,but iblis did it not he refused to be with those who made obeisance
Al-Hijr,16,0.0772,0.0,0.92,0.08,he said iblis what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance
Al-Hijr,24,0.25,0.0,0.92,0.08,he said am not such that should make obeisance to mortal whom thou hast created of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape
Al-Hijr,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,he said then get out of it for surely you are driven away
Al-Hijr,11,-0.1531,0.227,0.584,0.188,and surely on you is curse until the day of judgment
Al-Hijr,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said my lord then respite me till the time when they are raised

Al-Hijr,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and inform them of the guest of ibrahim
Al-Hijr,16,0.7506,0.0,0.686,0.314,when they entered upon him they said peace he said surely we are afraid of you
Al-Hijr,16,0.1265,0.125,0.725,0.15,they said be not afraid surely we give you the good news of boy possessing knowledge
Al-Hijr,26,0.802,0.0,0.737,0.263,he said do you give me good news of son when old age ha come upon me of what then do you give me good news

Al-Hijr,15,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172,except his wife we ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind
Al-Hijr,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so when the apostle came to lut follower
Al-Hijr,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,he said surely you are an unknown people
Al-Hijr,14,-0.34,0.156,0.844,0.0,they said nay we have come to you with that about which they disputed
Al-Hijr,15,0.8304,0.0,0.578,0.422,and we have come to you with the truth and we are most surely truthful
Al-Hijr,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore go forth with your follower in part of the night and yourself follow their rear and let not any one of you turn round and go forth whither you are commanded
Al-Hijr,19,-0.2732,0.104,0.896,0.0,and we revealed to him this decree that the root of these shall be cut off in the morning
Al-Hijr,8,0.5859,0.0,0.648,0.352,and the people of the town came rejoicing
Al-Hijr,12,0.6734,0.0,0.644,0.356,he said surely these are my guest therefore do not disgrace me
Al-Hijr,14,-0.743,0.344,0.656,0.0,and guard against the punishment of allah and do not put me to shame
Al-Hijr,10,0.3252,0.0,0.794,0.206,they said have we not forbidden you from other people
Al-Hijr,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said these are my daughter if you will do aught
Al-Hijr,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,by your life they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication
Al-Hijr,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the rumbling overtook them while entering upon the time of sunrise
Al-Hijr,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus did we turn it upside down and rained down upon them stone of what had been decreed
Al-Hijr,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,surely in this are sign for those who examine
Al-Hijr,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,and surely it is on road that still abides
Al-Hijr,10,0.4927,0.0,0.738,0.262,most surely there is sign in this for the believer
Al-Hijr,11,-0.022,0.223,0.498,0.28,and the dweller of the thicket also were most surely unjust
Al-Hijr,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we inflicted retribution on them and they are both indeed on an open road still pursued
Al-Hijr,10,-0.1531,0.236,0.5,0.264,and the dweller of the rock certainly rejected the apostle
Al-Hijr,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we gave them our communication but they turned aside from them
Al-Hijr,9,0.34,0.0,0.769,0.231,and they hewed house in the mountain in security
Al-Hijr,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the rumbling overtook them in the morning
Al-Hijr,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and what they earned did not avail them
Al-Hijr,32,0.9175,0.075,0.598,0.327,and we did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them two but in truth and the hour is most surely coming so turn away with kindly forgiveness
Al-Hijr,11,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,surely your lord is the creator of all thing the knowing
Al-Hijr,16,0.6597,0.0,0.722,0.278,and certainly we have given you seven of the oft repeated verse and the grand quran
Al-Hijr,29,0.8602,0.0,0.675,0.325,do not strain your eye after what we have given certain class of them to enjoy and do not grieve for them and make yourself gentle to the believer
Al-Hijr,7,0.4404,0.0,0.674,0.326,and say surely am the plain warner
Al-Hijr,8,0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294,like a we sent down on the divider
Al-Hijr,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those who made the quran into shred
Al-Hijr,11,0.4005,0.0,0.788,0.212,so by your lord we would most certainly question them all
Al-Hijr,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a to what they did
Al-Hijr,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheist
Al-Hijr,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,surely we will suffice you against the scoffer
Al-Hijr,13,0.2732,0.0,0.851,0.149,those who set up another god with allah so they shall soon know
Al-Hijr,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,and surely we know that your breast straitens at what they say
Al-Hijr,14,0.8074,0.0,0.622,0.378,therefore celebrate the praise of your lord and be of those who make obeisance
Al-Hijr,13,0.2732,0.0,0.851,0.149,and serve your lord until there come to you that which is certain
An-Nahl,26,0.5635,0.072,0.738,0.189,allah commandment ha come therefore do not desire to hasten it glory be to him and highly exalted be he above what they associate with him
An-Nahl,37,0.3291,0.081,0.781,0.138,he sends down the angel with the inspiration by his commandment on whom he plea of his servant saying give the warning that there is no god but me therefore be careful of your duty to me
An-Nahl,20,0.765,0.0,0.691,0.309,he created the heaven and the earth with the truth highly exalted be he above what they associate with him
An-Nahl,13,0.3612,0.0,0.759,0.241,he created man from small seed and lo he is an open contender
An-Nahl,22,0.5994,0.0,0.763,0.237,and he created the cattle for you you have in them warm clothing and many advantage and of them do you eat
An-Nahl,23,0.5859,0.0,0.853,0.147,and there is beauty in them for you when you drive them back to home and when you send them forth to pasture
An-Nahl,26,0.6063,0.156,0.607,0.237,and they carry your heavy load to region which you could not reach but with distress of the soul most surely your lord is compassionate merciful
An-Nahl,26,-0.34,0.122,0.804,0.073,and he made horse and mule and ass that you might ride upon them and a an ornament and he creates what you do not know
An-Nahl,27,0.5719,0.0,0.842,0.158,and upon allah it rest to show the right way and there are some deviating way and if he please he would certainly guide you all aright
An-Nahl,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he it is who sends down water from the cloud for you it give drink and by it grow the tree upon which you pasture
An-Nahl,34,0.4927,0.0,0.912,0.088,he cause to grow for you thereby herbage and the olive and the palm tree and the grape and of all the fruit most surely there is sign in this for people who reflect
An-Nahl,38,0.6801,0.0,0.866,0.134,and he ha made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the star are made subservient by his commandment most surely there are sign in this for people who ponder
An-Nahl,23,0.7645,0.0,0.725,0.275,and what he ha created in the earth of varied hue most surely there is sign in this for people who are mindful
An-Nahl,49,0.765,0.0,0.858,0.142,and he it is who ha made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it ornament which you wear and you see the ship cleaving through it and that you might seek of his bounty and that you may give thanks
An-Nahl,25,0.7579,0.0,0.78,0.22,and he ha cast great mountain in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you and river and road that you may go aright
An-Nahl,11,0.0772,0.0,0.885,0.115,and landmark and by the star they find the right way
An-Nahl,16,0.4188,0.093,0.67,0.237,is he then who creates like him who doe not create do you not then mind
An-Nahl,21,0.8439,0.0,0.627,0.373,and if you would count allah favor you will not be able to number them most surely allah is forgiving merciful
An-Nahl,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and allah know what you conceal and what you do openly
An-Nahl,17,-0.357,0.188,0.812,0.0,and those whom they call on besides allah have not created anything while they are themselves created
An-Nahl,14,-0.6486,0.249,0.751,0.0,dead are they not living and they know not when they shall be raised
An-Nahl,24,0.25,0.08,0.802,0.118,your allah is one allah so a for those who do not believe in the hereafter their heart are ignorant and they are proud
An-Nahl,17,-0.2076,0.3,0.472,0.228,truly allah know what they hide and what they manifest surely he doe not love the proud
An-Nahl,21,0.34,0.0,0.893,0.107,and when it is said to them what is it that your lord ha revealed they say story of the ancient
An-Nahl,32,-0.9119,0.31,0.69,0.0,that they may bear their burden entirely on the day of resurrection and also of the burden of those whom they lead astray without knowledge now surely evil is what they bear
An-Nahl,37,-0.6486,0.107,0.893,0.0,those before them did indeed devise plan but allah demolished their building from the foundation so the roof fell down on them from above them and the punishment came to them from whence they did not perceive
An-Nahl,46,-0.8885,0.234,0.716,0.051,then on the resurrection day he will bring them to disgrace and say where are the associate you gave me for whose sake you became hostile those who are given the knowledge will say surely the disgrace and the evil are this day upon the unbeliever
An-Nahl,32,-0.8658,0.273,0.659,0.068,those whom the angel cause to die while they are unjust to themselves then would they offer submission we used not to do any evil aye surely allah know what you did
An-Nahl,19,-0.6075,0.303,0.458,0.239,therefore enter the gate of hell to abide therein so certainly evil is the dwelling place of the proud
An-Nahl,53,0.8999,0.118,0.576,0.306,and it is said to those who guard against evil what is it that your lord ha revealed they say good for those who do good in this world is good and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better and certainly most excellent is the abode of those who guard against evil
An-Nahl,29,0.1531,0.121,0.714,0.165,the garden of perpetuity they shall enter them river flowing beneath them they shall have in them what they please thus doe allah reward those who guard against evil
An-Nahl,22,0.3612,0.133,0.648,0.218,those whom the angel cause to die in good state saying peace be on you enter the garden for what you did
An-Nahl,42,0.7967,0.0,0.849,0.151,they do not wait aught but that the angel should come to them or that the commandment of your lord should come to pas thus did those before them and allah wa not unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
An-Nahl,19,-0.7893,0.291,0.709,0.0,so the evil consequence of what they did shall afflict them and that which they mocked shall encompass them
An-Nahl,53,0.4404,0.0,0.947,0.053,and they who give associate to allah say if allah had pleased we would not have served anything besides allah neither we nor our father nor would we have prohibited anything without order from him thus did those before them is then aught incumbent upon the apostle except plain delivery of the message
An-Nahl,48,-0.4767,0.104,0.851,0.045,and certainly we raised in every nation an apostle saying serve allah and shun the shaitan so there were some of them whom allah guided and there were others against whom error wa due therefore travel in the land then see what wa the end of the rejecters
An-Nahl,22,0.7906,0.0,0.704,0.296,if you desire for their guidance yet surely allah doe not guide him who lead astray nor shall they have any helper
An-Nahl,35,0.5709,0.029,0.818,0.153,and they swear by allah with the most energetic of their oath allah will not raise up him who dy yea it is promise binding on him quite true but most people do not know
An-Nahl,24,-0.6705,0.2,0.8,0.0,so that he might make manifest to them that about which they differ and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liar
An-Nahl,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,our word for thing when we intend it is only that we say to it be and it is
An-Nahl,36,0.6901,0.049,0.718,0.233,and those who fly for allah sake after they are oppressed we will most certainly give them good abode in the world and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much greater did they but know
An-Nahl,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those who are patient and on their lord do they rely
An-Nahl,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we did not send before you any but men to whom we sent revelation so ask the follower of the reminder if you do not know
An-Nahl,32,0.6249,0.066,0.735,0.199,with clear argument and scripture and we have revealed to you the reminder that you may make clear to men what ha been revealed to them and that haply they may reflect
An-Nahl,34,-0.7351,0.185,0.756,0.059,do they then who plan evil deed feel secure of this that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive
An-Nahl,18,-0.1326,0.082,0.918,0.0,or that he may not seize them in the course of their journey then shall they not escape
An-Nahl,22,0.2195,0.19,0.591,0.219,or that he may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss for your lord is most surely compassionate merciful
An-Nahl,28,0.5267,0.0,0.855,0.145,do they not consider every thing that allah ha created it very shadow return from right and left making obeisance to allah while they are in utter abasement
An-Nahl,29,0.3103,0.063,0.835,0.102,and whatever creature that is in the heaven and that is in the earth make obeisance to allah only and the angel too and they do not show pride
An-Nahl,12,-0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,they fear their lord above them and do what they are commanded
An-Nahl,21,-0.1724,0.167,0.735,0.098,and allah ha said take not two god he is only one allah so of me alone should you be afraid
An-Nahl,30,0.0258,0.093,0.812,0.096,and whatever is in the heaven and the earth is his and to him should obedience be rendered constantly will you then guard against other than the punishment of allah
An-Nahl,23,-0.7003,0.248,0.662,0.089,and whatever favor is bestowed on you it is from allah then when evil afflicts you to him do you cry for aid
An-Nahl,17,-0.4019,0.199,0.679,0.122,yet when he remove the evil from you lo party of you associate others with their lord
An-Nahl,19,0.0516,0.129,0.733,0.138,so that they be ungrateful for what we have given them then enjoy yourselves for soon will you know
An-Nahl,30,0.2568,0.051,0.865,0.083,and they set apart for what they do not know portion of what we have given them by allah you shall most certainly be questioned about that which you forged
An-Nahl,19,0.7351,0.0,0.733,0.267,and they ascribe daughter to allah glory be to him and for themselves they would have what they desire

Al-Isra,41,0.5719,0.094,0.736,0.17,those whom they call upon themselves seek the mean of access to their lord whoever of them is nearest and they hope for his mercy and fear his chastisement surely the chastisement of your lord is thing to be cautious of
Al-Isra,28,-0.8402,0.309,0.574,0.117,and there is not town but we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or chastise it with severe chastisement this is written in the divine ordinance
Al-Isra,45,-0.91,0.219,0.781,0.0,and nothing could have hindered u that we should send sign except that the ancient rejected them and we gave to samood the she camel manifest sign but on her account they did injustice and we do not send sign but to make men fear
Al-Isra,49,0.6788,0.096,0.73,0.174,and when we said to you surely your lord encompasses men and we did not make the vision which we showed you but trial for men and the cursed tree in the quran a well and we cause them to fear but it only add to their great inordinacy
Al-Isra,32,0.3612,0.0,0.925,0.075,and when we said to the angel make obeisance to adam they made obeisance but iblis did it not he said shall make obeisance to him whom thou hast created of dust
Al-Isra,33,0.7574,0.0,0.827,0.173,he said tell me is this he whom thou hast honored above me if thou shouldst respite me to the day of resurrection will most certainly cause his progeny to perish except few
Al-Isra,19,-0.4019,0.188,0.694,0.118,he said be gone for whoever of them will follow you then surely hell is your recompense full recompense
Al-Isra,45,0.1154,0.07,0.791,0.138,and beguile whomsoever of them you can with your voice and collect against them your force riding and on foot and share with them in wealth and child and hold out promise to them and the shaitan make not promise to them but to deceive
Al-Isra,18,0.25,0.113,0.67,0.216,surely a for my servant you have no authority over them and your lord is sufficient a protector
Al-Isra,27,0.6908,0.0,0.814,0.186,your lord is he who speed the ship for you in the sea that you may seek of his grace surely he is ever merciful to you
Al-Isra,34,-0.3291,0.151,0.755,0.094,and when distress afflicts you in the sea away go those whom you call on except he but when he brings you safe to the land you turn aside and man is ever ungrateful
Al-Isra,30,0.34,0.0,0.924,0.076,what do you then feel secure that he will not cause tract of land to engulf you or send on you tornado then you shall not find protector for yourselves
Al-Isra,43,-0.5859,0.132,0.795,0.073,or do you feel secure that he will not take you back into it another time then send on you fierce gale and thus drown you on account of your ungratefulness then you shall not find any aider against u in the matter
Al-Isra,47,0.9565,0.0,0.687,0.313,and surely we have honored the child of adam and we carry them in the land and the sea and we have given them of the good thing and we have made them to excel by an appropriate excellence over most of those whom we have created
Al-Isra,36,0.4939,0.0,0.916,0.084,remember the day when we will call every people with their imam then whoever is given his book in his right hand these shall read their book and they shall not be dealt with whit unjustly
Al-Isra,20,-0.6597,0.231,0.769,0.0,and whoever is blind in this he shall also be blind in the hereafter and more erring from the way
Al-Isra,36,0.8176,0.0,0.79,0.21,and surely they had purposed to turn you away from that which we have revealed to you that you should forge against u other than that and then they would certainly have taken you for friend
Al-Isra,22,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,and had it not been that we had already established you you would certainly have been near to incline to them little
Al-Isra,31,-0.7579,0.257,0.623,0.12,in that case we would certainly have made you to taste double punishment in this life and double punishment after death then you would not have found any helper against u
Al-Isra,29,0.0,0.063,0.874,0.063,and surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they might expel you from it and in that case they will not tarry behind you but little
Al-Isra,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this is our course with regard to those of our apostle whom we sent before you and you shall not find change in our course
Al-Isra,25,0.2263,0.072,0.824,0.104,keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night and the morning recitation surely the morning recitation is witnessed
Al-Isra,25,0.872,0.0,0.69,0.31,and during part of the night pray tahajjud beyond what is incumbent on you maybe your lord will raise you to position of great glory
Al-Isra,29,0.3612,0.0,0.918,0.082,and say my lord make me to enter goodly entering and cause me to go forth goodly going forth and grant me from near thee power to assist me
Al-Isra,16,0.8402,0.0,0.545,0.455,and say the truth ha come and the falsehood ha vanished surely falsehood is vanishing thing
Al-Isra,25,-0.2023,0.115,0.799,0.087,and we reveal of the quran that which is healing and mercy to the believer and it add only to the perdition of the unjust
Al-Isra,21,-0.34,0.248,0.548,0.203,and when we bestow favor on man he turn aside and behaves proudly and when evil afflicts him he is despairing
Al-Isra,20,0.9274,0.0,0.608,0.392,say every one act according to his manner but your lord best know who is best guided in the path
Al-Isra,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you about the soul say the soul is one of the command of my lord and you are not given aught of knowledge but little
Al-Isra,27,0.5719,0.0,0.836,0.164,and if we please we should certainly take away that which we have revealed to you then you would not find for it any protector against u
Al-Isra,15,0.8957,0.0,0.526,0.474,but on account of mercy from your lord surely his grace to you is abundant
Al-Isra,31,0.6124,0.0,0.853,0.147,say if men and jinni should combine together to bring the like of this quran they could not bring the like of it though some of them were aiders of others
Al-Isra,24,-0.5266,0.183,0.755,0.061,and certainly we have explained for men in this quran every kind of similitude but most men do not consent to aught but denying
Al-Isra,23,-0.296,0.095,0.905,0.0,and they say we will by no mean believe in you until you cause fountain to gush forth from the earth for u
Al-Isra,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or you should have garden of palm and grape in the midst of which you should cause river to flow forth gushing out
Al-Isra,27,0.5106,0.0,0.875,0.125,or you should cause the heaven to come down upon u in piece a you think or bring allah and the angel face to face with u
Al-Isra,43,0.5267,0.0,0.901,0.099,or you should have house of gold or you should ascend into heaven and we will not believe in your ascending until you bring down to u book which we may read say glory be to my lord am aught but mortal apostle
Al-Isra,26,0.3239,0.039,0.874,0.087,and nothing prevented people from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said what ha allah raised up mortal to be an apostle
Al-Isra,28,0.6908,0.0,0.808,0.192,say had there been in the earth angel walking about a settler we would certainly have sent down to them from the heaven an angel a an apostle
Al-Isra,17,0.4404,0.0,0.838,0.162,say allah suffices a witness between me and you surely he is aware of his servant seeing
Al-Isra,60,-0.891,0.157,0.843,0.0,and whomsoever allah guide he is the follower of the right way and whomsoever he cause to err you shall not find for him guardian besides him and we will gather them together on the day of resurrection on their face blind and dumb and deaf their abode is hell whenever it becomes allayed we will add to their burning
Al-Isra,32,-0.128,0.075,0.865,0.061,this is their retribution because they disbelieved in our communication and said what when we shall have become bone and decayed particle shall we then indeed be raised up into new creation
Al-Isra,42,-0.7963,0.271,0.57,0.159,do they not consider that allah who created the heaven and the earth is able to create their like and he ha appointed for them doom about which there is no doubt but the unjust do not consent to aught but denying
Al-Isra,25,0.128,0.107,0.736,0.157,say if you control the treasure of the mercy of my lord then you would withhold them from fear of spending and man is niggardly
Al-Isra,34,0.624,0.075,0.727,0.198,and certainly we gave musa nine clear sign so ask the child of israel when he came to them firon said to him most surely deem you musa to be man deprived of reason
Al-Isra,35,0.953,0.0,0.628,0.372,he said truly you know that none but the lord of the heaven and the earth ha sent down these a clear proof and most surely believe you firon to be given over to perdition
Al-Isra,20,-0.7852,0.289,0.647,0.064,so he desired to destroy them out of the earth but we drowned him and those with him all together
Al-Isra,32,0.4215,0.0,0.888,0.112,and we said to the israelite after him dwell in the land and when the promise of the next life shall come to pas we will bring you both together in judgment
Al-Isra,29,0.85,0.0,0.692,0.308,and with truth have we revealed it and with truth did it come and we have not sent you but a the giver of good news and a warner
Al-Isra,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and it is quran which we have revealed in portion so that you may read it to the people by slow degree and we have revealed it revealing in portion
Al-Isra,29,-0.3412,0.079,0.921,0.0,say believe in it or believe not surely those who are given the knowledge before it fall down on their face making obeisance when it is recited to them
Al-Isra,19,0.9013,0.0,0.554,0.446,and they say glory be to our lord most surely the promise of our lord wa to be fulfilled
Al-Isra,14,-0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,and they fall down on their face weeping and it add to their humility
Al-Isra,41,0.872,0.0,0.793,0.207,say call upon allah or call upon the beneficent allah whichever you call upon he ha the best name and do not utter your prayer with very raised voice nor be silent with regard to it and seek way between these
Al-Isra,37,0.4471,0.162,0.616,0.222,and say all praise is due to allah who ha not taken son and who ha not partner in the kingdom and who ha not helper to save him from disgrace and proclaim his greatness magnifying him
Al-Kahf,21,0.5574,0.0,0.847,0.153,all praise is due to allah who revealed the book to his servant and did not make in it any crookedness
Al-Kahf,28,0.3182,0.207,0.554,0.239,rightly directing that he might give warning of severe punishment from him and give good news to the believer who do good that they shall have goodly reward
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,staying in it for ever
Al-Kahf,9,0.25,0.13,0.648,0.222,and warn those who say allah ha taken son
Al-Kahf,25,-0.3818,0.135,0.865,0.0,they have no knowledge of it nor had their father grievous word it is that come out of their mouth they speak nothing but lie
Al-Kahf,19,-0.891,0.398,0.602,0.0,then maybe you will kill yourself with grief sorrowing after them if they do not believe in this announcement
Al-Kahf,28,0.7964,0.0,0.779,0.221,surely we have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it so that we may try them a to which of them is best in work
Al-Kahf,14,0.4927,0.0,0.803,0.197,and most surely we will make what is on it bare ground without herbage
Al-Kahf,18,0.5719,0.0,0.821,0.179,or do you think that the fellow of the cave and the inscription were of our wonderful sign
Al-Kahf,26,0.6124,0.0,0.815,0.185,when the youth sought refuge in the cave they said our lord grant u mercy from thee and provide for u right course in our affair
Al-Kahf,13,0.1725,0.0,0.804,0.196,so we prevented them from hearing in the cave for number of year
Al-Kahf,25,0.7845,0.0,0.769,0.231,then we raised them up that we might know which of the two party wa best able to compute the time for which they remained
Al-Kahf,24,0.743,0.0,0.742,0.258,we relate to you their story with the truth surely they were youth who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,45,0.7184,0.043,0.798,0.16,and we strengthened their heart with patience when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth we will by no mean call upon any god besides him for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing
Al-Kahf,31,-0.1722,0.153,0.686,0.161,these our people have taken god besides him why do they not produce any clear authority in their support who is then more unjust than he who forge lie against allah
Al-Kahf,37,0.8885,0.0,0.719,0.281,and when you forsake them and what they worship save allah betake yourselves for refuge to the cave your lord will extend to you largely of his mercy and provide for you profitable course in your affair
Al-Kahf,68,0.7351,0.017,0.895,0.088,and you might see the sun when it rose decline from their cave towards the right hand and when it set leave them behind on the left while they were in wide space thereof this is of the sign of allah whomsoever allah guide he is the rightly guided one and whomsoever he cause to err you shall not find for him any friend to lead him aright
Al-Kahf,57,0.5859,0.0,0.92,0.08,and you might think them awake while they were asleep and we turned them about to the right and to the left while their dog lay outstretching it paw at the entrance if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them
Al-Kahf,92,0.6597,0.022,0.91,0.067,and thus did we rouse them that they might question each other speaker among them said how long have you tarried they said we have tarried for day or part of day others said your lord know best how long you have tarried now send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city then let him see which of them ha purest food so let him bring you provision from it and let him behave with gentleness and by no mean make your case known to any one
Al-Kahf,26,-0.5615,0.201,0.709,0.089,for surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion and then you will never succeed
Al-Kahf,66,0.6808,0.092,0.755,0.152,and thus did we make men to get knowledge of them that they might know that allah promise is true and that a for the hour there is no doubt about it when they disputed among themselves about their affair and said erect an edifice over them their lord best know them those who prevailed in their affair said we will certainly raise masjid over them
Al-Kahf,76,0.4477,0.014,0.921,0.065,some say they are three the fourth of them being their dog and others say five the sixth of them being their dog making conjecture at what is unknown and others yet say seven and the eighth of them is their dog say my lord best know their number none know them but few therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention and do not question concerning them any of them
Al-Kahf,11,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,and do not say of anything surely will do it tomorrow
Al-Kahf,26,-0.2263,0.071,0.929,0.0,unless allah plea and remember your lord when you forget and say maybe my lord will guide me to nearer course to the right than this
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they remained in their cave three hundred year and some add another nine
Al-Kahf,52,0.9136,0.0,0.791,0.209,say allah know best how long they remained to him are known the unseen thing of the heaven and the earth how clear his sight and how clear his hearing there is none to be guardian for them besides him and he doe not make any one his associate in his judgment
Al-Kahf,31,0.34,0.0,0.926,0.074,and recite what ha been revealed to you of the book of your lord there is none who can alter his word and you shall not find any refuge besides him
Al-Kahf,62,0.6597,0.031,0.873,0.096,and withhold yourself with those who call on their lord morning and evening desiring his goodwill and let not your eye pas from them desiring the beauty of this world life and do not follow him whose heart we have made unmindful to our remembrance and he follows his low desire and his case is one in which due bound are exceeded
Al-Kahf,63,-0.4019,0.184,0.641,0.175,and say the truth is from your lord so let him who please believe and let him who please disbelieve surely we have prepared for the iniquitous fire the curtain of which shall encompass them about and if they cry for water they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their face evil the drink and ill the resting place
Al-Kahf,21,0.7926,0.103,0.517,0.38,surely a for those who believe and do good we do not waste the reward of him who doe good work
Al-Kahf,53,0.6705,0.0,0.903,0.097,these it is for whom are garden of perpetuity beneath which river flow ornament shall be given to them therein of bracelet of gold and they shall wear green robe of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold reclining therein on raised couch excellent the recompense and goodly the resting place
Al-Kahf,36,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and set forth to them parable of two men for one of them we made two garden of grape vine and we surrounded them both with palm and in the midst of them we made cornfield
Al-Kahf,21,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,both these garden yielded their fruit and failed not aught thereof and we caused river to gush forth in their midst
Al-Kahf,26,0.7579,0.072,0.661,0.267,and he possessed much wealth so he said to his companion while he disputed with him have greater wealth than you and am mightier in follower
Al-Kahf,21,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,and he entered his garden while he wa unjust to himself he said do not think that this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,25,0.6801,0.0,0.804,0.196,and do not think the hour will come and even if am returned to my lord will most certainly find returning place better than this
Al-Kahf,29,0.2023,0.138,0.702,0.16,his companion said to him while disputing with him do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from small seed then he made you perfect man
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but a for me he allah is my lord and do not associate anyone with my lord
Al-Kahf,37,0.7783,0.105,0.644,0.251,and wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden it is a allah ha pleased there is no power save in allah if you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,29,0.7351,0.0,0.813,0.187,then maybe my lord will give me what is better than your garden and send on it thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or it water should sink down into the ground so that you are unable to find it
Al-Kahf,42,0.1779,0.114,0.758,0.128,and his wealth wa destroyed so he began to wring his hand for what he had spent on it while it lay having fallen down upon it roof and he said ah me would that had not associated anyone with my lord
Al-Kahf,15,0.128,0.123,0.726,0.151,and he had no host to help him besides allah nor could he defend himself
Al-Kahf,20,0.9538,0.0,0.464,0.536,here is protection only allah the true one he is best in the giving of reward and best in requiting
Al-Kahf,54,-0.1531,0.054,0.903,0.043,and set forth to them parable of the life of this world like water which we send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it then it becomes dry broken into piece which the wind scatter and allah is the holder of power over all thing
Al-Kahf,30,0.9509,0.0,0.573,0.427,wealth and child are an adornment of the life of this world and the ever abiding the good work are better with your lord in reward and better in expectation
Al-Kahf,34,-0.0516,0.035,0.965,0.0,and the day on which we will cause the mountain to pas away and you will see the earth levelled plain and we will gather them and leave not any one of them behind
Al-Kahf,41,0.6908,0.0,0.843,0.157,and they shall be brought before your lord standing in rank now certainly you have come to u a we created you at first nay you thought that we had not appointed to you time of the fulfillment of the promise
Al-Kahf,62,-0.7047,0.126,0.852,0.022,and the book shall be placed then you will see the guilty fearing from what is in it and they will say ah woe to u what book is this it doe not omit small one nor great one but number them all and what they had done they shall find present there and your lord doe not deal unjustly with anyone
Al-Kahf,58,-0.9186,0.208,0.734,0.058,and when we said to the angel make obeisance to adam they made obeisance but iblis did it not he wa of the jinni so he transgressed the commandment of his lord what would you then take him and his offspring for friend rather than me and they are your enemy evil is this change for the unjust
Al-Kahf,32,0.7579,0.0,0.795,0.205,did not make them witness of the creation of the heaven and the earth nor of the creation of their own soul nor could take those who lead others astray for aiders
Al-Kahf,37,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and on the day when he shall say call on those whom you considered to be my associate so they shall call on them but they shall not answer them and we will cause separation between them
Al-Kahf,32,-0.6369,0.148,0.852,0.0,and the guilty shall see the fire then they shall know that they are going to fall into it and they shall not find place to which to turn away from it
Al-Kahf,21,0.34,0.0,0.893,0.107,and certainly we have explained in this quran every kind of example and man is most of all given to contention
Al-Kahf,40,0.2211,0.03,0.92,0.051,and nothing prevents men from believing when the guidance come to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that what happened to the ancient should overtake them or that the chastisement should come face to face with them
Al-Kahf,43,-0.1531,0.204,0.621,0.176,and we do not send apostle but a giver of good news and warning and those who disbelieve make false contention that they may render null thereby the truth and they take my communication and that with which they are warned for mockery
Al-Kahf,68,0.3626,0.048,0.87,0.082,and who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communication of his lord then he turn away from them and forgets what his two hand have sent before surely we have placed veil over their heart lest they should understand it and heaviness in their ear and if you call them to the guidance they will not ever follow the right course in that case
Al-Kahf,42,0.296,0.048,0.833,0.118,and your lord is forgiving the lord of mercy were he to punish them for what they earn he would certainly have hastened the chastisement for them but for them there is an appointed time from which they shall not find refuge
Al-Kahf,20,-0.7845,0.289,0.711,0.0,and a for these town we destroyed them when they acted unjustly and we have appointed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,24,-0.0191,0.045,0.955,0.0,and when musa said to his servant will not cease until reach the junction of the two river or will go on for year
Al-Kahf,25,0.1027,0.0,0.945,0.055,so when they had reached the junction of the two river they forgot their fish and it took it way into the sea going away
Al-Kahf,27,0.1531,0.084,0.811,0.105,but when they had gone farther he said to his servant bring to u our morning meal certainly we have met with fatigue from this our journey
Al-Kahf,38,0.0857,0.0,0.965,0.035,he said did you see when we took refuge on the rock then forgot the fish and nothing made me forget to speak of it but the shaitan and it took it way into the river what wonder
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this is what we sought for so they returned retracing their footstep
Al-Kahf,23,0.5423,0.0,0.816,0.184,then they found one from among our servant whom we had granted mercy from u and whom we had taught knowledge from ourselves
Al-Kahf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said to him shall follow you on condition that you should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught
Al-Kahf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,he said surely you cannot have patience with me
Al-Kahf,16,-0.1877,0.104,0.896,0.0,and how can you have patience in that of which you have not got comprehensive knowledge
Al-Kahf,18,0.0258,0.0,0.939,0.061,he said if allah plea you will find me patient and shall not disobey you in any matter
Al-Kahf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said if you would follow me then do not question me about any thing until myself speak to you about it
Al-Kahf,35,-0.6486,0.163,0.779,0.058,so they went their way until when they embarked in the boat he made hole in it musa said have you made hole in it to drown it inmate certainly you have done grievous thing
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not say that you will not be able to have patience with me
Al-Kahf,19,-0.5994,0.224,0.776,0.0,he said blame me not for what forgot and do not constrain me to difficult thing in my affair
Al-Kahf,31,-0.1531,0.118,0.753,0.129,so they went on until when they met boy he slew him musa said have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter certainly you have done an evil thing
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not say to you that you will not be able to have patience with me
Al-Kahf,26,0.0772,0.0,0.951,0.049,he said if ask you about anything after this keep me not in your company indeed you shall have then found an excuse in my case
Al-Kahf,60,0.7351,0.069,0.787,0.144,so they went on until when they came to the people of town they asked them for food but they refused to entertain them a guest then they found in it wall which wa on the point of falling so he put it into right state musa said if you had pleased you might certainly have taken recompense for it
Al-Kahf,26,0.2732,0.0,0.923,0.077,he said this shall be separation between me and you now will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience
Al-Kahf,33,-0.743,0.174,0.826,0.0,a for the boat it belonged to some poor men who worked on the river and wished that should damage it and there wa behind them king who seized every boat by force
Al-Kahf,23,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and a for the boy his parent were believer and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them
Al-Kahf,23,0.8062,0.0,0.707,0.293,so we desired that their lord might give them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion
Al-Kahf,70,0.8542,0.0,0.849,0.151,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the city and there wa beneath it treasure belonging to them and their father wa righteous man so your lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure mercy from your lord and did not do it of my own accord this is the significance of that with which you could not have patience

Al-Kahf,16,0.5994,0.0,0.741,0.259,surely we established him in the land and granted him mean of access to every thing
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he followed course
Al-Kahf,34,0.5267,0.0,0.879,0.121,until when he reached the place where the sun set he found it going down into black sea and found by it people we said zulqarnain either give them chastisement or do them benefit
Al-Kahf,29,-0.8834,0.292,0.708,0.0,he said a to him who is unjust we will chastise him then shall he be returned to his lord and he will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement
Al-Kahf,26,0.8591,0.0,0.698,0.302,and a for him who belief and doe good he shall have goodly reward and we will speak to him an easy word of our command
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed another course
Al-Kahf,27,-0.2023,0.077,0.874,0.049,until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun he found it rising on people to whom we had given no shelter from it
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,even so and we had full knowledge of what he had
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed another course
Al-Kahf,22,0.1027,0.0,0.938,0.062,until when he reached place between the two mountain he found on that side of them people who could hardly understand word
Al-Kahf,29,-0.128,0.167,0.743,0.09,they said zulqarnain surely gog and magog make mischief in the land shall we then pay you tribute on condition that you should raise barrier between u and them
Al-Kahf,27,0.7579,0.046,0.708,0.246,he said that in which my lord ha established me is better therefore you only help me with worker will make fortified barrier between you and them
Al-Kahf,40,-0.6486,0.125,0.875,0.0,bring me block of iron until when he had filled up the space between the two mountain side he said blow until when he had made it a fire he said bring me molten brass which may pour over it
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they were not able to scale it nor could they make hole in it
Al-Kahf,35,0.8847,0.0,0.732,0.268,he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord come to pas he will make it level with the ground and the promise of my lord is ever true
Al-Kahf,28,-0.3612,0.119,0.881,0.0,and on that day we will leave part of them in conflict with another part and the trumpet will be blown so we will gather them all together
Al-Kahf,15,-0.7096,0.312,0.688,0.0,and we will bring forth hell exposed to view on that day before the unbeliever
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they whose eye were under cover from my reminder and they could not even hear
Al-Kahf,29,-0.0516,0.177,0.625,0.198,what do then those who disbelieve think that they can take my servant to be guardian besides me surely we have prepared hell for the entertainment of the unbeliever
Al-Kahf,12,0.2023,0.193,0.568,0.239,say shall we inform you of the greatest loser in their deed
Al-Kahf,26,0.4588,0.075,0.752,0.173,these are they whose labor is lost in this world life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hand
Al-Kahf,34,-0.296,0.062,0.937,0.0,these are they who disbelieve in the communication of their lord and his meeting so their deed become null and therefore we will not set up balance for them on the day of resurrection
Al-Kahf,20,-0.7845,0.277,0.723,0.0,thus it is that their recompense is hell because they disbelieved and held my communication and my apostle in mockery
Al-Kahf,20,0.9153,0.0,0.54,0.46,surely a for those who believe and do good deed their place of entertainment shall be the garden of paradise
Al-Kahf,9,-0.3089,0.22,0.78,0.0,abiding therein they shall not desire removal from them
Al-Kahf,38,0.4404,0.058,0.816,0.126,say if the sea were ink for the word of my lord the sea would surely be consumed before the word of my lord are exhausted though we were to bring the like of that sea to add
Al-Kahf,40,0.8182,0.04,0.74,0.22,say am only mortal like you it is revealed to me that your god is one allah therefore whoever hope to meet his lord he should do good deed and not join any one in the service of his lord

Maryam,21,-0.3679,0.29,0.461,0.249,but there came after them an evil generation who neglected prayer and followed and sensual desire so they win meet perdition
Maryam,25,0.4404,0.0,0.888,0.112,except such a repent and believe and do good these shall enter the garden and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way

Maryam,46,-0.8832,0.272,0.626,0.102,say a for him who remains in error the beneficent allah will surely prolong his length of day until they see what they were threatened with either the punishment or the hour then they shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in force
Maryam,26,0.9274,0.0,0.618,0.382,and allah increase in guidance those who go aright and ever abiding good work are with your lord best in recompense and best in yielding fruit

Ta-Ha,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,firon said and who is your lord musa
Ta-Ha,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,he said our lord is he who gave to everything it creation then guided it to it goal
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said then what is the state of the former generation
Ta-Ha,19,0.1695,0.0,0.915,0.085,he said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in book my lord errs not nor doe he forget
Ta-Ha,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you therein path and sent down water from the cloud then thereby we have brought forth many specie of various herb

Ta-Ha,22,0.25,0.0,0.913,0.087,from it we created you and into it we shall send you back and from it will we raise you second time
Ta-Ha,15,-0.743,0.342,0.566,0.092,and truly we showed him our sign all of them but he rejected and refused
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said he have you come to u that you should turn u out of our land by your magic musa
Ta-Ha,30,0.3612,0.0,0.918,0.082,so we too will produce before you magic like it therefore make between u and you an appointment which we should not break neither we nor you in central place
Ta-Ha,21,0.4939,0.0,0.862,0.138,musa said your appointment is the day of the festival and let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so firon turned his back and settled his plan then came
Ta-Ha,30,-0.8625,0.307,0.625,0.068,musa said to them woe to you do not forge lie against allah lest he destroy you by punishment and he who forge lie indeed fails to attain his desire
Ta-Ha,14,-0.3976,0.171,0.829,0.0,so they disputed with one another about their affair and kept the discourse secret
Ta-Ha,27,0.8777,0.0,0.704,0.296,they said these are most surely two magician who wish to turn you out from your land by their magic and to take away your best tradition
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore settle your plan then come standing in rank and he will prosper indeed this day who overcomes
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said musa will you cast or shall we be the first who cast down
Ta-Ha,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said nay cast down then lo their cord and their rod it wa imaged to him on account of their magic a if they were running
Ta-Ha,7,-0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,so musa conceived in his mind fear
Ta-Ha,10,-0.6814,0.412,0.588,0.0,we said fear not surely you shall be the uppermost
Ta-Ha,36,0.033,0.076,0.844,0.079,and cast down what is in your right hand it shall devour what they have wrought they have wrought only the plan of magician and the magician shall not be successful wheresoever he may come from
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician were cast down making obeisance they said we believe in the lord of haroun and musa
Ta-Ha,67,0.6637,0.115,0.715,0.17,firon said you believe in him before give you leave most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment therefore will certainly cut off your hand and your foot on opposite side and will certainly crucify you on the trunk of the palm tree and certainly you will come to know which of u is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising
Ta-Ha,38,0.3612,0.062,0.815,0.123,they said we do not prefer you to what ha come to u of clear argument and to he who made u therefore decide what you are going to decide you can only decide about this world life
Ta-Ha,28,0.5423,0.107,0.623,0.27,surely we believe in our lord that he may forgive u our sin and the magic to which you compelled u and allah is better and more abiding
Ta-Ha,21,-0.33,0.243,0.558,0.199,whoever come to his lord being guilty for him is surely hell he shall not die therein nor shall he live
Ta-Ha,22,0.6486,0.0,0.791,0.209,and whoever come to him believer and he ha done good deed indeed these it is who shall have the high rank
Ta-Ha,22,0.7269,0.0,0.766,0.234,the garden of perpetuity beneath which river flow to abide therein and this is the reward of him who ha purified himself
Ta-Ha,30,0.6595,0.0,0.838,0.162,and certainly we revealed to musa saying travel by night with my servant then make for them dry path in the sea not fearing to be overtaken nor being afraid
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and firon followed them with his army so there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and firon led astray his people and he did not guide them aright
Ta-Ha,33,0.1027,0.091,0.807,0.102,child of israel indeed we delivered you from your enemy and we made covenant with you on the blessed side of the mountain and we sent to you the manna and the quail
Ta-Ha,38,0.089,0.062,0.868,0.07,eat of the good thing we have given you for sustenance and be not inordinate with respect to them lest my wrath should be due to you and to whomsoever my wrath is due be shall perish indeed
Ta-Ha,22,0.8514,0.0,0.672,0.328,and most surely am most forgiving to him who repents and belief and doe good then continues to follow the right direction
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and what caused you to hasten from your people musa
Ta-Ha,20,0.4404,0.0,0.868,0.132,he said they are here on my track and hastened on to thee my lord that thou mightest be pleased
Ta-Ha,18,0.7304,0.0,0.723,0.277,he said so surely we have tried your people after you and the samiri ha led them astray
Ta-Ha,50,-0.8922,0.251,0.704,0.044,so musa returned to his people wrathful sorrowing said he my people did not your lord promise you goodly promise did then the time seem long to you or did you wish that displeasure from your lord should be due to you so that you broke your promise to me
Ta-Ha,40,-0.6521,0.123,0.877,0.0,they said we did not break our promise to you of our own accord but we were made to bear the burden of the ornament of the people then we made casting of them and thus did the samiri suggest
Ta-Ha,28,0.2732,0.0,0.893,0.107,so he brought forth for them calf mere body which had mooing sound so they said this is your god and the god of musa but he forgot
Ta-Ha,25,0.705,0.0,0.797,0.203,what could they not see that it did not return to them reply and that it did not control any harm or benefit for them
Ta-Ha,31,0.8225,0.0,0.765,0.235,and certainly haroun had said to them before my people you are only tried by it and surely your lord is the beneficent allah therefore follow me and obey my order
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.113,0.773,0.113,they said we will by no mean cease to keep to it worship until musa return to u
Ta-Ha,12,0.0258,0.0,0.909,0.091,musa said haroun what prevented you when you saw them going astray
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so that you did not follow me did you then disobey my order
Ta-Ha,38,0.4404,0.0,0.927,0.073,he said son of my mother seize me not by my beard nor by my head surely wa afraid lest you should say you have caused division among the child of israel and not waited for my word
Ta-Ha,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said what wa then your object samiri
Ta-Ha,34,0.4404,0.0,0.919,0.081,he said saw jibreel what they did not see so took handful of the dust from the footstep of the messenger then threw it in the casting thus did my soul commend to me
Ta-Ha,62,0.7184,0.091,0.712,0.197,he said begone then surely for you it will be in this life to say touch me not and surely there is threat for you which shall not be made to fail to you and look at your god to whose worship you kept so long we will certainly burn it then we will certainly scatter it wide scattering in the sea
Ta-Ha,18,-0.0129,0.084,0.836,0.081,your allah is only allah there is no god but he he comprehends all thing in his knowledge
Ta-Ha,25,0.34,0.0,0.909,0.091,thus do we relate to you some of the news of what ha gone before and indeed we have given to you reminder from ourselves
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.154,0.691,0.154,whoever turn aside from it he shall surely bear burden on the day of resurrection
Ta-Ha,18,-0.6597,0.206,0.794,0.0,abiding in this state and evil will it be for them to bear on the day of resurrection
Ta-Ha,20,-0.4215,0.128,0.872,0.0,on the day when the trumpet shall be blown and we will gather the guilty blue eyed on that day
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they shall consult together secretly you did tarry but ten century
Ta-Ha,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,we know best what they say when the fairest of them in course would say you tarried but day
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you about the mountain say my lord will carry them away from the root
Ta-Ha,6,-0.0516,0.194,0.806,0.0,then leave it plain smooth level
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you shall not see therein any crookedness or unevenness
Ta-Ha,34,0.0,0.087,0.854,0.059,on that day they shall follow the inviter there is no crookedness in him and the voice shall be low before the beneficent allah so that you shall not hear aught but soft sound
Ta-Ha,22,0.6124,0.08,0.693,0.226,on that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the beneficent allah allows and whose word he is pleased with
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he know what is before them and what is behind them while they do not comprehend it in knowledge
Ta-Ha,21,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,and the face shall be humbled before the living the self subsistent allah and he who bear iniquity is indeed failure
Ta-Ha,23,-0.7351,0.294,0.613,0.094,and whoever doe good work and he is believer he shall have no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of his due
Ta-Ha,32,-0.8316,0.206,0.794,0.0,and thus have we sent it down an arabic quran and have distinctly set forth therein of threat that they may guard against evil or that it may produce reminder for them
Ta-Ha,33,0.8074,0.0,0.783,0.217,supremely exalted is therefore allah the king the truth and do not make haste with the quran before it revelation is made complete to you and say my lord increase me in knowledge
Ta-Ha,20,0.6428,0.0,0.774,0.226,and certainly we gave commandment to adam before but he forgot and we did not find in him any determination
Ta-Ha,21,0.3252,0.0,0.896,0.104,and when we said to the angel make obeisance to adam they made obeisance but iblis did it not he refused
Ta-Ha,31,-0.743,0.178,0.822,0.0,so we said adam this is an enemy to you and to your wife therefore let him not drive you both forth from the garden so that you should be unhappy
Ta-Ha,17,0.4404,0.0,0.847,0.153,surely it is ordained for you that you shall not be hungry therein nor bare of clothing
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and that you shall not be thirsty therein nor shall you feel the heat of the sun
Ta-Ha,25,-0.8922,0.296,0.704,0.0,but the shaitan made an evil suggestion to him he said adam shall guide you to the tree of immortality and kingdom which decay not
Ta-Ha,38,-0.8849,0.206,0.794,0.0,then they both ate of it so their evil inclination became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with leaf of the garden and adam disobeyed his lord so his life became evil to him
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then his lord chose him so he turned to him and guided him
Ta-Ha,40,0.249,0.076,0.804,0.119,he said get forth you two therefrom all of you one of you is enemy to another so there will surely come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance he shall not go astray nor be unhappy
Ta-Ha,23,-0.4019,0.109,0.891,0.0,and whoever turn away from my reminder his shall be straitened life and we will raise him on the day of resurrection blind
Ta-Ha,16,-0.4019,0.153,0.847,0.0,he shall say my lord why hast thou raised me blind and wa seeing one indeed
Ta-Ha,22,-0.6808,0.18,0.82,0.0,he will say even so our communication came to you but you neglected them even thus shall you be forsaken this day
Ta-Ha,30,-0.0516,0.079,0.848,0.073,and thus do we recompense him who is extravagant and doe not believe in the communication of his lord and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more
Ta-Ha,35,0.024,0.081,0.81,0.109,doe it not then direct them aright how many of the generation in whose dwelling place they go about we destroyed before them most surely there are sign in this for those endowed with understanding
Ta-Ha,28,0.4404,0.0,0.903,0.097,and had there not been word that had already gone forth from your lord and an appointed term it would surely have been made to cleave to them
Ta-Ha,47,0.9423,0.0,0.725,0.275,bear then patiently what they say and glorify your lord by the praising of him before the rising of the sun and before it setting and during hour of the night do also glorify him and during part of the day that you may be well pleased
Ta-Ha,42,0.7845,0.0,0.853,0.147,and do not stretch your eye after that with which we have provided different class of them of the splendor of this world life that we may thereby try them and the sustenance given by your lord is better and more abiding
Ta-Ha,32,-0.3612,0.118,0.804,0.078,and enjoin prayer on your follower and steadily adhere to it we do not ask you for subsistence we do give you subsistence and the good end is for guarding against evil
Ta-Ha,29,0.6124,0.0,0.839,0.161,and they say why doe he not bring to u sign from his lord ha not there come to them clear evidence of what is in the previous book
Ta-Ha,40,-0.7964,0.203,0.746,0.051,and had we destroyed them with chastisement before this they would certainly have said our lord why didst thou not send to u an apostle for then we should have followed thy communication before that we met disgrace and shame
Ta-Ha,28,0.1027,0.0,0.949,0.051,say every one of u is awaiting therefore do await so you will come to know who is the follower of the even path and who go aright
Al-Anbiya,14,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,their reckoning ha drawn near to men and in heedlessness are they turning aside
Al-Anbiya,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,there come not to them new reminder from their lord but they hear it while they sport
Al-Anbiya,29,-0.5879,0.151,0.849,0.0,their heart trifling and those who are unjust counsel together in secret he is nothing but mortal like yourselves what will you then yield to enchantment while you see
Al-Anbiya,21,0.5106,0.0,0.858,0.142,he said my lord know what is spoken in the heaven and the earth and he is the hearing the knowing
Al-Anbiya,29,0.5267,0.0,0.85,0.15,nay say they medley of dream nay he ha forged it nay he is poet so let him bring to u sign a the former prophet were sent with
Al-Anbiya,15,-0.4939,0.186,0.814,0.0,there did not believe before them any town which we destroyed will they then believe
Al-Anbiya,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we did not send before you any but men to whom we sent revelation so ask the follower of the reminder if you do not
Al-Anbiya,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we did not make them body not eating the food and they were not to abide forever
Al-Anbiya,22,0.5994,0.109,0.614,0.276,then we made our promise good to them so we delivered them and those whom we pleased and we destroyed the extravagant
Al-Anbiya,19,0.6486,0.0,0.762,0.238,certainly we have revealed to you book in which is your good remembrance what do you not then understand
Al-Anbiya,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how many town which wa iniquitous did we demolish and we raised up after it another people
Al-Anbiya,11,-0.4939,0.242,0.758,0.0,so when they felt our punishment lo they began to fly
Al-Anbiya,26,0.3818,0.049,0.81,0.141,do not fly now and come back to what you were made to lead easy life in and to your dwelling haply you will be questioned
Al-Anbiya,9,-0.4939,0.436,0.357,0.207,they said woe to u surely we were unjust
Al-Anbiya,15,-0.6369,0.286,0.714,0.0,and this ceased not to be their cry till we made them cut off extinct
Al-Anbiya,17,-0.5448,0.231,0.769,0.0,and we did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,had we wished to make diversion we would have made it from before ourselves by no mean would we do it
Al-Anbiya,26,-0.128,0.096,0.825,0.079,nay we cast the truth against the falsehood so that it break it head and lo it vanishes and woe to you for what you describe
Al-Anbiya,28,-0.091,0.141,0.759,0.1,and whoever is in the heaven and the earth is his and those who are with him are not proud to serve him nor do they grow weary
Al-Anbiya,11,0.5719,0.0,0.73,0.27,they glorify him by night and day they are never languid
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.4939,0.262,0.61,0.128,or have they taken god from the earth who raise the dead
Al-Anbiya,36,0.6486,0.063,0.749,0.187,if there had been in them any god except allah they would both have certainly been in state of disorder therefore glory be to allah the lord of the dominion above what they attribute to him
Al-Anbiya,13,0.1511,0.0,0.809,0.191,he cannot be questioned concerning what he doe and they shall be questioned
Al-Anbiya,39,0.0356,0.048,0.901,0.051,or have they taken god besides him say bring your proof this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me nay most of them do not know the truth so they turn aside
Al-Anbiya,24,-0.0387,0.102,0.801,0.097,and we did not send before you any apostle but we revealed to him that there is no god but me therefore serve me
Al-Anbiya,20,0.9186,0.0,0.552,0.448,and they say the beneficent allah ha taken to himself son glory be to him nay they are honored servant

Al-Muminun,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we raised after them other generation
Al-Muminun,12,-0.4997,0.315,0.578,0.107,no people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone it
Al-Muminun,40,-0.5106,0.078,0.922,0.0,then we sent our apostle one after another whenever there came to people their apostle they called him liar so we made some of them follow others and we made them story so away with people who do not believe
Al-Muminun,14,0.4404,0.0,0.755,0.245,then we sent musa and his brother haroun with our communication and clear authority
Al-Muminun,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to firon and his chief but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people
Al-Muminun,17,0.3612,0.0,0.857,0.143,and they said what shall we believe in two mortal like ourselves while their people serve u
Al-Muminun,11,-0.7769,0.43,0.57,0.0,so they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed
Al-Muminun,13,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,and certainly we gave musa the book that they may follow right direction
Al-Muminun,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made the son of marium and his mother sign and we gave them shelter on lofty ground having meadow and spring

Al-Muminun,19,0.5499,0.107,0.684,0.209,but they cut off their religion among themselves into sect each part rejoicing in that which is with them
Al-Muminun,8,-0.4019,0.381,0.619,0.0,therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till
Al-Muminun,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,do they think that by what we aid them with of wealth and child
Al-Muminun,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,we are hastening to them of good thing nay they do not perceive

Al-Muminun,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and those who believe in the communication of their lord
Al-Muminun,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and those who do not associate aught with their lord
Al-Muminun,23,-0.4939,0.127,0.873,0.0,and those who give what they give in alms while their heart are full of fear that to their lord they must return

Al-Muminun,16,-0.5574,0.282,0.602,0.116,in arrogance talking nonsense about the quran and left him like one telling fable by night
Al-Muminun,31,0.34,0.0,0.926,0.074,is it then that they do not ponder over what is said or is it that there ha come to them that which did not come to their father of old
Al-Muminun,15,-0.3947,0.16,0.84,0.0,or is it that they have not recognized their apostle so that they deny him
Al-Muminun,25,0.4767,0.094,0.68,0.227,or do they say there is madness in him nay he ha brought them the truth and most of them are averse from the truth
Al-Muminun,38,0.6187,0.037,0.783,0.18,and should the truth follow their low desire surely the heaven and the earth and all those who are therein would have perished nay we have brought to them their reminder but from their reminder they turn aside
Al-Muminun,26,0.9274,0.0,0.674,0.326,or is it that you ask them recompense but the recompense of your lord is best and he is the best of those who provide sustenance
Al-Muminun,9,0.6195,0.0,0.581,0.419,and most surely you invite them to right way
Al-Muminun,16,0.4927,0.0,0.824,0.176,and most surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way
Al-Muminun,22,-0.2263,0.131,0.772,0.097,and if we show mercy to them and remove the distress they have they would persist in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
Al-Muminun,20,0.3491,0.0,0.886,0.114,and already we overtook them with chastisement but they were not submissive to their lord nor do they humble themselves
Al-Muminun,17,-0.5994,0.246,0.754,0.0,until when we open upon them door of severe chastisement lo they are in despair at it
Al-Muminun,23,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,and he it is who made for you the ear and the eye and the heart little is it that you give thanks

An-Naml,16,-0.25,0.178,0.693,0.129,ta sin these are the verse of the quran and the book that make thing clear
An-Naml,7,0.4404,0.0,0.674,0.326,guidance and good news for the believer
An-Naml,16,-0.296,0.227,0.657,0.116,who keep up prayer and pay the poor rate and of the hereafter they are sure
An-Naml,25,0.3818,0.0,0.859,0.141,a to those who do not believe in the hereafter we have surely made their deed fair seeming to them but they blindly wander on
An-Naml,19,-0.7783,0.364,0.497,0.139,these are they who shall have an evil punishment and in the hereafter they shall be the greatest loser
An-Naml,16,0.7425,0.0,0.69,0.31,and most surely you are made to receive the quran from the wise the knowing allah
An-Naml,31,0.34,0.068,0.795,0.136,when musa said to his family surely see fire will bring to you from it some news or will bring to you therefrom burning firebrand so that you may warm yourselves
An-Naml,32,0.7184,0.062,0.747,0.191,so when he came to it voice wa uttered saying blessed is whoever is in the fire and whatever is about it and glory be to allah the lord of the world
An-Naml,8,0.7184,0.0,0.5,0.5,musa surely am allah the mighty the wise
An-Naml,37,0.431,0.059,0.812,0.129,and cast down your staff so when he saw it in motion a if it were serpent he turned back retreating and did not return musa fear not surely the apostle shall not fear in my presence
An-Naml,20,-0.2584,0.3,0.432,0.268,neither he who ha been unjust then he doe good instead after evil for surely am the forgiving the merciful
An-Naml,30,0.863,0.0,0.737,0.263,and enter your hand into the opening of your bosom it shall come forth white without evil among nine sign to firon and his people surely they are transgressing people
An-Naml,14,0.6934,0.0,0.677,0.323,so when our clear sign came to them they said this is clear enchantment
An-Naml,25,0.2263,0.165,0.642,0.193,and they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them consider then how wa the end of the mischief maker
An-Naml,28,0.886,0.0,0.669,0.331,and certainly we gave knowledge to dawood and sulaiman and they both said praise be to allah who ha made u to excel many of his believing servant
An-Naml,30,0.7178,0.0,0.824,0.176,and sulaiman wa dawood heir and he said men we have been taught the language of bird and we have been given all thing most surely this is manifest grace
An-Naml,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and his host of the jinni and the men and the bird were gathered to him and they were formed into group
An-Naml,30,0.1139,0.0,0.953,0.047,until when they came to the valley of the naml namlite said naml enter your house that sulaiman and his host may not crush you while they do not know
An-Naml,54,0.969,0.0,0.66,0.34,so he smiled wondering at her word and said my lord grant me that should be grateful for thy favor which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parent and that should do good such a thou art pleased with and make me enter by thy mercy into thy servant the good one
An-Naml,23,-0.2732,0.087,0.913,0.0,and he reviewed the bird then said how is it see not the hoopoe or is it that he is of the absentee
An-Naml,19,-0.8716,0.437,0.4,0.163,will most certainly punish him with severe punishment or kill him or he shall bring to me clear plea
An-Naml,23,0.3182,0.0,0.905,0.095,and he tarried not long then said comprehend that which you do not comprehend and have brought to you sure information from sheba
An-Naml,17,0.7717,0.0,0.645,0.355,surely found woman ruling over them and she ha been given abundance and she ha mighty throne
An-Naml,35,0.8074,0.0,0.794,0.206,found her and her people adoring the sun instead of allah and the shaitan ha made their deed fair seeming to them and thus turned them from the way so they do not go aright
An-Naml,30,0.3818,0.052,0.848,0.1,that they do not make obeisance to allah who brings forth what is hidden in the heaven and the earth and know what you hide and what you make manifest
An-Naml,14,-0.0129,0.106,0.792,0.102,allah there is no god but he he is the lord of mighty power
An-Naml,18,-0.25,0.153,0.741,0.106,he said we will see whether you have told the truth or whether you are of the liar
An-Naml,21,0.4939,0.0,0.862,0.138,take this my letter and hand it over to them then turn away from them and see what answer they return
An-Naml,12,0.8316,0.0,0.506,0.494,she said chief surely an honorable letter ha been delivered to me
An-Naml,18,0.8442,0.0,0.622,0.378,surely it is from sulaiman and surely it is in the name of allah the beneficent the merciful
An-Naml,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,saying exalt not yourselves against me and come to me in submission
An-Naml,19,0.4939,0.0,0.849,0.151,she said chief give me advice respecting my affair never decide an affair until you are in my presence
An-Naml,23,0.4939,0.0,0.873,0.127,they said we are possessor of strength and possessor of mighty prowess and the command is yours therefore see what you will command
An-Naml,26,-0.4588,0.186,0.723,0.091,she said surely the king when they enter town ruin it and make the noblest of it people to be low and thus they always do
An-Naml,21,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,and surely am going to send present to them and shall wait to see what answer do the apostle bring back
An-Naml,37,0.9612,0.0,0.614,0.386,so when he came to sulaiman he said what will you help me with wealth but what allah ha given me is better than what he ha given you nay you are exultant because of your present
An-Naml,40,0.002,0.115,0.77,0.115,go back to them so we will most certainly come to them with host which they shall have no power to oppose and we will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement and they shall be in state of ignominy
An-Naml,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said chief which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission
An-Naml,27,0.8969,0.0,0.66,0.34,one audacious among the jinni said will bring it to you before you rise up from your place and most surely am strong and trusty for it
An-Naml,72,0.91,0.068,0.723,0.209,one who had the knowledge of the book said will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye then when he saw it settled beside him he said this is of the grace of my lord that he may try me whether am grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful he is grateful only for his own soul and whoever is ungrateful then surely my lord is self sufficient honored
An-Naml,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said alter her throne for her we will see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright
An-Naml,33,0.0516,0.066,0.862,0.072,so when she came it wa said is your throne like this she said it is a it were the same and we were given the knowledge before it and we were submissive
An-Naml,15,0.7096,0.088,0.537,0.376,and what she worshipped besides allah prevented her surely she wa of an unbelieving people
An-Naml,57,0.872,0.063,0.749,0.189,it wa said to her enter the palace but when she saw it she deemed it to be great expanse of water and bared her leg he said surely it is palace made smooth with glass she said my lord surely have been unjust to myself and submit with sulaiman to allah the lord of the world
An-Naml,22,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,and certainly we sent to samood their brother salih saying serve allah and lo they became two sect quarrelling with each other
An-Naml,32,-0.5129,0.163,0.761,0.076,he said my people why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good why do you not ask forgiveness of allah so that you may be dealt with mercifully
An-Naml,37,-0.6369,0.163,0.769,0.068,they said we have met with ill luck on account of you and on account of those with you he said the cause of your evil fortune is with allah nay you are people who are tried
An-Naml,19,-0.3612,0.122,0.878,0.0,and there were in the city nine person who made mischief in the land and did not act aright
An-Naml,44,0.821,0.079,0.702,0.219,they said swear to each other by allah that we will certainly make sudden attack on him and his family by night then we will say to his heir we did not witness the destruction of his family and we are most surely truthful
An-Naml,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they planned plan and we planned plan while they perceived not
An-Naml,19,-0.4939,0.151,0.849,0.0,see then how wa the end of their plan that we destroyed them and their people all of them
An-Naml,22,-0.3832,0.207,0.679,0.114,so those are their house fallen down because they were unjust most surely there is sign in this for people who know
An-Naml,11,-0.6597,0.306,0.694,0.0,and we delivered those who believed and who guarded against evil
An-Naml,18,0.296,0.0,0.885,0.115,and we sent lut when he said to his people what do you commit indecency while you see
An-Naml,17,-0.3818,0.14,0.86,0.0,what do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than woman nay you are people who act ignorantly
An-Naml,28,0.2617,0.086,0.796,0.118,but the answer of his people wa no other except that they said turn out lut follower from your town surely they are people who would keep pure
An-Naml,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we delivered him and his follower except his wife we ordained her to be of those who remained behind
An-Naml,17,-0.7579,0.302,0.698,0.0,and we rained on them rain and evil wa the rain of those who had been warned
An-Naml,23,0.9081,0.0,0.605,0.395,say praise be to allah and peace on his servant whom he ha chosen is allah better or what they associate with him
An-Naml,52,0.8834,0.0,0.809,0.191,nay he who created the heaven and the earth and sent down for you water from the cloud then we cause to grow thereby beautiful garden it is not possible for you that you should make the tree thereof to grow is there god with allah nay they are people who deviate
An-Naml,35,0.1531,0.041,0.902,0.057,or who made the earth restingplace and made in it river and raised on it mountain and placed between the two sea barrier is there god with allah nay most of them do not know

An-Naml,24,-0.3167,0.185,0.707,0.108,nay their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty nay they are in doubt about it nay they are quite blind to it
An-Naml,21,0.0516,0.093,0.805,0.102,and those who disbelieve say what when we have become dust and our father too shall we certainly be brought forth
An-Naml,19,0.3506,0.0,0.831,0.169,we have certainly been promised this we and our father before these are naught but story of the ancient

Al-Qasas,11,0.3818,0.0,0.794,0.206,these are the verse of the book that make thing clear
Al-Qasas,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,we recite to you from the account of musa and firon with truth for people who believe
Al-Qasas,35,0.836,0.053,0.69,0.257,surely firon exalted himself in the land and made it people into party weakening one party from among them he slaughtered their son and let their woman live surely he wa one of the mischiefmakers
Al-Qasas,27,0.2263,0.091,0.757,0.151,and we desired to bestow favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land and to make them the imam and to make them the heir
Al-Qasas,23,-0.1779,0.12,0.787,0.094,and to grant them power in the land and to make firon and haman and their host see from them what they feared
Al-Qasas,42,-0.9115,0.269,0.731,0.0,and we revealed to musa mother saying give him suck then when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve surely we will bring him back to you and make him one of the apostle
Al-Qasas,25,-0.5859,0.212,0.696,0.092,and firon family took him up that he might be an enemy and grief for them surely firon and haman and their host were wrongdoer
Al-Qasas,36,0.4404,0.0,0.921,0.079,and firon wife said refreshment of the eye to me and to you do not slay him maybe he will be useful to u or we may take him for son and they did not perceive
Al-Qasas,30,0.069,0.117,0.786,0.096,and the heart of musa mother wa free from anxiety she would have almost disclosed it had we not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believer
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to his sister follow him up so she watched him from distance while they did not perceive
Al-Qasas,39,0.4215,0.109,0.745,0.147,and we ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before so she said shall point out to you the people of house who will take care of him for you and they will be benevolent to him
Al-Qasas,39,0.0387,0.081,0.834,0.085,so we gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed and that she might no grieve and that she might know that the promise of allah is true but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,27,0.9001,0.0,0.657,0.343,and when he attained his maturity and became full grown we granted him wisdom and knowledge and thus do we reward those who do good to others
Al-Qasas,82,-0.8952,0.21,0.684,0.106,and he went into the city at time of unvigilance on the part of it people so he found therein two men fighting one being of his party and the other of his foe and he who wa of his party cried out to him for help against him who wa of his enemy so musa struck him with his fist and killed him he said this is on account of the shaitan doing surely he is an enemy openly leading astray
Al-Qasas,26,0.8818,0.092,0.523,0.385,he said my lord surely have done harm to myself so do thou protect me so he protected him surely he is the forgiving the merciful
Al-Qasas,18,-0.0258,0.13,0.744,0.126,he said my lord because thou hast bestowed favor on me shall never be backer of the guilty
Al-Qasas,37,-0.5584,0.155,0.773,0.073,and he wa in the city fearing awaiting when lo he who had asked his assistance the day before wa cry out to him for aid musa said to him you are most surely one erring manifestly
Al-Qasas,52,-0.1945,0.131,0.751,0.118,so when he desired to seize him who wa an enemy to them both he said musa do you intend to kill me a you killed person yesterday you desire nothing but that you should be tyrant in the land and you do not desire to be of those who act aright
Al-Qasas,36,0.8625,0.0,0.751,0.249,and man came running from the remotest part of the city he said musa surely the chief are consulting together to slay you therefore depart at once surely am of those who wish well to you
Al-Qasas,18,-0.7906,0.304,0.696,0.0,so he went forth therefrom fearing awaiting and he said my lord deliver me from the unjust people
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he turned his face towards madyan he said maybe my lord will guide me in the right path
Al-Qasas,58,0.0258,0.0,0.981,0.019,and when he came to the water of madyan he found on it group of men watering and he found besides them two woman keeping back their flock he said what is the matter with you they said we cannot water until the shepherd take away their sheep from the water and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,30,0.7003,0.0,0.828,0.172,so he watered their sheep for them then went back to the shade and said my lord surely stand in need of whatever good thou mayest send down to me
Al-Qasas,53,-0.4653,0.14,0.754,0.106,then one of the two woman came to him walking bashfully she said my father invite you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for u so when he came to him and gave to him the account he said fear not you are secure from the unjust people
Al-Qasas,24,0.9231,0.0,0.601,0.399,said one of them my father employ him surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man the faithful one
Al-Qasas,57,0.8629,0.065,0.744,0.191,he said desire to marry one of these two daughter of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight year but if you complete ten it will be of your own free will and do not wish to be hard to you if allah please you will find me one of the good
Al-Qasas,32,0.5994,0.059,0.777,0.164,he said this shall be an agreement between me and you whichever of the two term fulfill there shall be no wrongdoing to me and allah is witness of what we say
Al-Qasas,50,-0.3612,0.127,0.791,0.083,so when musa had fulfilled the term and he journeyed with his family he perceived on this side of the mountain fire he said to his family wait have seen fire maybe will bring to you from it some news or brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,33,0.7783,0.0,0.82,0.18,and when he came to it voice wa uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush saying musa surely am allah the lord of the world
Al-Qasas,40,-0.4949,0.127,0.818,0.055,and saying cast down you staff so when he saw it in motion a if it were serpent he turned back retreating and did not return musa come forward and fear not surely you are of those who are secure
Al-Qasas,46,0.7973,0.097,0.684,0.219,enter your hand into the opening of your bosom it will come forth white without evil and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear so these two shall be two argument from your lord to firon and his chief surely they are transgressing people
Al-Qasas,16,-0.7728,0.351,0.53,0.118,he said my lord surely killed one of them so fear lest they should slay me
Al-Qasas,28,-0.4588,0.18,0.732,0.088,and my brother haroun he is more eloquent of tongue than therefore send him with me a an aider verifying me surely fear that they would reject me
Al-Qasas,39,0.3666,0.026,0.885,0.089,he said we will strengthen your arm with your brother and we will give you both an authority so that they shall not reach you go with our sign you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost
Al-Qasas,29,0.2023,0.0,0.94,0.06,so when musa came to them with our clear sign they said this is nothing but forged enchantment and we never heard of it amongst our father of old
Al-Qasas,30,0.5615,0.154,0.604,0.242,and musa said my lord know best who come with guidance from him and whose shall be the good end of the abode surely the unjust shall not be successful
Al-Qasas,47,0.1761,0.103,0.762,0.134,and firon said chief do not know of any god for you besides myself therefore kindle fire for me haman for brick then prepare for me lofty building so that may obtain knowledge of musa god and most surely think him to be one of the liar
Al-Qasas,24,0.4767,0.0,0.876,0.124,and he wa unjustly proud in the land he and his host and they deemed that they would not be brought back to u
Al-Qasas,25,-0.5106,0.121,0.879,0.0,so we caught hold of him and his host then we cast them into the sea and see how wa the end of the unjust
Al-Qasas,21,-0.34,0.107,0.893,0.0,and we made them imam who call to the fire and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted
Al-Qasas,25,-0.5423,0.127,0.873,0.0,and we caused curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous
Al-Qasas,27,0.2023,0.162,0.625,0.213,and certainly we gave musa the book after we had destroyed the former generation clear argument for men and guidance and mercy that they may be mindful
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and you were not on the western side when we revealed to musa the commandment and you were not among the witness
Al-Qasas,31,-0.0286,0.036,0.964,0.0,but we raised up generation then life became prolonged to them and you were not dwelling among the people of madyan reciting to them our communication but we were the sender
Al-Qasas,35,-0.0387,0.111,0.807,0.082,and you were not on this side of the mountain when we called but mercy from your lord that you may warn people to whom no warner came before you that they may be mindful
Al-Qasas,45,-0.2263,0.083,0.852,0.065,and were it not that there should befall them disaster for what their hand have sent before then they should say our lord why didst thou not send to u an apostle so that we should have followed thy communication and been of the believer
Al-Qasas,54,0.8663,0.042,0.745,0.212,but now when the truth ha come to them from u they say why is he not given the like of what wa given to musa what did they not disbelieve in what musa wa given before they say two magician backing up each other and they say surely we are unbeliever in all
Al-Qasas,24,0.7096,0.0,0.789,0.211,say then bring some other book from allah which is better guide than both of them that may follow it if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,41,0.8808,0.097,0.639,0.265,but if they do not answer you then know that they only follow their low desire and who is more erring than he who follows his low desire without any guidance from allah surely allah doe not guide the unjust people
Al-Qasas,16,0.3612,0.0,0.8,0.2,and certainly we have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful
Al-Qasas,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a to those whom we gave the book before it they are believer in it
Al-Qasas,27,0.7964,0.0,0.748,0.252,and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it surely it is the truth from our lord surely we were submitter before this
Al-Qasas,26,0.6369,0.122,0.583,0.294,these shall be granted their reward twice because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what we have given them
Al-Qasas,34,0.4689,0.059,0.804,0.138,and when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say we shall have our deed and you shall have your deed peace be on you we do not desire the ignorant
Al-Qasas,23,0.8847,0.0,0.659,0.341,surely you cannot guide whom you love but allah guide whom he plea and he know best the follower of the right way
Al-Qasas,47,0.4854,0.0,0.914,0.086,and they say if we follow the guidance with you we shall be carried off from our country what have we not settled them in safe sacred territory to which fruit of every kind shall be drawn sustenance from u but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,34,-0.4939,0.088,0.912,0.0,and how many town have we destroyed which exulted in it mean of subsistence so these are their abode they have not been dwelt in after them except little and we are the inheritor
Al-Qasas,32,0.2396,0.088,0.772,0.14,and your lord never destroyed the town until he raised in their metropolis an apostle reciting to them our communication and we never destroyed the town except when their people were unjust
Al-Qasas,32,0.6369,0.0,0.852,0.148,and whatever thing you have been given are only provision of this world life and it adornment and whatever is with allah is better and more lasting do you not then understand
Al-Qasas,42,0.743,0.0,0.842,0.158,is he to whom we have promised goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom we have provided with the provision of this world life then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up
Al-Qasas,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and on the day when he will call them and say where are those whom you deemed to be my associate
Al-Qasas,44,0.6486,0.0,0.861,0.139,those against whom the sentence ha become confirmed will say our lord these are they whom we caused to err we caused them to err a we ourselves did err to thee we declare ourselves to be clear of them they never served u
Al-Qasas,35,-0.5789,0.111,0.849,0.04,and it will be said call your associate god so they will call upon them but they will not answer them and they shall see the punishment would that they had followed the right way
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and on the day when he shall call them and say what wa the answer you gave to the apostle
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the plea shall become obscure to them on that day so they shall not ask each other
Al-Qasas,18,0.8765,0.0,0.624,0.376,but a to him who repents and belief and doe good maybe he will be among the successful
Al-Qasas,28,-0.1901,0.092,0.84,0.068,and your lord creates and chooses whom he plea to choose is not theirs glory be to allah and exalted be he above what they associate with him
Al-Qasas,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and your lord know what their breast conceal and what they manifest
Al-Qasas,35,0.705,0.04,0.799,0.161,and he is allah there is no god but he all praise is due to him in this life and the hereafter and his is the judgment and to him you shall be brought back
Al-Qasas,36,0.2732,0.0,0.943,0.057,say tell me if allah were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection who is the god besides allah that could bring you light do you not then hear
Al-Qasas,42,0.2732,0.0,0.951,0.049,say tell me if allah were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection who is the god besides allah that could bring you the night in which you take rest do you not then see
Al-Qasas,34,0.8625,0.0,0.739,0.261,and out of his mercy he ha made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of his grace and that you may give thanks
Al-Qasas,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and on the day when he shall call them and say where are those whom you deemed to be my associate
Al-Qasas,33,0.3182,0.0,0.933,0.067,and we will draw forth from among every nation witness and say bring your proof then shall they know that the truth is allah and that which they forged shall depart from them
Al-Qasas,56,0.9389,0.137,0.552,0.311,surely qaroun wa of the people of musa but he rebelled against them and we had given him of the treasure so much so that his hoard of wealth would certainly weigh down company of men possessed of great strength when his people said to him do not exult surely allah doe not love the exultant
Al-Qasas,52,0.7658,0.126,0.633,0.241,and seek by mean of what allah ha given you the future abode and do not neglect your portion of this world and do good to others a allah ha done good to you and do not seek to make mischief in the land surely allah doe not love the mischief maker
Al-Qasas,48,-0.4588,0.152,0.749,0.099,he said have been given this only on account of the knowledge have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him of the generation those who were mightier in strength than he and greater in assemblage and the guilty shall not be asked about their fault
Al-Qasas,37,0.8832,0.0,0.745,0.255,so he went forth to his people in his finery those who desire this world life said would that we had the like of what qaroun is given most surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune
Al-Qasas,32,0.7717,0.069,0.695,0.236,and those who were given the knowledge said woe to you allah reward is better for him who belief and doe good and none is made to receive this except the patient
Al-Qasas,33,-0.0164,0.069,0.864,0.067,thus we made the earth to swallow up him and his abode so he had no body of helper to assist him against allah nor wa he of those who can defend themselves
Al-Qasas,54,-0.7006,0.149,0.797,0.053,and those who yearned for his place only the day before began to say ah know that allah amplifies and straitens the mean of subsistence for whom he plea of his servant had not allah been gracious to u he would most surely have abased u ah know that the ungrateful are never successful
Al-Qasas,35,0.0284,0.152,0.67,0.178,a for that future abode we assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard against evil
Al-Qasas,27,-0.7669,0.291,0.561,0.148,whoever brings good he shall have better than it and whoever brings evil those who do evil shall not be rewarded for aught except what they did
Al-Qasas,36,0.8588,0.059,0.675,0.266,most surely he who ha made the quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination say my lord know best him who ha brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error
Al-Qasas,28,0.6542,0.0,0.829,0.171,and you did not expect that the book would be inspired to you but it is mercy from your lord therefore be not backer up of the unbeliever
Al-Qasas,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and let them not turn you aside from the communication of allah after they have been revealed to you and call men to your lord and be not of the polytheist
Al-Qasas,32,0.128,0.047,0.861,0.092,and call not with allah any other god there is no god but he every thing is perishable but he his is the judgment and to him you shall be brought back
Al-Ankabut,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,alif lam mim
Al-Ankabut,17,-0.25,0.111,0.889,0.0,do men think that they will be left alone on saying we believe and not be tried
Al-Ankabut,23,0.6908,0.105,0.575,0.319,and certainly we tried those before them so allah will certainly know those who are true and he will certainly know the liar
Al-Ankabut,18,-0.8442,0.359,0.571,0.069,or do they who work evil think that they will escape u evil is it that they judge
Al-Ankabut,22,0.7264,0.0,0.766,0.234,whoever hope to meet allah the term appointed by allah will then most surely come and he is the hearing the knowing
Al-Ankabut,22,0.4201,0.057,0.813,0.13,and whoever strives hard he strives only for his own soul most surely allah is self sufficient above need of the world
Al-Ankabut,32,0.9014,0.096,0.545,0.359,and a for those who believe and do good we will most certainly do away with their evil deed and we will most certainly reward them the best of what they did
Al-Ankabut,46,0.25,0.045,0.87,0.085,and we have enjoined on man goodness to his parent and if they contend with you that you should associate others with me of which you have no knowledge do not obey them to me is your return so will inform you of what you did
Al-Ankabut,20,0.8399,0.0,0.64,0.36,and a for those who believe and do good we will most surely cause them to enter among the good
Al-Ankabut,67,0.0729,0.097,0.802,0.101,and among men is he who say we believe in allah but when he is persecuted in the way of allah he think the persecution of men to be a the chastisement of allah and if there come assistance from your lord they would most certainly say surely we were with you what is not allah the best knower of what is in the breast of mankind
Al-Ankabut,17,0.6582,0.0,0.736,0.264,and most certainly allah will know those who believe and most certainly he will know the hypocrite
Al-Ankabut,35,-0.818,0.261,0.668,0.071,and those who disbelieve say to those who believe follow our path and we will bear your wrong and never shall they be the bearer of any of their wrong most surely they are liar
Al-Ankabut,32,-0.5739,0.249,0.617,0.133,and most certainly they shall carry their own burden and other burden with their own burden and most certainly they shall be questioned on the resurrection day a to what they forged
Al-Ankabut,27,0.3182,0.1,0.729,0.17,and certainly we sent nuh to his people so he remained among them thousand year save fifty year and the deluge overtook them while they were unjust
Al-Ankabut,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we delivered him and the inmate of the ark and made it sign to the nation
Al-Ankabut,30,0.4404,0.0,0.878,0.122,and we sent ibrahim when he said to his people serve allah and be careful of your duty to him this is best for you if you did but know
Al-Ankabut,45,0.8481,0.0,0.801,0.199,you only worship idol besides allah and you create lie surely they whom you serve besides allah do not control for you any sustenance therefore seek the sustenance from allah and serve him and be grateful to him to him you shall be brought back
Al-Ankabut,27,-0.1027,0.123,0.767,0.11,and if you reject the truth nation before you did indeed reject the truth and nothing is incumbent on the apostle but plain delivering of the message
Al-Ankabut,19,0.7845,0.0,0.669,0.331,what do they not consider how allah originates the creation then reproduces it surely that is easy to allah
Al-Ankabut,26,0.8625,0.0,0.644,0.356,say travel in the earth and see how he make the first creation then allah creates the latter creation surely allah ha power over all thing
Al-Ankabut,20,0.2023,0.124,0.68,0.196,he punishes whom he plea and ha mercy on whom he plea and to him you shall be turned back
Al-Ankabut,21,-0.3513,0.176,0.75,0.074,and you shall not escape in the earth nor in the heaven and you have neither protector nor helper besides allah

As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we called out to him saying ibrahim

As-Saaffaat,12,0.5448,0.0,0.758,0.242,when he said to his people do you not guard against evil
As-Saaffaat,13,0.6369,0.0,0.741,0.259,what do you call upon ba and forsake the best of the creator

As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but not the servant of allah the purified one
As-Saaffaat,10,0.5574,0.0,0.714,0.286,and we perpetuated to him praise among the later generation
As-Saaffaat,4,0.5423,0.0,0.462,0.538,peace be on ilyas

As-Saaffaat,5,-0.4939,0.444,0.556,0.0,then we destroyed the others
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4927,0.0,0.738,0.262,and most surely you pas by them in the morning
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and at night do you not then understand
As-Saaffaat,8,0.4927,0.0,0.687,0.313,and yunus wa most surely of the apostle
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when he ran away to ship completely laden
As-Saaffaat,13,0.2118,0.0,0.867,0.133,so he shared with them but wa of those who are cast off
As-Saaffaat,14,-0.4767,0.193,0.807,0.0,so the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself
As-Saaffaat,13,0.7227,0.0,0.685,0.315,but had it not been that he wa of those who glorify u
As-Saaffaat,15,0.34,0.0,0.854,0.146,he would certainly have tarried in it belly to the day when they are raised
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,then we cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he wa sick
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we caused to grow up for him gourdplant
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent him to hundred thousand rather they exceeded

As-Saaffaat,12,0.34,0.0,0.821,0.179,then ask them whether your lord ha daughter and they have son
As-Saaffaat,11,0.2732,0.0,0.826,0.174,or did we create the angel female while they were witness
As-Saaffaat,11,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,now surely it is of their own lie that they say
As-Saaffaat,9,0.3167,0.222,0.403,0.376,allah ha begotten and most surely they are liar

As-Saaffaat,22,0.6486,0.0,0.791,0.209,and they assert relationship between him and the jinni and certainly the jinni do know that they shall surely be brought up
As-Saaffaat,10,0.8271,0.0,0.51,0.49,glory be to allah for freedom from what they describe
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but not so the servant of allah the purified one

As-Saaffaat,12,-0.4215,0.203,0.797,0.0,but now they disbelieve in it so they will come to know
As-Saaffaat,15,0.7845,0.0,0.603,0.397,and certainly our word ha already gone forth in respect of our servant the apostle
As-Saaffaat,8,0.4927,0.0,0.687,0.313,most surely they shall be the assisted one
As-Saaffaat,11,0.2944,0.141,0.634,0.225,and most surely our host alone shall be the victorious one

Al-Ahqaaf,42,-0.7269,0.138,0.862,0.0,so when they saw it a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valley they said this is cloud which will give u rain nay it is what you sought to hasten on blast of wind in which is painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,27,-0.3818,0.187,0.673,0.14,destroying everything by the command of it lord so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwelling thus do we reward the guilty people
Al-Ahqaaf,51,-0.7269,0.12,0.85,0.03,and certainly we had established them in what we have not established you in and we had given them ear and eye and heart but neither their ear nor their eye nor their heart availed them aught since they denied the communication of allah and that which they mocked encompassed them
Al-Ahqaaf,19,-0.2023,0.142,0.752,0.106,and certainly we destroyed the town which are around you and we repeat the communication that they might turn
Al-Ahqaaf,35,-0.3523,0.118,0.828,0.054,why did not then those help them whom they took for god besides allah to draw them nigh to him nay they were lost to them and this wa their lie and what they forged
Al-Ahqaaf,38,0.0772,0.058,0.876,0.066,and when we turned towards you party of the jinni who listened to the quran so when they came to it they said be silent then when it wa finished they turned back to their people warning them
Al-Ahqaaf,26,0.3182,0.0,0.916,0.084,they said our people we have listened to book revealed after musa verifying that which is before it guiding to the truth and to right path
Al-Ahqaaf,23,0.2732,0.246,0.448,0.305,our people accept the divine caller and believe in him he will forgive you of your fault and protect you from painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,28,-0.8088,0.28,0.72,0.0,and whoever doe not accept the divine caller he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardian besides him these are in manifest error
Al-Ahqaaf,36,0.8319,0.089,0.599,0.312,have they not considered that allah who created the heaven and the earth and wa not tired by their creation is able to give life to the dead aye he ha surely power over all thing

Al-Ahqaaf,62,-0.8251,0.162,0.801,0.036,therefore bear up patiently a did the apostle endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them their doom on the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be a if they had not tarried save an hour of the day sufficient exposition shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people
Muhammad,17,-0.4019,0.209,0.791,0.0,a for those who disbelieve and turn away from allah way he shall render their work ineffective
Muhammad,38,0.659,0.093,0.678,0.229,and a for those who believe and do good and believe in what ha been revealed to muhammad and it is the very truth from their lord he will remove their evil from them and improve their condition
Muhammad,49,-0.7783,0.185,0.767,0.049,that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and have given them their dowry taking them in marriage not fornicating nor taking them for paramour in secret and whoever denies faith his work indeed is of no account and in the hereafter he shall be one of the loser
Muhammad,93,-0.2263,0.107,0.795,0.098,so when you meet in battle those who disbelieve then smite the neck until when you have overcome them then make them prisoner and afterwards either set them free a favor or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates that shall be so and if allah had pleased he would certainly have exacted what is due from them but that he may try some of you by mean of others and a for those who are slain in the way of allah he will by no mean allow their deed to perish
Muhammad,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,he will guide them and improve their condition
Muhammad,14,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,and cause them to enter the garden which he ha made known to them

Muhammad,14,-0.6369,0.244,0.756,0.0,that is because they hated what allah revealed so he rendered their deed null
Muhammad,33,-0.296,0.099,0.833,0.067,have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how wa the end of those before them allah brought down destruction upon them and the unbeliever shall have the like of it
Muhammad,21,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,that is because allah is the protector of those who believe and because the unbeliever shall have no protector for them
Muhammad,34,0.6597,0.111,0.673,0.216,surely allah will make those who believe and do good enter garden beneath which river flow and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat a the beast eat and the fire is their abode
Muhammad,29,0.3025,0.151,0.639,0.21,and how many town which wa far more powerful than the town of yours which ha driven you out we destroyed them so there wa no helper for them
Muhammad,28,0.0516,0.224,0.522,0.254,what is he who ha clear argument from his lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming and they follow their low desire
Muhammad,79,0.2263,0.076,0.827,0.097,parable of the garden which those guarding against evil are promised therein are river of water that doe not alter and river of milk the taste whereof doe not change and river of drink delicious to those who drink and river of honey clarified and for them therein are all fruit and protection from their lord are these like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowel asunder
Muhammad,53,0.4588,0.037,0.874,0.089,and there are those of them who seek to listen to you until when they go forth from you they say to those who have been given the knowledge what wa it that he said just now these are they upon whose heart allah ha set seal and they follow their low desire
Muhammad,21,-0.4767,0.178,0.729,0.093,and a for those who follow the right direction he increase them in guidance and give them their guarding against evil
Muhammad,39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should come to them all of sudden now indeed the token of it have already come but how shall they have their reminder when it come on them
Muhammad,38,-0.5574,0.124,0.839,0.037,so know that there is no god but allah and ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing woman and allah know the place of your returning and the place of your abiding
Muhammad,46,-0.882,0.214,0.715,0.071,and those who believe say why ha not chapter been revealed but when decisive chapter is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose heart is disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death woe to them then
Muhammad,26,0.9118,0.0,0.636,0.364,obedience and gentle word wa proper but when the affair becomes settled then if they remain true to allah it would certainly be better for them
Muhammad,21,-0.4497,0.22,0.67,0.11,but if you held command you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the tie of kinship
Muhammad,17,0.5859,0.0,0.758,0.242,those it is whom allah ha cursed so he ha made them deaf and blinded their eye
Muhammad,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they not then reflect on the quran nay on the heart there are lock
Muhammad,31,0.7783,0.0,0.747,0.253,surely a for those who return on their back after that guidance ha become manifest to them the shaitan ha made it light matter to them and he give them respite
Muhammad,27,-0.3182,0.119,0.804,0.077,that is because they say to those who hate what allah ha revealed we will obey you in some of the affair and allah know their secret
Muhammad,15,-0.7469,0.276,0.724,0.0,but how will it be when the angel cause them to die smiting their back
Muhammad,23,0.7269,0.0,0.775,0.225,that is because they follow what is displeasing to allah and are averse to his pleasure therefore he ha made null their deed
Muhammad,17,-0.5267,0.175,0.825,0.0,or do those in whose heart is disease think that allah will not bring forth their spite
Muhammad,40,0.7269,0.0,0.839,0.161,and if we please we would have made you know them so that you would certainly have recognized them by their mark and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of their speech and allah know your deed
Muhammad,26,0.3167,0.05,0.854,0.096,and most certainly we will try you until we have known those among you who exert themselves hard and the patient and made your case manifest

Muhammad,33,0.1779,0.109,0.741,0.151,the life of this world is only idle sport and play and if you believe and guard against evil he will give you your reward and will not ask of you your possession
Muhammad,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if he should ask you for it and urge you you will be niggardly and he will bring forth your malice
Muhammad,62,-0.395,0.042,0.958,0.0,behold you are those who are called upon to spend in allah way but among you are those who are niggardly and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul and allah is self sufficient and you have need of him and if you turn back he will bring in your place another people then they will not be like you

An-Najm,13,-0.1761,0.205,0.629,0.166,and the people of nuh before surely they were most unjust and inordinate
An-Najm,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the overthrown city did he overthrow
An-Najm,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so there covered them that which covered

An-Najm,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,there shall be none besides allah to remove it
An-Najm,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do you then wonder at this announcement
An-Najm,7,0.7648,0.0,0.431,0.569,and will you laugh and not weep
An-Najm,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,while you are indulging in variety
An-Najm,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so make obeisance to allah and serve him

Al-Qamar,12,0.5859,0.0,0.743,0.257,and if they see miracle they turn aside and say transient magic
Al-Qamar,17,0.4588,0.099,0.66,0.241,and they call it lie and follow their low desire and every affair ha it appointed term
Al-Qamar,11,0.34,0.0,0.806,0.194,and certainly some narrative have come to them wherein is prevention
Al-Qamar,7,-0.2263,0.301,0.485,0.214,consummate wisdom but warning do not avail
Al-Qamar,18,0.0516,0.074,0.842,0.084,so turn your back on them for the day when the inviter shall invite them to hard task

Al-Hadeed,82,-0.0644,0.084,0.812,0.104,know that this world life is only sport and play and gaiety and boasting among yourselves and vying in the multiplication of wealth and child like the rain whose causing the vegetation to grow plea the husbandman then it withers away so that you will see it become yellow then it becomes dried up and broken down and in the hereafter is severe chastisement and also forgiveness from allah and his pleasure and this world life is naught but mean of deception
Al-Hadeed,56,0.8979,0.0,0.795,0.205,hasten to forgiveness from your lord and to garden the extensiveness of which is a the extensiveness of the heaven and the earth it is prepared for those who believe in allah and his apostle that is the grace of allah he give it to whom he plea and allah is the lord of mighty grace
Al-Hadeed,28,0.6597,0.119,0.667,0.214,no evil befalls on the earth nor in your own soul but it is in book before we bring it into existence surely that is easy to allah
Al-Hadeed,28,0.2556,0.172,0.576,0.252,so that you may not grieve for what ha escaped you nor be exultant at what he ha given you and allah doe not love any arrogant boaster
Al-Hadeed,24,0.7269,0.0,0.783,0.217,those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on men and whoever turn back then surely allah is he who is the selfsufficient the praised
Al-Hadeed,58,0.9081,0.087,0.648,0.265,certainly we sent our apostle with clear argument and sent down with them the book and the balance that men may conduct themselves with equity and we have made the iron wherein is great violence and advantage to men and that allah may know who help him and his apostle in the secret surely allah is strong mighty
Al-Hadeed,35,0.6486,0.0,0.862,0.138,and certainly we sent nuh and ibrahim and we gave to their offspring the gift of prophecy and the book so there are among them those who go aright and most of them are transgressor
Al-Hadeed,84,0.8793,0.0,0.876,0.124,then we made our apostle to follow in their footstep and we sent isa son of marium afterwards and we gave him the injeel and we put in the heart of those who followed him kindness and mercy and a for monkery they innovated it we did not prescribe it to them only to seek allah pleasure but they did not observe it with it due observance so we gave to those of them who believed their reward and most of them are transgressor
Al-Hadeed,42,0.7964,0.0,0.807,0.193,you who believe be careful of your duty to allah and believe in his apostle he will give you two portion of his mercy and make for you light with which you will walk and forgive you and allah is forgiving merciful
Al-Hadeed,42,0.891,0.0,0.766,0.234,so that the follower of the book may know that they do not control aught of the grace of allah and that grace is in allah hand he give it to whom he plea and allah is the lord of mighty grace
Al-Mujadila,32,0.0772,0.073,0.845,0.082,allah indeed know the plea of her who pleads with you about her husband and complains to allah and allah know the contention of both of you surely allah is hearing seeing
Al-Mujadila,52,0.764,0.087,0.721,0.192,a for those of you who put away their wife by likening their back to the back of their mother they are not their mother their mother are no others than those who gave them birth and most surely they utter hateful word and falsehood and most surely allah is pardoning forgiving
Al-Mujadila,49,0.1027,0.056,0.881,0.063,and a for those who put away their wife by likening their back to the back of their mother then would recall what they said they should free captive before they touch each other to that you are admonished to conform and allah is aware of what you do
Al-Mujadila,58,-0.4767,0.158,0.714,0.128,but whoever ha not the mean let him fast for two month successively before they touch each other then a for him who is not able let him feed sixty needy one that is in order that you may have faith in allah and his apostle and these are allah limit and the unbeliever shall have painful punishment
