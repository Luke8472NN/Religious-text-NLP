Al-Araf,38,-0.7288,0.169,0.831,0.0,he said punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your lord dispute ye with me over name which ye have devised ye and your father without authority from allah then wait am amongst you also waiting
Al-Araf,28,-0.0258,0.156,0.692,0.153,we saved him and those who adhered to him by our mercy and we cut off the root of those who rejected our sign and did not believe
Al-Araf,67,-0.9303,0.231,0.691,0.078,to the thamud people we sent salih one of their own brother he said my people worship allah ye have no other god but him now hath come unto you clear sign from your lord this she camel of allah is sign unto you so leave her to graze in allah earth and let her come to no harm or ye shall be seized with grievous punishment
Al-Araf,55,-0.5994,0.111,0.84,0.048,and remember how he made you inheritor after the ad people and gave you habitation in the land ye build for yourselves palace and castle in open plain and carve out home in the mountain so bring to remembrance the benefit ye have received from allah and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth
Al-Araf,46,-0.5719,0.123,0.825,0.052,the leader of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless those among them who believed know ye indeed that salih is messenger from his lord they said we do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him
Al-Araf,13,-0.4939,0.317,0.538,0.145,the arrogant party said for our part we reject what ye believe in
Al-Araf,27,-0.5267,0.116,0.884,0.0,then they ham strung the she camel and insolently defied the order of their lord saying salih bring about thy threat if thou art messenger of allah
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the earthquake took them unawares and they lay prostrate in their home in the morning
Al-Araf,31,0.9118,0.0,0.707,0.293,so salih left them saying my people did indeed convey to you the message for which wa sent by my lord gave you good counsel but ye love not good counsellor
Al-Araf,23,0.4939,0.083,0.677,0.241,we also sent lut he said to his people do ye commit lewdness such a no people in creation ever committed before you
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for ye practise your lust on men in preference to woman ye are indeed people transgressing beyond bound
Al-Araf,27,0.5267,0.052,0.784,0.163,and his people gave no answer but this they said drive them out of your city these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure
Al-Araf,17,0.5719,0.0,0.812,0.188,but we saved him and his family except his wife she wa of those who legged behind
Al-Araf,23,-0.7964,0.253,0.747,0.0,and we rained down on them shower of brimstone then see what wa the end of those who indulged in sin and crime
Al-Araf,76,0.91,0.082,0.714,0.204,to the madyan people we sent shu aib one of their own brother he said my people worship allah ye have no other god but him now hath come unto you clear sign from your lord give just measure and weight nor withhold from the people the thing that are their due and do no mischief on the earth after it ha been set in order that will be best for you if ye have faith
Al-Araf,51,-0.3612,0.097,0.851,0.052,and squat not on every road breathing threat hindering from the path of allah those who believe in him and seeking in it something crooked but remember how ye were little and he gave you increase and hold in your mind eye what wa the end of those who did mischief
Al-Araf,40,0.8625,0.0,0.789,0.211,and if there is party among you who belief in the message with which have been sent and party which doe not believe hold yourselves in patience until allah doth decide between u for he is the best to decide
Al-Araf,51,0.2263,0.057,0.853,0.091,the leader the arrogant party among his people said shu aib we shall certainly drive thee out of our city thee and those who believe with thee or else ye thou and they shall have to return to our way and religion he said what even though we do detest them
Al-Araf,80,0.9136,0.0,0.84,0.16,we should indeed invent lie against allah if we returned to your way after allah hath rescued u therefrom nor could we by any manner of mean return thereto unless it be a in the will and plan of allah our lord our lord can reach out to the utmost recess of thing by his knowledge in the allah is our trust our lord decide thou between u and our people in truth for thou art the best to decide
Al-Araf,19,-0.2023,0.138,0.759,0.103,the leader the unbeliever among his people said if ye follow shu aib be sure then ye are ruined
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but the earthquake took them unawares and they lay prostrate in their home before the morning
Al-Araf,32,-0.8442,0.245,0.755,0.0,the men who reject shu aib became a if they had never been in the home where they had flourished the men who rejected shu aib it wa they who were ruined
Al-Araf,36,-0.705,0.163,0.79,0.047,so shu aib left them saying my people did indeed convey to you the message for which wa sent by my lord gave you good counsel but how shall lament over people who refuse to believe
Al-Araf,22,-0.7096,0.228,0.772,0.0,whenever we sent prophet to town we took up it people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility
Al-Araf,39,-0.6049,0.139,0.81,0.051,then we changed their suffering into prosperity until they grew and multiplied and began to say our father too were touched by suffering and affluence behold we called them to account of sudden while they realised not their peril
Al-Araf,42,0.3634,0.153,0.649,0.198,if the people of the town had but believed and feared allah we should indeed have opened out to them all kind of blessing from heaven and earth but they rejected the truth and we brought them to book for their misdeed
Al-Araf,20,0.34,0.0,0.888,0.112,did the people of the town feel secure against the coming of our wrath by night while they were asleep
Al-Araf,18,0.8834,0.0,0.553,0.447,or else did they feel secure against it coming in broad daylight while they played about care free
Al-Araf,26,-0.9001,0.348,0.53,0.121,did they then feel secure against the plan of allah but no one can feel secure from the plan of allah except those doomed to ruin
Al-Araf,41,-0.7351,0.15,0.812,0.038,to those who inherit the earth in succession to it previous possessor is it not guiding lesson that if we so willed we could punish them too for their sin and seal up their heart so that they could not hear
Al-Araf,43,-0.5423,0.152,0.743,0.105,such were the town whose story we thus relate unto thee there came indeed to them their messenger with clear sign but they would not believe what they had rejected before thus doth allah seal up the heart of those who reject faith
Al-Araf,20,-0.5371,0.199,0.801,0.0,most of them we found not men true to their covenant but most of them we found rebellious and disobedient
Al-Araf,30,-0.8271,0.216,0.784,0.0,then after them we sent moses with our sign to pharaoh and his chief but they wrongfully rejected them so see what wa the end of those who made mischief
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said pharaoh am messenger from the lord of the world
Al-Araf,35,0.2399,0.063,0.85,0.088,one for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about allah now have come unto you people from your lord with clear sign so let the child of israel depart along with me
Al-Araf,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,pharaoh said if indeed thou hast come with sign show it forth if thou tellest the truth
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then moses threw his rod and behold it wa serpent plain for all to see
Al-Araf,14,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198,and he drew out his hand and behold it wa white to all beholder
Al-Araf,14,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,said the chief of the people of pharaoh this is indeed sorcerer well versed
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,his plan is to get you out of your land then what is it ye counsel
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said keep him and his brother in suspense for while and send to the city men to collect
Al-Araf,10,0.2732,0.0,0.811,0.189,and bring up to thee all our sorcerer well versed
Al-Araf,19,0.8176,0.0,0.694,0.306,so there came the sorcerer to pharaoh they said of course we shall have suitable reward if we win
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said yea and more for ye shall in that case be raised to post nearest to my person
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses wilt thou throw first or shall we have the first throw
Al-Araf,28,-0.0772,0.157,0.725,0.119,said moses throw ye first so when they threw they bewitched the eye of the people and struck terror into them for they showed great feat of magic
Al-Araf,25,0.296,0.102,0.724,0.174,we put it into moses mind by inspiration throw now thy rod and behold it swallow up straight away all the falsehood which they fake
Al-Araf,14,0.0258,0.133,0.727,0.139,thus truth wa confirmed and all that they did wa made of no effect
Al-Araf,15,0.6573,0.0,0.762,0.238,so the great one were vanquished there and then and were made to look small
Al-Araf,8,0.7469,0.0,0.567,0.433,but the sorcerer fell down prostrate in adoration
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,saying we believe in the lord of the world
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,33,0.2144,0.032,0.91,0.057,said pharaoh believe ye in him before give you permission surely this is trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out it people but soon shall ye know the consequence
Al-Araf,23,-0.128,0.197,0.623,0.18,be sure will cut off your hand and your foot on apposite side and will cause you all to die on the cross
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said for u we are but sent back unto our lord
Al-Araf,44,0.1531,0.0,0.961,0.039,but thou dost wreak thy vengeance on u simply because we believed in the sign of our lord when they reached u our lord pour out on u patience and constancy and take our soul unto thee a muslim who bow to thy will
Al-Araf,48,0.5719,0.114,0.708,0.178,said the chief of pharaoh people wilt thou leave moses and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon thee and thy god he said their male child will we slay only their female will we save alive and we have over them power irresistible
Al-Araf,41,0.8481,0.0,0.796,0.204,said moses to his people pray for help from allah and wait in patience and constancy for the earth is allah to give a heritage to such of his servant a he pleaseth and the end is best for the righteous
Al-Araf,44,-0.8231,0.181,0.764,0.055,they said we have had nothing but trouble both before and after thou camest to u he said it may be that your lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritor in the earth that so he may try you by your deed
Al-Araf,19,-0.4588,0.143,0.857,0.0,we punished the people of pharaoh with year of drought and shortness of crop that they might receive admonition
Al-Araf,48,-0.8126,0.197,0.694,0.11,but when good time came they said this is due to u when gripped by calamity they ascribed it to evil omen connected with moses and those with him behold in truth the omen of evil are theirs in allah sight but most of them do not understand
Al-Araf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said to moses whatever be the sign thou bringest to work therewith thy sorcery on u we shall never believe in thee
Al-Araf,27,-0.9294,0.374,0.626,0.0,so we sent plague on them wholesale death locust louse frog and blood sign openly self explained but they were steeped in arrogance people given to sin
Al-Araf,49,0.25,0.105,0.754,0.14,every time the penalty fell on them they said moses on your behalf call on thy lord in virtue of his promise to thee if thou wilt remove the penalty from u we shall truly believe in thee and we shall send away the child of israel with thee

Yusuf,33,0.6361,0.0,0.884,0.116,we do relate unto thee the most beautiful of story in that we reveal to thee this portion of the qur an before this thou too wa among those who knew it not
Yusuf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,behold joseph said to his father my father did see eleven star and the sun and the moon saw them prostrate themselves to me
Yusuf,28,-0.3899,0.16,0.761,0.079,said the father my dear little son relate not thy vision to thy brother lest they concoct plot against thee for satan is to man an avowed enemy
Yusuf,47,0.9287,0.0,0.754,0.246,thus will thy lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of story and event and perfect his favour to thee and to the posterity of jacob even a he perfected it to thy father abraham and isaac aforetime for allah is full of knowledge and wisdom
Yusuf,14,0.3182,0.0,0.85,0.15,verily in joseph and his brother are sign or symbol for seeker after truth
Yusuf,29,0.5267,0.0,0.86,0.14,they said truly joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we but we are goodly body really our father is obviously wandering in his mind
Yusuf,36,0.2911,0.051,0.868,0.081,slay ye joseph or cast him out to some unknown land that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone there will be time enough for you to be righteous after that
Yusuf,32,0.3919,0.0,0.921,0.079,said one of them slay not joseph but if ye must do something throw him down to the bottom of the well he will be picked up by some caravan of traveller
Yusuf,20,0.2728,0.115,0.681,0.204,they said our father why dost thou not trust u with joseph seeing we are indeed his sincere well wishers
Yusuf,18,0.8316,0.0,0.614,0.386,send him with u tomorrow to enjoy himself and play and we shall take every care of him
Yusuf,25,-0.749,0.217,0.783,0.0,jacob said really it saddens me that ye should take him away fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him
Yusuf,23,0.4549,0.0,0.881,0.119,they said if the wolf were to devour him while we are so large party then should we indeed first have perished ourselves
Yusuf,47,0.7579,0.0,0.835,0.165,so they did take him away and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well and we put into his heart this message of surety thou shalt one day tell them the truth of this their affair while they know thee not
Yusuf,14,-0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,then they came to their father in the early part of the night weeping
Yusuf,33,0.4497,0.0,0.913,0.087,they said our father we went racing with one another and left joseph with our thing and the wolf devoured him but thou wilt never believe u even though we tell the truth
Yusuf,42,0.2617,0.054,0.869,0.077,they stained his shirt with false blood he said nay but your mind have made up tale that may pas with you for me patience is most fitting against that which ye assert it is allah alone whose help can be sought
Yusuf,47,0.7311,0.0,0.818,0.182,then there came caravan of traveller they sent their water carrier for water and he let down his bucket into the well he said ah there good news here is fine young man so they concealed him a treasure but allah knoweth well all that they do
Yusuf,20,-0.6486,0.227,0.773,0.0,the brother sold him for miserable price for few dirham counted out in such low estimation did they hold him
Yusuf,68,0.5187,0.0,0.921,0.079,the man in egypt who bought him said to his wife make his stay among u honourable may be he will bring u much good or we shall adopt him a son thus did we establish joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of story and event and allah hath full power and control over his affair but most among mankind know it not
Yusuf,20,0.5719,0.0,0.837,0.163,when joseph attained his full manhood we gave him power and knowledge thus do we reward those who do right
Yusuf,50,0.9253,0.135,0.56,0.305,but she in whose house he wa sought to seduce him from his true self she fastened the door and said now come thou dear one he said allah forbid truly thy husband is my lord he made my sojourn agreeable truly to no good come those who do wrong
Yusuf,48,-0.6652,0.17,0.685,0.146,and with passion did she desire him and he would have desired her but that he saw the evidence of his lord thus did we order that we might turn away from him all evil and shameful deed for he wa one of our servant sincere and purified
Yusuf,47,-0.9224,0.236,0.764,0.0,so they both raced each other to the door and she tore his shirt from the back they both found her lord near the door she said what is the fitting punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife but prison or grievous chastisement
Yusuf,45,0.0772,0.102,0.79,0.108,he said it wa she that sought to seduce me from my true self and one of her household saw this and bore witness thus if it be that his shirt is rent from the front then is her tale true and he is liar
Yusuf,23,-0.6124,0.232,0.669,0.099,but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back then is she the liar and he is telling the truth
Yusuf,28,0.2263,0.065,0.841,0.094,so when he saw his shirt that it wa torn at the back her husband said behold it is snare of you woman truly mighty is your snare
Yusuf,17,-0.3182,0.259,0.535,0.206,joseph pas this over wife ask forgiveness for thy sin for truly thou hast been at fault
Yusuf,36,0.9231,0.076,0.587,0.337,lady said in the city the wife of the great aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his true self truly hath he inspired her with violent love we see she is evidently going astray
Yusuf,62,0.4253,0.096,0.781,0.122,when she heard of their malicious talk she sent for them and prepared banquet for them she gave each of them knife and she said to joseph come out before them when they saw him they did extol him and in their amazement cut their hand they said allah preserve u no mortal is this this is none other than noble angel
Yusuf,56,0.6542,0.091,0.739,0.17,she said there before you is the man about whom ye did blame me did seek to seduce him from his true self but he did firmly save himself guiltless and now if he doth not my bidding he shall certainly be cast into prison and what is more be of the company of the vilest
Yusuf,42,0.3947,0.107,0.713,0.18,he said my lord the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me unless thou turn away their snare from me should in my youthful folly feel inclined towards them and join the rank of the ignorant
Yusuf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord hearkened to him in his prayer and turned away from him their snare verily he heareth and knoweth all thing
Yusuf,21,0.6369,0.0,0.826,0.174,then it occurred to the men after they had seen the sign that it wa best to imprison him for time
Yusuf,58,0.5994,0.051,0.806,0.143,now with him there came into the prison two young men said one of them see myself in dream pressing wine said the other see myself in dream carrying bread on my head and bird are eating thereof tell u they said the truth and meaning thereof for we see thou art one that doth good to all
Yusuf,60,0.296,0.079,0.809,0.112,he said before any food come in due course to feed either of you will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you that is part of the duty which my lord hath taught me have assure you abandoned the way of people that believe not in allah and that even deny the hereafter
Yusuf,39,0.0823,0.06,0.872,0.068,and follow the way of my father abraham isaac and jacob and never could we attribute any partner whatever to allah that come of the grace of allah to u and to mankind yet most men are not grateful
Yusuf,22,0.6808,0.109,0.596,0.295,my two companion of the prison ask you are many lord differing among themselves better or the one allah supreme and irresistible
Yusuf,50,-0.6281,0.122,0.851,0.027,if not him ye worship nothing but name which ye have named ye and your father for which allah hath sent down no authority the command is for none but allah he hath commanded that ye worship none but him that is the right religion but most men understand not
Yusuf,52,-0.4939,0.063,0.916,0.021,my two companion of the prison a to one of you he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink a for the other he will hang from the cross and the bird will eat from off his head so hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire
Yusuf,40,-0.7096,0.149,0.81,0.042,and of the two to that one whom he consider about to be saved he said mention me to thy lord but satan made him forget to mention him to his lord and joseph lingered in prison few more year
Yusuf,42,0.6124,0.0,0.867,0.133,the king of egypt said do see in vision seven fat kine whom seven lean one devour and seven green ear of corn and seven others withered ye chief expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret vision
Yusuf,16,0.1779,0.119,0.674,0.207,they said confused medley of dream and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,40,-0.3612,0.098,0.837,0.065,but the man who had been released one of the two who had been in prison and who now bethought him after so long space of time said will tell you the truth of it interpretation send ye me therefore
Yusuf,42,0.5106,0.0,0.901,0.099,joseph he said man of truth expound to u the dream of seven fat kine whom seven lean one devour and of seven green ear of corn and seven others withered that may return to the people and that they may understand
Yusuf,33,-0.0516,0.037,0.963,0.0,joseph said for seven year shall ye diligently sow a is your wont and the harvest that ye reap ye shall leave them in the ear except little of which ye shall eat
Yusuf,31,-0.4404,0.088,0.912,0.0,then will come after that period seven dreadful year which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them all except little which ye shall have specially guarded
Yusuf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then will come after that period year in which the people will have abundant water and in which they will press wine and oil
Yusuf,50,0.8126,0.045,0.784,0.171,so the king said bring ye him unto me but when the messenger came to him joseph said go thou back to thy lord and ask him what is the state of mind of the lady who cut their hand for my lord is certainly well aware of their snare
Yusuf,66,0.7579,0.084,0.737,0.179,the king said to the lady what wa your affair when ye did seek to seduce joseph from his true self the lady said allah preserve u no evil know we against him said the aziz wife now is the truth manifest to all it wa who sought to seduce him from his true self he is indeed of those who are ever true and virtuous
Yusuf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this say in order that he may know that have never been false to him in his absence and that allah will never guide the snare of the false one
Yusuf,32,0.7435,0.139,0.595,0.266,nor do absolve my own self of blame the human soul is certainly prone to evil unless my lord do bestow his mercy but surely my lord is oft forgiving most merciful
Yusuf,45,0.3612,0.0,0.946,0.054,so the king said bring him unto me will take him specially to serve about my own person therefore when he had spoken to him he said be assured this day thou art before our own presence with rank firmly established and fidelity fully proved
Yusuf,21,0.3612,0.0,0.884,0.116,joseph said set me over the store house of the land will indeed guard them a one that know their importance
Yusuf,44,0.8948,0.063,0.646,0.292,thus did we give established power to joseph in the land to take possession therein a when or where he pleased we bestow of our mercy on whom we please and we suffer not to be lost the reward of those who do good
Yusuf,19,0.9161,0.0,0.61,0.39,but verily the reward of the hereafter is the best for those who believe and are constant in righteousness
Yusuf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then came joseph brother they entered his presence and he knew them but they knew him not
Yusuf,44,0.8044,0.0,0.85,0.15,and when he had furnished them forth with provision suitable for them he said bring unto me brother ye have of the same father a yourselves but different mother see ye not that pay out full measure and that do provide the best hospitality
Yusuf,24,-0.296,0.087,0.913,0.0,now if ye bring him not to me ye shall have no measure of corn from me nor shall ye even come near me
Yusuf,20,0.6249,0.0,0.779,0.221,they said we shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father indeed we shall do it
Yusuf,39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and joseph told his servant to put their stock in trade with which they had bartered into their saddle bag so they should know it only when they returned to their people in order that they might come back
Yusuf,45,0.25,0.046,0.886,0.068,now when they returned to their father they said our father no more measure of grain shall we get unless we take our brother so send our brother with u that we may get our measure and we will indeed take every care of him
Yusuf,40,0.9555,0.0,0.666,0.334,he said shall trust you with him with any result other than when trusted you with his brother aforetime but allah is the best to take care of him and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
Yusuf,71,0.5834,0.0,0.921,0.079,then when they opened their baggage they found their stock in trade had been returned to them they said our father what more can we desire this our stock in trade ha been returned to u so we shall get more food for our family we shall take care of our brother and add at the same time full camel load of grain to our provision this is but small quantity
Yusuf,59,-0.4019,0.111,0.853,0.036,jacob said never will send him with you until ye swear solemn oath to me in allah name that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in and made powerless and when they had sworn their solemn oath he said over all that we say be allah the witness and guardian
Yusuf,48,0.8173,0.043,0.781,0.176,further he said my son enter not all by one gate enter ye by different gate not that can profit you aught against allah with my advice none can command except allah on him do put my trust and let all that trust put their trust on him
Yusuf,50,-0.1786,0.034,0.966,0.0,and when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined it did not profit them in the least against the plan of allah it wa but necessity of jacob soul which he discharged for he wa by our instruction full of knowledge and experience but most men know not
Yusuf,33,-0.5214,0.095,0.905,0.0,now when they came into joseph presence he received his full brother to stay with him he said to him behold am thy own brother so grieve not at aught of their doings
Yusuf,37,-0.316,0.084,0.864,0.052,at length when he had furnished them forth with provision suitable for them he put the drinking cup into his brother saddle bag then shouted out crier ye in the caravan behold ye are thief without doubt

Al-Kahf,34,0.4767,0.0,0.886,0.114,it may be that my lord will give me something better than thy garden and that he will send on thy garden thunderbolt by way of reckoning from heaven making it but slippery sand
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never be able to find it
Al-Kahf,53,0.5267,0.102,0.743,0.155,so his fruit and enjoyment were encompassed with ruin and he remained twisting and turning his hand over what he had spent on his property which had now tumbled to piece to it very foundation and he could only say woe is me would had never ascribed partner to my lord and cherisher
Al-Kahf,16,0.3565,0.068,0.781,0.151,nor had he number to help him against allah nor wa he able to deliver himself
Al-Kahf,22,0.9618,0.0,0.478,0.522,there the only protection come from allah the true one he is the best to reward and the best to give success
Al-Kahf,49,0.1901,0.0,0.965,0.035,set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world it is like the rain which we send down from the sky the earth vegetation absorbs it but soon it becomes dry stubble which the wind do scatter it is only allah who prevails over all thing
Al-Kahf,35,0.9825,0.0,0.505,0.495,wealth and son are allurement of the life of this world but the thing that endure good deed are best in the sight of thy lord a reward and best a the foundation for hope
Al-Kahf,32,0.0382,0.0,0.963,0.037,one day we shall remove the mountain and thou wilt see the earth a level stretch and we shall gather them all together nor shall we leave out any one of them
Al-Kahf,40,0.25,0.0,0.947,0.053,and they will be marshalled before thy lord in rank with the announcement now have ye come to u bare a we created you first aye ye thought we shall not fulfil the appointment made to you to meet u
Al-Kahf,66,-0.4215,0.147,0.743,0.111,and the book of deed will be placed before you and thou wilt see the sinful in great terror because of what is recorded therein they will say ah woe to u what book is this it leaf out nothing small or great but take account thereof they will find all that they did placed before them and not one will thy lord treat with injustice
Al-Kahf,57,-0.93,0.21,0.79,0.0,behold we said to the angel bow down to adam they bowed down except iblis he wa one of the jinns and he broke the command of his lord will ye then take him and his progeny a protector rather than me and they are enemy to you evil would be the exchange for the wrong doer
Al-Kahf,32,0.836,0.0,0.724,0.276,called them not to witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor even their own creation nor is it for helper such a me to take a lead men astray
Al-Kahf,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,one day he will say call on those whom ye thought to be my partner and they will call on them but they will not listen to them and we shall make for them place of common perdition
Al-Kahf,24,-0.802,0.281,0.719,0.0,and the sinful shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein no mean will they find to turn away therefrom
Al-Kahf,25,-0.2999,0.114,0.815,0.071,we have explained in detail in this qur an for the benefit of mankind every kind of similitude but man is in most thing contentious
Al-Kahf,49,0.1766,0.031,0.905,0.064,and what is there to keep back men from believing now that guidance ha come to them nor from praying for forgiveness from their lord but that they ask that the way of the ancient be repeated with them or the wrath be brought to them face to face
Al-Kahf,42,-0.8765,0.32,0.534,0.146,we only send the messenger to give glad tidings and to give warning but the unbeliever dispute with vain argument in order therewith to weaken the truth and they treat my sign a jest a also the fact that they are warned
Al-Kahf,61,0.0843,0.074,0.862,0.064,and who doth more wrong than one who is reminded of the sign of his lord but turn away from them forgetting the deed which his hand have sent forth verily we have set veil over their heart lest they should understand this and over their ear deafness if thou callest them to guidance even then will they never accept guidance
Al-Kahf,45,0.6474,0.121,0.684,0.195,but your lord is most forgiving full of mercy if he were to call them at once to account for what they have earned then surely he would have hastened their punishment but they have their appointed time beyond which they will find no refuge
Al-Kahf,19,-0.765,0.289,0.648,0.063,such were the population we destroyed when they committed iniquity but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,26,0.0258,0.0,0.958,0.042,behold moses said to his attendant will not give up until reach the junction of the two sea or until spend year and year in travel
Al-Kahf,22,0.4497,0.0,0.828,0.172,but when they reached the junction they forgot about their fish which took it course through the sea straight a in tunnel
Al-Kahf,29,-0.3182,0.157,0.755,0.088,when they had passed on some distance moses said to his attendant bring u our early meal truly we have suffered much fatigue at this stage of our journey
Al-Kahf,40,-0.4215,0.091,0.909,0.0,he replied sawest thou what happened when we betook ourselves to the rock did indeed forget about the fish none but satan made me forget to tell you about it it took it course through the sea in marvellous way
Al-Kahf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said that wa what we were seeking after so they went back on their footstep following the path they had come
Al-Kahf,25,0.3612,0.0,0.906,0.094,so they found one of our servant on whom we had bestowed mercy from ourselves and whom we had taught knowledge from our own presence
Al-Kahf,24,0.3182,0.0,0.909,0.091,moses said to him may follow thee on the footing that thou teach me something of the higher truth which thou hast been taught
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the other said verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how canst thou have patience about thing about which thy understanding is not complete
Al-Kahf,18,0.4902,0.0,0.842,0.158,moses said thou wilt find me if allah so will truly patient nor shall disobey thee in aught
Al-Kahf,22,-0.296,0.095,0.905,0.0,the other said if then thou wouldst follow me ask me no question about anything until myself speak to thee concerning it
Al-Kahf,33,-0.3818,0.143,0.781,0.076,so they both proceeded until when they were in the boat he scuttled it said moses hast thou scuttled it in order to drown those in it truly strange thing hast thou done
Al-Kahf,14,-0.296,0.145,0.855,0.0,he answered did not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me
Al-Kahf,16,-0.0557,0.129,0.753,0.118,moses said rebuke me not for forgetting nor grieve me by raising difficulty in my case
Al-Kahf,32,-0.0015,0.069,0.862,0.069,then they proceeded until when they met young man he slew him moses said hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none truly foul unheard of thing hast thou done
Al-Kahf,14,-0.296,0.145,0.855,0.0,he answered did not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with me
Al-Kahf,26,0.0772,0.0,0.951,0.049,moses said if ever ask thee about anything after this keep me not in thy company then wouldst thou have received full excuse from my side
Al-Kahf,53,0.3612,0.078,0.818,0.104,then they proceeded until when they came to the inhabitant of town they asked them for food but they refused them hospitality they found there wall on the point of falling down but he set it up straight moses said if thou hadst wished surely thou couldst have exacted some recompense for it
Al-Kahf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he answered this is the parting between me and thee now will tell thee the interpretation of those thing over which thou wast unable to hold patience
Al-Kahf,37,0.3291,0.051,0.813,0.136,a for the boat it belonged to certain men in dire want they plied on the water but wished to render it unserviceable for there wa after them certain king who seized on every boat by force
Al-Kahf,27,-0.6908,0.285,0.631,0.084,a for the youth his parent were people of faith and we feared that he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude to allah and man
Al-Kahf,21,0.8261,0.0,0.675,0.325,so we desired that their lord would give them in exchange son better in purity of conduct and closer in affection
Al-Kahf,76,0.9378,0.0,0.796,0.204,a for the wall it belonged to two youth orphan in the town there wa beneath it buried treasure to which they were entitled their father had been righteous man so thy lord desired that they should attain their age of full strength and get out their treasure mercy and favour from thy lord did it not of my own accord such is the interpretation of those thing over which thou wast unable to hold patience
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they ask thee concerning zul qarnain say will rehearse to you something of his story
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily we established his power on earth and we gave him the way and the mean to all end
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,one such way he followed
Al-Kahf,40,0.4588,0.073,0.748,0.179,until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it set in spring of murky water near it he found people we said zul qarnain thou hast authority either to punish them or to treat them with kindness
Al-Kahf,28,-0.9201,0.353,0.647,0.0,he said whoever doth wrong him shall we punish then shall he be sent back to his lord and he will punish him with punishment unheard of before
Al-Kahf,24,0.872,0.0,0.702,0.298,but whoever belief and work righteousness he shall have goodly reward and easy will be his task a we order it by our command
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then followed he another way
Al-Kahf,27,-0.296,0.078,0.922,0.0,until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on people for whom we had provided no covering protection against the sun
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he left them a they were we completely understood what wa before him
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then followed he another way
Al-Kahf,17,0.1027,0.0,0.92,0.08,until when he reached tract between two mountain he found beneath them people who scarcely understood word
Al-Kahf,31,0.2732,0.114,0.769,0.117,they said zul qarnain the gog and magog people do great mischief on earth shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest erect barrier between u and them
Al-Kahf,30,0.9186,0.037,0.6,0.362,he said the power in which my lord ha established me is better than tribute help me therefore with strength and labour will erect strong barrier between you and them
Al-Kahf,46,-0.6486,0.11,0.89,0.0,bring me block of iron at length when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountain side he said blow with your bellow then when he had made it red a fire he said bring me that may pour over it molten lead
Al-Kahf,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it
Al-Kahf,32,0.8847,0.0,0.712,0.288,he said this is mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord come to pas he will make it into dust and the promise of my lord is true
Al-Kahf,26,0.3182,0.043,0.866,0.09,on that day we shall leave them to surge like wave on one another the trumpet will be blown and we shall collect them all together
Al-Kahf,14,-0.6808,0.261,0.739,0.0,and we shall present hell that day for unbeliever to see all spread out
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,unbeliever whose eye had been under veil from remembrance of me and who had been unable even to hear
Al-Kahf,25,-0.2263,0.152,0.693,0.155,do the unbeliever think that they can take my servant a protector besides me verily we have prepared hell for the unbeliever for their entertainment
Al-Kahf,15,0.1725,0.142,0.681,0.177,say shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deed
Al-Kahf,20,-0.0772,0.133,0.747,0.12,those whose effort have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their work
Al-Kahf,39,-0.6369,0.123,0.877,0.0,they are those who deny the sign of their lord and the fact of their having to meet him in the hereafter vain will be their work nor shall we on the day of judgment give them any weight
Al-Kahf,20,-0.34,0.26,0.526,0.214,that is their reward hell because they rejected faith and took my sign and my messenger by way of jest
Al-Kahf,18,0.7906,0.0,0.682,0.318,a to those who believe and work righteous deed they have for their entertainment the garden of paradise
Al-Kahf,14,0.25,0.126,0.632,0.241,wherein they shall dwell for aye no change will they wish for from them
Al-Kahf,39,0.0,0.06,0.881,0.06,say if the ocean were ink wherewith to write out the word of my lord sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the word of my lord even if we added another ocean like it for it aid
Al-Kahf,41,0.9209,0.053,0.645,0.302,say am but man like yourselves but the inspiration ha come to me that your allah is one allah whoever expects to meet his lord let him work righteousness and in the worship of his lord admit no one a partner
Maryam,5,-0.1779,0.365,0.353,0.282,kaf ha ya ain sad
Maryam,13,0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,this is recital of the mercy of thy lord to his servant zakariya
Maryam,8,-0.3818,0.271,0.729,0.0,behold he cried to his lord in secret
Maryam,29,0.2144,0.0,0.905,0.095,praying my lord infirm indeed are my bone and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey but never am unblest my lord in my prayer to thee

Maryam,24,0.6124,0.0,0.815,0.185,he said so it will be thy lord saith that is easy for me did indeed create thee before when thou hadst been nothing
Maryam,29,0.1285,0.069,0.846,0.085,zakariya said my lord give me sign thy sign wa the answer shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three night although thou art not dumb
Maryam,26,0.8074,0.0,0.767,0.233,so zakariya came out to his people from him chamber he told them by sign to celebrate allah praise in the morning and in the evening
Maryam,22,0.5267,0.0,0.855,0.145,to his son came the command yahya take hold of the book with might and we gave him wisdom even a youth

Maryam,18,0.1761,0.139,0.693,0.169,she said seek refuge from thee to allah most gracious come not near if thou dost fear allah
Maryam,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,he said nay am only messenger from thy lord to announce to thee the gift of holy son
Maryam,17,0.0516,0.112,0.765,0.122,she said how shall have son seeing that no man ha touched me and am not unchaste

Maryam,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so she conceived him and she retired with him to remote place
Maryam,35,-0.936,0.338,0.662,0.0,and the pain of childbirth drove her to the trunk of palm tree she cried in her anguish ah would that had died before this would that had been thing forgotten and out of sight

Maryam,19,0.1531,0.081,0.81,0.11,and shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm tree it will let fall fresh ripe date upon thee
Maryam,35,0.7346,0.0,0.842,0.158,so eat and drink and cool thine eye and if thou dost see any man say have vowed fast to allah most gracious and this day will enter into not talk with any human being

Ta-Ha,13,-0.8126,0.402,0.598,0.0,but speak to him mildly perchance he may take warning or fear allah
Ta-Ha,22,-0.4939,0.138,0.862,0.0,they moses and aaron said our lord we fear lest he hasten with insolence against u or lest he transgress all bound

Ta-Ha,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when this message wa delivered pharaoh said who then moses is the lord of you two
Ta-Ha,21,0.25,0.0,0.909,0.091,he said our lord is he who gave to each created thing it form and nature and further gave it guidance
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pharaoh said what then is the condition of previous generation
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he replied the knowledge of that is with my lord duly recorded my lord never errs nor forgets
Ta-Ha,45,0.8271,0.0,0.809,0.191,he who ha made for you the earth like carpet spread out ha enabled you to go about therein by road and channel and ha sent down water from the sky with it have we produced diverse pair of plant each separate from the others
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,eat for yourselves and pasture your cattle verily in this are sign for men endued with understanding
Ta-Ha,24,0.2732,0.0,0.916,0.084,from the earth did we create you and into it shall we return you and from it shall we bring you out once again
Ta-Ha,13,-0.7469,0.366,0.634,0.0,and we showed pharaoh all our sign but he did reject and refuse
Ta-Ha,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said hast thou come to drive u out of our land with thy magic moses
Ta-Ha,35,0.8786,0.0,0.754,0.246,but we can surely produce magic to match thine so make tryst between u and thee which we shall not fail to keep neither we nor thou in place where both shall have even chance
Ta-Ha,22,0.6486,0.0,0.791,0.209,moses said your tryst is the day of the festival and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so pharaoh withdrew he concerted his plan and then came back
Ta-Ha,27,-0.9169,0.359,0.641,0.0,moses said to him woe to you forge not ye lie against allah lest he destroy you at once utterly by chastisement the forger must suffer frustration
Ta-Ha,15,-0.2118,0.116,0.884,0.0,so they disputed one with another over their affair but they kept their talk secret
Ta-Ha,30,0.7178,0.0,0.824,0.176,they said these two are certainly expert magician their object is to drive you out from your land with their magic and to do away with your most cherished institution
Ta-Ha,20,0.886,0.0,0.62,0.38,therefore concert your plan and then assemble in serried rank he win all along today who gain the upper hand
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moses whether wilt thou that thou throw first or that we be the first to throw
Ta-Ha,29,0.4404,0.0,0.906,0.094,he said nay throw ye first then behold their rope and their rod so it seemed to him on account of their magic began to be in lively motion
Ta-Ha,9,-0.5413,0.304,0.696,0.0,so moses conceived in his mind sort of fear
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.208,0.584,0.208,we said fear not for thou hast indeed the upper hand
Ta-Ha,36,0.4626,0.062,0.824,0.114,throw that which is in thy right hand quickly will it swallow up that which they have faked what they have faked is but magician trick and the magician thrives not no matter where he go
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the magician were thrown down to prostration they said we believe in the lord of aaron and moses
Ta-Ha,62,0.5313,0.114,0.713,0.173,pharaoh said believe ye in him before give you permission surely this must be your leader who ha taught you magic be sure will cut off your hand and foot on opposite side and will have you crucified on trunk of palm tree so shall ye know for certain which of u can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment
Ta-Ha,42,0.5945,0.0,0.884,0.116,they said never shall we regard thee a more than the clear sign that have come to u or than him who created u so decree whatever thou desirest to decree for thou canst only decree touching the life of this world
Ta-Ha,30,0.5574,0.082,0.727,0.191,for u we have believed in our lord may he forgive u our fault and the magic to which thou didst compel u for allah is best and most abiding
Ta-Ha,22,-0.3515,0.172,0.71,0.118,verily he who come to his lord a sinner at judgment for him is hell therein shall he neither die nor live
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but such a come to him a believer who have worked righteous deed for them are rank exalted
Ta-Ha,24,-0.0516,0.144,0.686,0.17,garden of eternity beneath which flow river they will dwell therein for aye such is the reward of those who purify themselves from evil
Ta-Ha,33,0.7996,0.038,0.741,0.221,we sent an inspiration to moses travel by night with my servant and strike dry path for them through the sea without fear of being overtaken by pharaoh and without any other fear
Ta-Ha,17,0.1875,0.0,0.902,0.098,then pharaoh pursued them with his force but the water completely overwhelmed them and covered them up
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright
Ta-Ha,32,-0.5423,0.101,0.899,0.0,ye child of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made covenant with you on the right side of mount sinai and we sent down to you manna and quail
Ta-Ha,35,0.2382,0.071,0.809,0.12,saying eat of the good thing we have provided for your sustenance but commit no excess therein lest my wrath should justly descend on you and those on whom descends my wrath do perish indeed
Ta-Ha,28,0.9367,0.0,0.6,0.4,but without doubt am also he that forgives again and again to those who repent believe and do right who in fine are ready to receive true guidance
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when moses wa up on the mount allah said what made thee hasten in advance of thy people moses
Ta-Ha,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,he replied behold they are close on my footstep hastened to thee my lord to please thee
Ta-Ha,16,0.34,0.0,0.862,0.138,allah said we have tested thy people in thy absence the samiri ha led them astray
Ta-Ha,56,0.2315,0.14,0.679,0.181,so moses returned to his people in state of indignation and sorrow he said my people did not your lord make handsome promise to you did then the promise seem to you long in coming or did ye desire that wrath should descend from your lord on you and so ye broke your promise to me
Ta-Ha,45,-0.6685,0.139,0.861,0.0,they said we broke not the promise to thee a far a lay in our power but we were made to carry the weight of the ornament of the whole people and we threw them into the fire and that wa what the samiri suggested
Ta-Ha,34,0.1531,0.141,0.704,0.156,then he brought out of the fire before the people the image of calf it seemed to low so they said this is your god and the god of moses but moses ha forgotten
Ta-Ha,28,-0.4215,0.17,0.744,0.086,could they not see that it could not return them word for answer and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good
Ta-Ha,31,0.5984,0.0,0.885,0.115,aaron had already before this said to them my people ye are being tested in this for verily your lord is allah most gracious so follow me and obey my command
Ta-Ha,21,0.5863,0.0,0.789,0.211,they had said we will not abandon this cult but we will devote ourselves to it until moses return to u
Ta-Ha,13,-0.4767,0.205,0.795,0.0,moses said aaron what kept thee back when thou sawest them going wrong
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,from following me didst thou then disobey my order
Ta-Ha,41,-0.1164,0.12,0.77,0.11,aaron replied son of my mother seize me not by my beard nor by the hair of my head truly feared lest thou shouldst say thou ha caused division among the child of israel and thou didst not respect my word
Ta-Ha,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said what then is thy case samiri
Ta-Ha,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he replied saw what they saw not so took handful of dust from the footprint of the messenger and threw it into the calf thus did my soul suggest to me
Ta-Ha,59,0.6731,0.144,0.63,0.226,moses said get thee gone but thy punishment in this life will be that thou wilt say touch me not and moreover for future penalty thou hast promise that will not fail now look at thy god of whom thou hast become devoted worshipper we will certainly melt it in blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea
Ta-Ha,23,0.3612,0.1,0.712,0.189,but the god of you all is the one allah there is no god but he all thing he comprehends in his knowledge
Ta-Ha,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus do we relate to thee some story of what happened before for we have sent thee message from our own presence
Ta-Ha,16,-0.4404,0.162,0.838,0.0,if any do turn away therefrom verily they will bear burden on the day of judgment
Ta-Ha,17,-0.7096,0.282,0.718,0.0,they will abide in this state and grievous will the burden be to them on that day
Ta-Ha,19,-0.7906,0.292,0.708,0.0,the day when the trumpet will be sounded that day we shall gather the sinful blear eyed with terror
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in whisper will they consult each other yet tarried not longer than ten day
Ta-Ha,22,0.6369,0.0,0.833,0.167,we know best what they will say when their leader most eminent in conduct will say ye tarried not longer than day
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they ask thee concerning the mountain say my lord will uproot them and scatter them a dust
Ta-Ha,9,-0.0516,0.146,0.854,0.0,he will leave them a plain smooth and level
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place
Ta-Ha,40,0.3174,0.039,0.868,0.094,on that day will they follow the caller straight no crookedness can they show him all sound shall humble themselves in the presence of allah most gracious nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their foot a they march
Ta-Ha,27,0.8122,0.063,0.632,0.304,on that day shall no intercession avail except for those for whom permission ha been granted by allah most gracious and whose word is acceptable to him
Ta-Ha,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he know what appears to his creature a before or after or behind them but they shall not compass it with their knowledge
Ta-Ha,25,-0.4588,0.111,0.889,0.0,all face shall be humbled before him the living the self subsisting eternal hopeless indeed will be the man that carry iniquity on his back
Ta-Ha,25,-0.7227,0.307,0.517,0.176,but he who work deed of righteousness and ha faith will have no fear of harm nor of any curtailment of what is his due
Ta-Ha,35,-0.6808,0.145,0.855,0.0,thus have we sent this down an arabic qur an and explained therein in detail some of the warning in order that they may fear allah or that it may cause their remembrance of him
Ta-Ha,32,0.1655,0.0,0.949,0.051,high above all is allah the king the truth be not in haste with the qur an before it revelation to thee is completed but say my lord advance me in knowledge
Ta-Ha,21,0.1531,0.111,0.754,0.135,we had already beforehand taken the covenant of adam but he forgot and we found on his part no firm resolve
Ta-Ha,18,0.3252,0.0,0.879,0.121,when we said to the angel prostrate yourselves to adam they prostrated themselves but not iblis he refused
Ta-Ha,32,-0.802,0.194,0.806,0.0,then we said adam verily this is an enemy to thee and thy wife so let him not get you both out of the garden so that thou art landed in misery
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,there is therein enough provision for thee not to go hungry nor to go naked
Ta-Ha,10,0.431,0.0,0.759,0.241,nor to suffer from thirst nor from the sun heat
Ta-Ha,23,-0.6385,0.203,0.7,0.096,but satan whispered evil to him he said adam shall lead thee to the tree of eternity and to kingdom that never decay
Ta-Ha,40,-0.1531,0.059,0.896,0.045,in the result they both ate of the tree and so their nakedness appeared to them they began to sew together for their covering leaf from the garden thus did adam disobey his lord and allow himself to be seduced
Ta-Ha,16,0.5719,0.0,0.802,0.198,but his lord chose him for his grace he turned to him and gave him guidance
Ta-Ha,43,0.87,0.0,0.799,0.201,he said get ye down both of you all together from the garden with enmity one to another but if a is sure there come to you guidance from me whosoever follows my guidance will not lose his way nor fall into misery

Al-Qasas,3,-0.5574,0.643,0.357,0.0,ta sin mim
Al-Qasas,10,0.3818,0.0,0.776,0.224,these are verse of the book that make thing clear
Al-Qasas,18,0.3182,0.0,0.881,0.119,we rehearse to thee some of the story of moses and pharaoh in truth for people who believe
Al-Qasas,36,0.25,0.155,0.668,0.177,truly pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up it people into section depressing small group among them their son he slew but he kept alive their female for he wa indeed maker of mischief
Al-Qasas,25,0.4767,0.104,0.694,0.202,and we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land to make them leader in faith and make them heir
Al-Qasas,29,0.4939,0.0,0.897,0.103,to establish firm place for them in the land and to show pharaoh haman and their host at their hand the very thing against which they were taking precaution
Al-Qasas,46,-0.7659,0.191,0.717,0.093,so we sent this inspiration to the mother of moses suckle thy child but when thou hast fear about him cast him into the river but fear not nor grieve for we shall restore him to thee and we shall make him one of our messenger
Al-Qasas,38,-0.8316,0.201,0.799,0.0,then the people of pharaoh picked him up from the river it wa intended that moses should be to them an adversary and cause of sorrow for pharaoh and haman and all their host were men of sin
Al-Qasas,44,0.6705,0.0,0.879,0.121,the wife of pharaoh said here is joy of the eye for me and for thee slay him not it may be that he will be use to u or we may adopt him a son and they perceived not what they were doing
Al-Qasas,37,0.1783,0.072,0.839,0.089,but there came to be void in the heart of the mother of moses she wa going almost to disclose his case had we not strengthened her heart with faith so that she might remain firm believer
Al-Qasas,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to the sister of moses follow him so she the sister watched him in the character of stranger and they knew not
Al-Qasas,40,-0.25,0.113,0.819,0.069,and we ordained that he refused suck at first until his sister came up and said shall point out to you the people of house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him
Al-Qasas,38,0.685,0.0,0.792,0.208,thus did we restore him to his mother that her eye might be comforted that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of allah is true but most of them do not understand
Al-Qasas,27,0.886,0.0,0.669,0.331,when he reached full age and wa firmly established in life we bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge for thus do we reward those who do good
Al-Qasas,73,-0.9531,0.214,0.786,0.0,and he entered the city at time when it people were not watching and he found there two men fighting one of his own religion and the other of his foe now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe and moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him he said this is work of evil satan for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads
Al-Qasas,26,0.5829,0.089,0.675,0.236,he prayed my lord have indeed wronged my soul do thou then forgive me so allah forgave him for he is the oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Qasas,21,-0.4692,0.22,0.675,0.105,he said my lord for that thou hast bestowed thy grace on me never shall be help to those who sin
Al-Qasas,44,0.7717,0.06,0.734,0.205,so he saw the morning in the city looking about in state of fear when behold the man who had the day before sought his help called aloud for his help again moses said to him thou art truly it is clear quarrelsome fellow
Al-Qasas,57,-0.6808,0.117,0.839,0.044,then when he decided to lay hold of the man who wa an enemy to both of them that man said moses is it thy intention to slay me a thou slewest man yesterday thy intention is none other than to become powerful violent man in the land and not to be one who set thing right
Al-Qasas,36,0.4019,0.0,0.928,0.072,and there came man running from the furthest end of the city he said moses the chief are taking counsel together about thee to slay thee so get thee away for do give thee sincere advice
Al-Qasas,23,-0.4767,0.214,0.678,0.108,he therefore got away therefrom looking about in state of fear he prayed my lord save me from people given to wrong doing
Al-Qasas,26,0.5859,0.0,0.833,0.167,then when he turned his face towards the land of madyan he said do hope that my lord will show me the smooth and straight path
Al-Qasas,61,0.0258,0.0,0.982,0.018,and when he arrived at the watering place in madyan he found there group of men watering their flock and besides them he found two woman who were keeping back their flock he said what is the matter with you they said we cannot water our flock until the shepherd take back their flock and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,31,0.5423,0.064,0.776,0.161,so he watered their flock for them then he turned back to the shade and said my lord truly am in desperate need of any good that thou dost send me
Al-Qasas,51,-0.4242,0.141,0.748,0.111,afterwards one of the damsel came back to him walking bashfully she said my father invite thee that he may reward thee for having watered our flock for u so when he came to him and narrated the story he said fear thou not well hast thou escaped from unjust people
Al-Qasas,29,0.9559,0.0,0.553,0.447,said one of the damsel my dear father engage him on wage truly the best of men for thee to employ is the man who is strong and trusty
Al-Qasas,53,0.1531,0.054,0.882,0.064,he said intend to wed one of these my daughter to thee on condition that thou serve me for eight year but if thou complete ten year it will be grace from thee but intend not to place thee under difficulty thou wilt find me indeed if allah will one of the righteous
Al-Qasas,31,-0.2023,0.138,0.773,0.088,he said be that the agreement between me and thee whichever of the two term fulfil let there be no ill will to me be allah witness to what we say
Al-Qasas,47,0.4215,0.088,0.772,0.14,now when moses had fulfilled the term and wa travelling with his family he perceived fire in the direction of mount tur he said to his family tarry ye perceive fire hope to bring you from there some information or burning firebrand that ye may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,31,-0.4767,0.094,0.906,0.0,but when he came to the fire voice wa heard from the right bank of the valley from tree in hallowed ground moses verily am allah the lord of the world
Al-Qasas,49,-0.0,0.079,0.824,0.097,now do thou throw thy rod but when he saw it moving of it own accord a if it had been snake he turned back in retreat and retraced not his step moses it wa said draw near and fear not for thou art of those who are secure
Al-Qasas,49,0.5187,0.14,0.667,0.193,move thy hand into thy bosom and it will come forth white without stain or harm and draw thy hand close to thy side to guard against fear those are the two credential from thy lord to pharaoh and his chief for truly they are people rebellious and wicked
Al-Qasas,15,-0.4939,0.186,0.814,0.0,he said my lord have slain man among them and fear lest they slay me
Al-Qasas,32,-0.0772,0.136,0.736,0.128,and my brother aaron he is more eloquent in speech than so send him with me a helper to confirm and strengthen me for fear that they may accuse me of falsehood
Al-Qasas,41,0.8481,0.0,0.752,0.248,he said we will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother and invest you both with authority so they shall not be able to touch you with our sign shall ye triumph you two a well a those who follow you
Al-Qasas,29,0.6187,0.0,0.842,0.158,when moses came to them with our clear sign they said this is nothing but sorcery faked up never did we head the like among our father of old
Al-Qasas,34,0.8126,0.071,0.688,0.241,moses said my lord know best who it is that come with guidance from him and whose end will be best in the hereafter certain it is that the wrong doer will not prosper
Al-Qasas,46,-0.431,0.12,0.796,0.084,pharaoh said chief no god do know for you but myself therefore haman light me kiln to bake brick out of clay and build me lofty palace that may mount up to the god of moses but a far a am concerned think moses is liar
Al-Qasas,26,-0.4939,0.118,0.882,0.0,and he wa arrogant and insolent in the land beyond reason he and his host they thought that they would not have to return to u
Al-Qasas,25,-0.4767,0.114,0.886,0.0,so we seized him and his host and we flung them into the sea now behold what wa the end of those who did wrong
Al-Qasas,21,0.1531,0.201,0.578,0.221,and we made them but leader inviting to the fire and on the day of judgment no help shall they find
Al-Qasas,23,-0.8519,0.317,0.683,0.0,in this world we made curse to follow them and on the day of judgment they will be among the loathed and despised
Al-Qasas,28,-0.1779,0.101,0.82,0.079,we did reveal to moses the book after we had destroyed the earlier generation to give insight to men and guidance and mercy that they might receive admonition
Al-Qasas,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thou wast not on the western side when we decreed the commission to moses nor wast thou witness of those event
Al-Qasas,39,0.6448,0.031,0.862,0.107,but we raised up new generation and long were the age that passed over them but thou wast not dweller among the people of madyan rehearsing our sign to them but it is we who send messenger with inspiration
Al-Qasas,45,-0.2732,0.096,0.852,0.052,nor wast thou at the side of the mountain of tur when we called to moses yet art thou sent a mercy from thy lord to give warning to people to whom no warner had come before thee in order that they may receive admonition
Al-Qasas,49,0.4939,0.0,0.936,0.064,if we had not sent thee to the quraish in case calamity should seize them for the deed that their hand have sent forth they might say our lord why didst thou not sent u messenger we should then have followed thy sign and been amongst those who believe
Al-Qasas,60,0.9334,0.0,0.782,0.218,but now when the truth ha come to them from ourselves they say why are not sign sent to him like those which were sent to moses do they not then reject the sign which were formerly sent to moses they say two kind of sorcery each assisting the other and they say for u we reject all such thing
Al-Qasas,24,0.7096,0.0,0.789,0.211,say then bring ye book from allah which is better guide than either of them that may follow it do if ye are truthful
Al-Qasas,41,-0.631,0.094,0.906,0.0,but if they hearken not to thee know that they only follow their own lust and who is more astray than one who follow his own lust devoid of guidance from allah for allah guide not people given to wrong doing
Al-Qasas,17,0.0258,0.0,0.936,0.064,now have we caused the word to reach them themselves in order that they may receive admonition
Al-Qasas,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we sent the book before this they do believe in this revelation
Al-Qasas,32,0.3182,0.0,0.931,0.069,and when it is recited to them they say we believe therein for it is the truth from our lord indeed we have been muslim bowing to allah will from before this
Al-Qasas,31,0.5106,0.147,0.627,0.227,twice will they be given their reward for that they have persevered that they avert evil with good and that they spend in charity out of what we have given them
Al-Qasas,29,0.3641,0.085,0.755,0.16,and when they hear vain talk they turn away therefrom and say to u our deed and to you yours peace be to you we seek not the ignorant
Al-Qasas,30,0.8271,0.0,0.784,0.216,it is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one whom thou lovest but allah guide those whom he will and he know best those who receive guidance
Al-Qasas,46,0.4404,0.0,0.917,0.083,they say if we were to follow the guidance with thee we should be snatched away from our land have we not established for them secure sanctuary to which are brought a tribute fruit of all kind provision from ourselves but most of them understand not
Al-Qasas,33,-0.6858,0.168,0.786,0.046,and how many population we destroyed which exulted in their life of ease and plenty now those habitation of theirs after them are deserted all but miserable few and we are their heir
Al-Qasas,35,-0.7906,0.175,0.825,0.0,nor wa thy lord the one to destroy population until he had sent to it centre messenger rehearsing to them our sign nor are we going to destroy population except when it member practise iniquity
Al-Qasas,35,0.1328,0.083,0.821,0.096,the material thing which ye are given are but the convenience of this life and the glitter thereof but that which is with allah is better and more enduring will ye not then be wise
Al-Qasas,49,-0.3919,0.08,0.834,0.086,are these two alike one to whom we have made goodly promise and who is going to reach it fulfilment and one to whom we have given the good thing of this life but who on the day of judgment is to be among those brought up for punishment
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that day allah will call to them and say where are my partner whom ye imagined to be such

Al-Qasas,27,-0.0516,0.089,0.828,0.083,then the whole story that day will seem obscure to them like light to the blind and they will not be able even to question each other
Al-Qasas,22,0.5927,0.0,0.845,0.155,but any that in this life had repented believed and worked righteousness will have hope to be among those who achieve salvation
Al-Qasas,30,0.5423,0.065,0.737,0.198,thy lord doe create and choose a he plea no choice have they in the matter glory to allah and far is he above the partner they ascribe to him

Al-Qasas,36,0.8658,0.0,0.749,0.251,it is out of his mercy that he ha made for you night and day that ye may rest therein and that ye may seek of his grace and in order that ye may be grateful
Al-Qasas,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day that he will call on them he will say where are my partner whom ye imagined to be such
Al-Qasas,37,0.0258,0.081,0.861,0.058,and from each people shall we draw witness and we shall say produce your proof then shall they know that the truth is in allah alone and the lie which they invented will leave them in lurch
Al-Qasas,53,0.8674,0.059,0.733,0.208,qarun wa doubtless of the people of moses but he acted insolently towards them such were the treasure we had bestowed on him that their very key would have been burden to body of strong men behold his people said to him exult not for allah loveth not those who exult in rich
Al-Qasas,51,0.9853,0.0,0.567,0.433,but seek with the wealth which allah ha bestowed on thee the home of the hereafter nor forget thy portion in this world but do thou good a allah ha been good to thee and seek not occasion for mischief in the land for allah love not those who do mischief
Al-Qasas,55,-0.5824,0.167,0.663,0.17,he said this ha been given to me because of certain knowledge which have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him whole generation which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount of rich they had collected but the wicked are not called immediately to account for their sin
Al-Qasas,44,0.9022,0.0,0.749,0.251,so he went forth among his people in the pride of his wordly glitter said those whose aim is the life of this world oh that we had the like of what qarun ha got for he is truly lord of mighty good fortune
Al-Qasas,40,0.961,0.059,0.583,0.358,but those who had been granted true knowledge said ala for you the reward of allah in the hereafter is best for those who believe and work righteousness but this none shall attain save those who steadfastly persevere in good
Al-Qasas,30,0.5918,0.0,0.853,0.147,then we caused the earth to swallow up him and his house and he had not the least little party to help him against allah nor could he defend himself
Al-Qasas,64,0.0258,0.101,0.811,0.088,and those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow ah it is indeed allah who enlarges the provision or restricts it to any of his servant he plea had it not been that allah wa gracious to u he could have caused the earth to swallow u up ah those who reject allah will assuredly never prosper

Al-Ankabut,20,-0.6652,0.19,0.81,0.0,but they rejected him then the mighty blast seized them and they lay prostrate in their home by the morning
Al-Ankabut,45,0.1027,0.084,0.805,0.111,remember also the ad and the thamud people clearly will appear to you from the trace of their building their fate the evil one made their deed alluring to them and kept them back from the path though they were gifted with intelligence and skill

Al-Ankabut,58,-0.9323,0.24,0.698,0.062,each one of them we seized for his crime of them against some we sent violent tornado with shower of stone some were caught by mighty blast some we caused the earth to swallow up and some we drowned in the water it wa not allah who injured or oppressed them they injured and oppressed their own soul
Al-Ankabut,34,0.5927,0.0,0.896,0.104,the parable of those who take protector other than allah is that of the spider who build to itself house but truly the flimsiest of house is the spider house if they but knew

As-Saaffaat,9,0.1531,0.183,0.583,0.233,they will reply nay ye yourselves had no faith
As-Saaffaat,17,-0.34,0.195,0.737,0.068,nor had we any authority over you nay it wa ye who were people in obstinate rebellion
As-Saaffaat,25,-0.323,0.211,0.62,0.17,so now ha been proved true against u the word of our lord that we shall indeed have to taste the punishment of our sin
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4404,0.0,0.756,0.244,we led you astray for truly we were ourselves astray
As-Saaffaat,10,0.2732,0.199,0.464,0.338,truly that day they will all share in the penalty
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily that is how we shall deal with sinner
As-Saaffaat,19,0.3182,0.097,0.705,0.198,for they when they were told that there is no god except allah would puff themselves up with pride
As-Saaffaat,15,0.2732,0.0,0.87,0.13,and say what shall we give up our god for the sake of poet possessed
As-Saaffaat,18,0.6115,0.0,0.762,0.238,nay he ha come with the very truth and he confirms the message of the messenger before him
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.7184,0.5,0.5,0.0,ye shall indeed taste of the grievous penalty
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.872,0.389,0.611,0.0,but it will be no more than the retribution of the evil that ye have wrought
As-Saaffaat,8,0.7964,0.0,0.458,0.542,but the sincere and devoted servant of allah
As-Saaffaat,5,0.34,0.0,0.625,0.375,for them is sustenance determined

As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they will turn to one another and question one another
As-Saaffaat,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,one of them will start the talk and say had an intimate companion on the earth
As-Saaffaat,18,0.3182,0.0,0.881,0.119,who used to say what art thou amongst those who bear witness to the truth of the message
As-Saaffaat,15,-0.5267,0.311,0.526,0.162,when we die and become dust and bone shall we indeed receive reward and punishment
As-Saaffaat,8,0.3612,0.0,0.737,0.263,voice said would ye like to look down
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.34,0.179,0.821,0.0,he looked down and saw him in the midst of the fire
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said by allah thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition
As-Saaffaat,18,0.6369,0.0,0.755,0.245,had it not been for the grace of my lord should certainly have been among those brought there
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4847,0.0,0.718,0.282,is it the case that we shall not die
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.3442,0.254,0.585,0.161,except our first death and that we shall not be punished
As-Saaffaat,6,0.5574,0.0,0.581,0.419,verily this is the supreme achievement
As-Saaffaat,12,0.6369,0.0,0.658,0.342,for the like of this let all strive who wish to strive
As-Saaffaat,10,0.6908,0.0,0.584,0.416,is that the better entertainment or the tree of zaqqum
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.0516,0.207,0.6,0.193,for we have truly made it a trial for the wrong doer
As-Saaffaat,13,-0.7906,0.389,0.611,0.0,for it is tree that spring out of the bottom of hell fire
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.6486,0.372,0.492,0.137,the shoot of it fruit stalk are like the head of devil
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4404,0.0,0.756,0.244,truly they will eat thereof and fill their belly therewith
As-Saaffaat,14,0.2023,0.0,0.878,0.122,then on top of that they will be given mixture made of boiling water
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.34,0.231,0.769,0.0,then shall their return be to the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.0516,0.238,0.538,0.223,truly they found their father on the wrong path
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they too were rushed down on their footstep
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4404,0.0,0.756,0.244,and truly before them many of the ancient went astray
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we sent aforetime among them messenger to admonish them
As-Saaffaat,14,-0.2382,0.13,0.87,0.0,then see what wa the end of those who were admonished but heeded not
As-Saaffaat,8,0.6597,0.0,0.526,0.474,except the sincere and devoted servant of allah
As-Saaffaat,17,0.3818,0.125,0.673,0.202,in the day of old noah cried to u and we are the best to hear prayer
As-Saaffaat,11,0.6249,0.0,0.709,0.291,and we delivered him and his people from the great calamity
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and made his progeny to endure on this earth
As-Saaffaat,14,0.5789,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we left this blessing for him among generation to come in later time
As-Saaffaat,8,0.5423,0.0,0.667,0.333,peace and salutation to noah among the nation
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5719,0.0,0.684,0.316,thus indeed do we reward those who do right
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for he wa one of our believing servant
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0516,0.0,0.854,0.146,then the rest we overwhelmed in the flood
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily among those who followed his way wa abraham
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,behold he approached his lord with sound heart
As-Saaffaat,16,0.296,0.0,0.872,0.128,behold he said to his father and to his people what is that which ye worship
As-Saaffaat,10,0.5859,0.0,0.625,0.375,is it falsehood god other than allah that ye desire
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then what is your idea about the lord of the world
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then did he cast glance at the star
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.5106,0.32,0.68,0.0,and he said am indeed sick at heart
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they turned away from him and departed
As-Saaffaat,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,then did he turn to their god and said will ye not eat of the offering before you
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.3356,0.197,0.715,0.087,what is the matter with you that ye speak not intelligently
As-Saaffaat,12,0.4939,0.0,0.775,0.225,then did he turn upon them striking them with the right hand
As-Saaffaat,10,0.1531,0.0,0.849,0.151,then came the worshipper with hurried step and faced him
As-Saaffaat,10,0.296,0.0,0.804,0.196,he said worship ye that which ye have yourselves carved
As-Saaffaat,8,0.6808,0.0,0.517,0.483,but allah ha created you and your handwork
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.34,0.179,0.821,0.0,they said build him furnace and throw him into the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.6897,0.289,0.711,0.0,this failing they then sought stratagem against him but we made them the one most humiliated
As-Saaffaat,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,he said will go to my lord he will surely guide me
As-Saaffaat,6,0.3612,0.0,0.667,0.333,my lord grant me righteous son
As-Saaffaat,14,0.2263,0.176,0.553,0.271,so we gave him the good news of boy ready to suffer and forbear
As-Saaffaat,53,0.2732,0.024,0.912,0.063,then when the son reached the age of serious work with him he said my son see in vision that offer thee in sacrifice now see what is thy view the son said my father do a thou art commanded thou will find me if allah so will one practising patience and constancy
As-Saaffaat,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so when they had both submitted their will to allah and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead for sacrifice
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we called out to him abraham
As-Saaffaat,15,0.8176,0.0,0.585,0.415,thou hast already fulfilled the vision thus indeed do we reward those who do right
As-Saaffaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for this wa obviously trial
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we ransomed him with momentous sacrifice
As-Saaffaat,14,0.5789,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we left this blessing for him among generation to come in later time
As-Saaffaat,5,0.5423,0.0,0.533,0.467,peace and salutation to abraham
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5719,0.0,0.684,0.316,thus indeed do we reward those who do right
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for he wa one of our believing servant
As-Saaffaat,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,and we gave him the good news of isaac prophet one of the righteous
As-Saaffaat,24,-0.4019,0.145,0.769,0.086,we blessed him and isaac but of their progeny are some that do right and some that obviously do wrong to their own soul
As-Saaffaat,11,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,again of old we bestowed our favour on moses and aaron
As-Saaffaat,11,0.6249,0.0,0.709,0.291,and we delivered them and their people from their great calamity
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.4019,0.252,0.748,0.0,and we helped them so they overcame their trouble
As-Saaffaat,12,0.6486,0.0,0.654,0.346,and we gave them the book which help to make thing clear
As-Saaffaat,8,0.2263,0.0,0.787,0.213,and we guided them to the straight way
As-Saaffaat,14,0.5789,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we left this blessing for them among generation to come in later time
As-Saaffaat,7,0.5423,0.0,0.632,0.368,peace and salutation to moses and aaron
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5719,0.0,0.684,0.316,thus indeed do we reward those who do right
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for they were two of our believing servant
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so also wa elia among those sent by u
As-Saaffaat,11,0.3875,0.0,0.792,0.208,behold he said to his people will ye not fear allah
As-Saaffaat,11,0.6369,0.0,0.704,0.296,will ye call upon baal and forsake the best of creator
As-Saaffaat,15,0.7506,0.0,0.67,0.33,allah your lord and cherisher and the lord and cherisher of your father of old
As-Saaffaat,13,-0.7684,0.4,0.458,0.142,but they rejected him and they will certainly be called up for punishment
As-Saaffaat,10,0.6597,0.0,0.597,0.403,except the sincere and devoted servant of allah among them
As-Saaffaat,14,0.5789,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we left this blessing for him among generation to come in later time
As-Saaffaat,7,0.5423,0.0,0.588,0.412,peace and salutation to such a elia
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5719,0.0,0.684,0.316,thus indeed do we reward those who do right
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for he wa one of our believing servant
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so also wa lut among those sent by u
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,behold we delivered him and his adherent all
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.296,0.18,0.82,0.0,except an old woman who wa among those who lagged behind
As-Saaffaat,5,-0.4939,0.444,0.556,0.0,then we destroyed the rest
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily ye pas by their site by day
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and by night will ye not understand
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so also wa jonah among those sent by u
As-Saaffaat,13,0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,when he ran away like slave from captivity to the ship fully laden
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.2023,0.242,0.583,0.175,he agreed to cast lot and he wa condemned
As-Saaffaat,15,0.128,0.131,0.71,0.158,then the big fish did swallow him and he had done act worthy of blame
As-Saaffaat,10,0.5106,0.0,0.732,0.268,had it not been that he repented and glorified allah
As-Saaffaat,13,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,he would certainly have remained inside the fish till the day of resurrection
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we cast him forth on the naked shore in state of sickness
As-Saaffaat,13,0.5267,0.0,0.779,0.221,and we caused to grow over him spreading plant of the gourd kind
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent him on mission to hundred thousand men or more
As-Saaffaat,13,0.4939,0.0,0.789,0.211,and they believed so we permitted them to enjoy their life for while
As-Saaffaat,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,now ask them their opinion is it that thy lord ha only daughter and they have son
As-Saaffaat,12,0.25,0.0,0.846,0.154,or that we created the angel female and they are witness thereto
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,is it not that they say from their own invention
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.5789,0.366,0.494,0.14,allah ha begotten child but they are liar
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,did he then choose daughter rather than son
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0258,0.0,0.879,0.121,what is the matter with you how judge ye
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,will ye not then receive admonition
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0772,0.0,0.794,0.206,or have ye an authority manifest
As-Saaffaat,11,0.5106,0.0,0.677,0.323,then bring ye your book of authority if ye be truthful
As-Saaffaat,27,0.4748,0.0,0.894,0.106,and they have invented blood relationship between him and the jinns but the jinns know quite well that they have indeed to appear before his judgment seat
As-Saaffaat,13,0.7783,0.0,0.618,0.382,glory to allah he is free from the thing they ascribe to him
As-Saaffaat,10,0.6597,0.0,0.597,0.403,not so do the servant of allah sincere and devoted
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.2235,0.212,0.788,0.0,for verily neither ye nor those ye worship
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,can lead any into temptation concerning allah
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.34,0.231,0.769,0.0,except such a are themselves going to the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,13,0.4767,0.0,0.78,0.22,those ranged in rank say not one of u but ha place appointed
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we are verily ranged in rank for service
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5423,0.0,0.696,0.304,and we are verily those who declare allah glory
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and there were those who said
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if only we had had before u message from those of old
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7783,0.0,0.506,0.494,we should certainly have been servant of allah sincere and devoted
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.1154,0.172,0.678,0.15,but now that the qur an ha come they reject it but soon will they know
As-Saaffaat,14,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,already ha our word been passed before this to our servant sent by u
As-Saaffaat,6,0.34,0.0,0.676,0.324,that they would certainly be assisted
As-Saaffaat,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,and that our force they surely must conquer
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so turn thou away from them for little while
As-Saaffaat,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and watch them how they fare and they soon shall see how thou farest
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.128,0.248,0.543,0.209,do they wish indeed to hurry on our punishment
As-Saaffaat,23,-0.8674,0.294,0.706,0.0,but when it descends into the open space before them evil will be the morning for those who were warned and heeded not
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so turn thou away from them for little while
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and watch how they fare and they soon shall see how thou farest
As-Saaffaat,19,0.8885,0.0,0.604,0.396,glory to thy lord the lord of honour and power he is free from what they ascribe to him
As-Saaffaat,5,0.5423,0.0,0.533,0.467,and peace on the messenger

Saad,24,-0.4588,0.255,0.583,0.163,how many generation before them did we destroy in the end they cried for mercy when there wa no longer time for being saved
Saad,21,0.34,0.0,0.893,0.107,so they wonder that warner ha come to them from among themselves and the unbeliever say this is sorcerer telling lie
Saad,14,0.8779,0.0,0.474,0.526,ha he made the god all into one allah truly this is wonderful thing
Saad,26,0.3182,0.088,0.749,0.163,and the leader among them go away impatiently saying walk ye away and remain constant to your god for this is truly thing designed against you
Saad,21,-0.1419,0.072,0.928,0.0,we never heard the like of this among the people of these latter day this is nothing but made up tale
Saad,30,-0.7814,0.214,0.738,0.048,what ha the message been sent to him of all person among u but they are in doubt concerning my own message nay they have not yet tasted my punishment
Saad,21,0.5719,0.0,0.802,0.198,or have they the treasure of the mercy of thy lord the exalted in power the grantor of bounty without measure
Saad,29,0.5267,0.0,0.86,0.14,or have they the dominion of the heaven and the earth and all between if so let them mount up with the rope and mean to reach that end
Saad,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but there will be put to flight even host of confederate
Saad,19,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,before them were many who rejected messenger the people of noah and ad and pharaoh the lord of stake
