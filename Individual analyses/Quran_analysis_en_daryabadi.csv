Al-Araf,35,0.5859,0.086,0.718,0.197,musa said unto his people seek help in allah and persevere verily the earth is allah he maketh whomsoever he willeth of his bondman inherit it and the happy end is of the god fearing
Al-Araf,43,-0.7906,0.201,0.737,0.062,they said oppressed we have been ere thou camest unto u and since thou hast come unto u he said belike your lord will destroy your enemy and establish yougs in their stead in the land thathe may see what wise ye act
Al-Araf,23,-0.4019,0.19,0.717,0.093,and assuredly we laid hold of the people of fir awn with lean year and lack of fruit that haply they might dread
Al-Araf,46,-0.62,0.14,0.82,0.041,so whenever good hap came unto them they would say ours is this and if mishap afflicted them they would lay it to the evil augury of musa and these with him behold their evil augury wa only with allah but most of them knew not
Al-Araf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they said whatsoever thou mayest bring unto u of the nature of sign wherewith to enchant u in thee we are not going to be believer
Al-Araf,31,-0.7351,0.176,0.824,0.0,thereafter we sent upon them the flood and the locust and the louse and the frog and the blood sign detailed yet they remained stiff necked and they were people sinful
Al-Araf,47,0.7003,0.0,0.881,0.119,and whensoever plague fell on them they said musa supplicate thy lord for u by that which he hath covenanted with thee surely if thou remove the plague from u we will surely believe in thee and we will send away with thee the child of israi
Al-Araf,20,0.4404,0.0,0.822,0.178,then whensoever we removed the plague from them till term which they were to reach lo they were breaking faith
Al-Araf,22,-0.7845,0.257,0.743,0.0,wherefore we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for they belied our sign and were neglectful of them
Al-Araf,64,-0.5719,0.127,0.796,0.077,and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern part of the land and the western part thereof which we had blest and fulfilled wa the good word of thy lord unto the child of isra il for they were long suffering and we destroyed that which fir awn and his people had builded and that which they had raised
Al-Araf,43,0.1779,0.056,0.85,0.094,and we led the child of isra il across the sea then they came upon people cleaving to the idol they had hev said musa make for u god even a they have god he said verily ye are people given to ignorance
Al-Araf,18,-0.5106,0.253,0.633,0.114,verily these destroyed is that wherein they are engaged and vain is that which they have been doing
Al-Araf,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,he said shall seek for you god other than allah whereas he hath preferred you above the world
Al-Araf,34,-0.4767,0.086,0.914,0.0,and recall what time we delivered you from the house of fir awn perpetrating on you terrible torment slaying your son and letting your woman live and therein wa trial from your lord tremendous
Al-Araf,49,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we treated with musa thirty night and we completed them with ten so the appointment of his lord wa completed by forty night and musa said unto his brother harun act thou in my place among my people and rectify and follow not the way of the corrupters
Al-Araf,90,0.6956,0.0,0.949,0.051,and when musa came at our appointment and his lord spake unto him he said my lord shew thyself unto me that may look at thee he said thou canst not see me but look at the yonder mount if it stand in it place then thou wilt see me then when his lord unveiled his glory unto the mount it turned it to dust and musa tell down thunderstruck then when he recovered he said hallowed be thou turn unto thee repentant and am the first of the believer
Al-Araf,30,0.5719,0.0,0.887,0.113,he said musa verily have chosen thee above mankind by my message and by my speaking so hold fast thou that which have given thee and be of the thankful
Al-Araf,41,0.6486,0.0,0.88,0.12,and we wrote for him in the tablet of everything an exhortation and and detail of everything so hold thou fast with firmness and bid thy people follow the best thereof anonl will shew you the dwelling of the ungodly people
Al-Araf,73,-0.4724,0.071,0.898,0.031,shall turn away from my sign those who are big with pride on the earth without justice and although they may see every sign they will not believe therein and if they see the path of rectitude they will not take it a their path and if they see the path of error they will take it for their path this is because they belied our sign and they were ever negligent thereof
Al-Araf,28,-0.6628,0.173,0.827,0.0,and those who belie our sign and the meeting of the hereafter vain shall be their work they shall be requited not save for that which they wrought
Al-Araf,37,-0.6369,0.129,0.871,0.0,and ehe people of musa after him took of their trinket calf body with low saw they not that it spake nor unto them nor could guide them to way they took it and became wrong doer
Al-Araf,31,-0.7018,0.226,0.714,0.06,and when they repented and saw that they had strayed they said if our lord have not mercy on u and forgive u not we shall surely be of the loser

Al-Kahf,30,0.3612,0.0,0.915,0.085,recall what time the youth betook themselves to the cave then said our lord vouchsafe unto u mercy from before thee and prepare for u in our affair right course
Al-Kahf,14,0.0772,0.0,0.909,0.091,wherefore we put covering over their ear in the cave for number of year
Al-Kahf,24,0.7845,0.0,0.761,0.239,thereafter we raised them up that we might know which of the two party wa best at reckoning the time that they had tarried
Al-Kahf,24,0.6705,0.0,0.764,0.236,we recount unto thee their tidings with truth verily they were certain youth who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,38,0.6597,0.0,0.87,0.13,and we braced their heart when they stood forth and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth never we shall call upon god beside him for then we shall be saying an abomination
Al-Kahf,31,0.4404,0.084,0.701,0.216,these our people have taken for themselves god beside him wherefore bring they not for them an authority manifest and who doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth against god lie

Al-Kahf,61,0.4939,0.039,0.873,0.087,and thou wouldst have deemed them awakes whereas they were asleep and we turned them over on the right side and on the left side while their dog stretched forth his two foreleg on the threshold if thou hadst observed them thou wouldst have surely turned away from them in fright and wouldst have surely been filled with awe of them
Al-Kahf,87,0.4588,0.024,0.93,0.046,and likewise we raised them up that they might question among themselves there spake speaker from amongst them how long have ye tarried they said we have tarried day or part of day they said your lord knoweth best how long ye have tarried now send one of you with this your money unto the city and let him see which food is purest there and let him bring you provision thereof and let him be circumspect and let him by no mean discover you to anycne
Al-Kahf,27,0.2467,0.061,0.844,0.095,verily they if they come to know of you would stone you or make you revert to their faith and lo then ye will never fare well
Al-Kahf,74,0.7906,0.084,0.752,0.164,and likewise we caused their affair to be lit upon that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that the hour there is no doubt thereof recall what time they were disputing among themselves regarding their affair and then they said build over them building their lord is the best knower about them then those who prevailed in their affair said surely we will raise over them place of worship
Al-Kahf,78,0.5267,0.025,0.908,0.067,anon they will say they were three the fourth of them their dog and they will say they were five the sixth of them their dog guessing at the unknown and they willl say they were seven the eighth of them their dog say thou my lord is the best knower of their number there knew them only few so debate thou not regarding them except an cut ward debating and ask not regarding them anyone of them

Al-Kahf,32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except with this reservation that allah so will and remember thy lord when thou forgettest and say thou belike my lord will guide me to something nearer than this to right direction
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they tarried in their cave three hundred year and added nine
Al-Kahf,40,0.7506,0.086,0.717,0.197,say thou allah knoweth best how long they tarried his alone is the hidden knowledge of the heaven and the earth how well he seeth and heareth they have no patron beside him nor in his rule he associateth anyone
Al-Kahf,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and rehearse thou that which hath been revealed unto thee of the book of thy lord and none may alter his word and never wilt thou find beside him covert
Al-Kahf,65,-0.1779,0.044,0.922,0.034,and endure thy self in the company of those who call upon their lord in the morning and evening seeking his and let not thine eye countenance rove from them seeking the adornment of the life of this world and obey thou not him whose heart we have made to neglect our remembrance and who followeth his lust and whose affair is exceeding the bound
Al-Kahf,64,-0.4404,0.182,0.659,0.159,and say thou the truth is from your lord let him therefore who will believe and let him who will disbelieve verily we have gotten ready for the wrong doer fire the awning whereof shall encompass them and if they cry for relief they shall be relieved with water like the dreg of oil scalding their face the drink and vile the resting place
Al-Kahf,25,-0.1779,0.1,0.824,0.075,verily those who believe and work the righteous work verily we waste not the hire of one who doth well in regard to his work
Al-Kahf,41,0.8126,0.0,0.841,0.159,these for them are garden everlasting whereunder river flow bedecked they shall be therein with bracelet of gold and wear they shall green robe of satin and brocade reclining therein on the couch excellent the reward and goodly the resting place
Al-Kahf,33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,propound thou unto them the similitude of two men we appointed to one of them two garden of vine and hedged both with date palm and we placed in between the twain tillage
Al-Kahf,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,each of the two garden brought forth it produce and stinted not aught thereof and we caused to gush forth in the midst of the twain river
Al-Kahf,28,0.4767,0.0,0.897,0.103,and he had property then he said unto his fellow while he spake with him am more than thou in substance and am mightier in respect of retinue
Al-Kahf,25,0.0,0.106,0.788,0.106,and he entered his garden while he wa wrong doer in respect of his own soul he said imagine not that this shall ever perish
Al-Kahf,26,0.765,0.0,0.743,0.257,nor imagine that the hour is going to happen and if am brought back to my lord surely will find something better than this a retreat
Al-Kahf,27,0.25,0.0,0.929,0.071,his fellow said unto him while he spake with him hast thou disbelieved in him who created thee of dust then of sperm and formed thee man
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but he is allah my lord and with my lord associate not anyone
Al-Kahf,31,-0.1779,0.136,0.776,0.089,wherefore saidst thou not when thou enteredest thy garden whatsoever allah may will there is no power save in allah if thou beholdest am inferior to thee in substance and offspring
Al-Kahf,25,0.7351,0.0,0.788,0.212,then belike my lord will vouchsafe unto me something better than thy garden and send thereon belt from the heaven that it become plane slippery
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or the water thereof become deep sunken so that therefor thou canst not make search
Al-Kahf,41,0.1779,0.056,0.872,0.072,and his property wa encompassed and lo he wa wringing the palm of his hand over that which he had expended thereon while itlay fallen down on it trellis and saying oh would that had not associated with my lord anyone
Al-Kahf,18,0.128,0.111,0.754,0.136,and there could be no party suceouring him a against allah nor could he himself be an avenger
Al-Kahf,23,0.9643,0.0,0.458,0.542,herein is all protection from allah the true he is excellent in respect of reward and excellent in respect of the final end
Al-Kahf,49,0.5106,0.0,0.934,0.066,and propound thou unto them the similitude of the life of the world it is a water which we send down from the heaven then there mingleth therewith the vegetation of the earth and lo it becometh dry stubble which the wind scatter and allah is over everything potent
Al-Kahf,33,0.9702,0.0,0.536,0.464,substance and son are the adornment of the life of the world and the righteous work that last are excellent with thy lord in respect of reward and excellent in respect of hope
Al-Kahf,32,-0.0516,0.037,0.963,0.0,and beware day whereon we will make the mountain to pas and thou wilt see the earth away plain and we shall gather them and we shall leave of them not one
Al-Kahf,36,-0.0516,0.061,0.884,0.055,and they shall be sent before thy lord in rank now are ye come to u even a we had created you the first time aye ye fancied that we had appointed for you no tryst
Al-Kahf,61,0.2292,0.056,0.873,0.07,and the book shall be placed and thou wilt see the culprit alarmed at that which is therein and they will say ah woe unto u what aileth this book that it leaveth not any sin small or great but it hath computed it and they shall find all that they had wrought present and thy lord wrongeth not any one
Al-Kahf,62,-0.872,0.131,0.869,0.0,and recall what time we said unto the angel prostrate yourselves before adam and they prostrated themselves but iblis did not he wa of the genius so he trespassed the commandment of his lord would ye then take him and his progeny a patron instead of me whereas they are unto you an enemy iii is for the wrong doer an exchange
Al-Kahf,28,0.8225,0.0,0.706,0.294,made them not present at the creation of the heaven and the earth nor at the creation of themselves nor wa one to take the seducer a supporter
Al-Kahf,36,-0.7351,0.154,0.846,0.0,and beware day whereon he will say cry unto my associate say cry unto whom ye fancied so they will call unto them and they will answer them not and we shall place between them partition
Al-Kahf,25,-0.1779,0.089,0.849,0.063,and the culprit will behold the fire and imagine that they are about to fall therein and they shall not find therefrom way of escape
Al-Kahf,25,-0.101,0.105,0.804,0.091,and assuredly we have variously propounded in this qur an for mankind every kind of similitude and man is of all thing the most disputing
Al-Kahf,43,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and naught preventeth mankind from believing when the guidance hath come unto them and from asking foregiveness of their lord but that there may come unto them the dispensation of the ancient or that the torment may come unto them face to face
Al-Kahf,39,-0.6836,0.253,0.635,0.112,and we send not apostle save a bringers of glad tidings and warner and those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood that they rebut thereby the truth and they take my sign and that whereof they are warned a mockery
Al-Kahf,64,-0.0772,0.084,0.837,0.079,and who doth greater wrong than he who is admonished with the sign of his lord yet turneth away from them and forgetteth that which his hand have sent forth verily we have set up veil over lest they should understand it and in their ear heaviness and if thou callest them to the guidance lo they will not let themselves be guided ever
Al-Kahf,44,0.3818,0.0,0.921,0.079,and thy lord is the forgiver owner of mercy were he to call them to account for that which they have earned he would have hastened for them torment but for them is tryst beside which they cannot find place to betake themselves to
Al-Kahf,18,-0.875,0.4,0.6,0.0,and these city we destroyed them when they did wrong and we had appointed for their destruction tryst
Al-Kahf,26,-0.0191,0.041,0.959,0.0,and recall what time musa said unto his page shall not cease until reach the confluence of the two sea or shall go on for age
Al-Kahf,23,0.5106,0.0,0.83,0.17,and when the twain reached the confluence of the two they forgot their fish and it took it way into the sea freely
Al-Kahf,27,0.3818,0.0,0.906,0.094,and when the twain had passed by he said unto his page bring u our morning meal assuredly we have met from this journey of ours toil
Al-Kahf,35,0.3291,0.06,0.845,0.095,he said lookest thou when we betook ourselves to the rock then forgot the fish and naught but the satan made me forget to mention it and it took it way into the sea marvel
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said that is that which we have been seeking so they turned back upon their footstep retracing
Al-Kahf,25,0.3612,0.0,0.902,0.098,then the twain found bondman from our bondman him we had vouchsafed mercy from before u and him we had taught from our presence knowledge
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said unto him shall follow thee that thou mayest teach me of that which thou hast been taught directive knowledge
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said verily thou wilt not be able to have with me patience
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how canst thou have patience over that which thy knowledge encompasseth not
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said thou wilt find me if allah will patient and shall not disobey thee in any affair
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said then if thou wilt follow me ask me not of anything until begin thereof some mention
Al-Kahf,32,-0.4588,0.17,0.711,0.119,then the twain journeyed until when they embarked in boat he scuttled it musa said hast thou scuttled it that thou mayest drown the people thereof assuredly thou hast committed thing grievous
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said said not that thou wouldst not be able to have with me patience
Al-Kahf,17,-0.6597,0.314,0.686,0.0,musa said take me not to task for that forget and impose not in my affair hardship
Al-Kahf,31,0.1531,0.117,0.699,0.184,then the twain journeyed until when they met boy and he killed him musa said hast thou slain person innocent not in return for person assuredly thou hast committed thing formidable
Al-Kahf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,he said said not unto thee that thou wouldst by no mean be able to have with me patience
Al-Kahf,24,-0.1793,0.092,0.804,0.103,musa said if ask thee regarding aught after this company not with me surely there hath reached to thee from my side an excuse
Al-Kahf,52,0.0387,0.05,0.897,0.053,then the twain journeyed until when they came unto the people of city they begged food from the people thereof but they refused to entertain the twain then they found therein wall about to fall down and he set it upright musa said hadst thou willed thou mightest have taken therefor hire
Al-Kahf,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said this shall be the parting between me and thee now shall declare unto thee the interpretation of that wherewith thou wast not able to have patience
Al-Kahf,29,-0.7624,0.202,0.798,0.0,a for the boat it belonged to poor men working in the sea so intended to damage it for there wa before them prince taking every boat by force
Al-Kahf,22,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,and a for the boy his parent were believer and we apprehended that he might impose upon the twain exorbitance and infidelity
Al-Kahf,21,0.743,0.0,0.751,0.249,so we intended that their lord should change for the twain one better than he in piety and closer in affection
Al-Kahf,73,0.7096,0.0,0.908,0.092,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the town and underneath it wa treasure belonging to them and their father had been righteous so thy lord intended that the twain should attain their maturity and bring forth for themselves their treasure a mercy from thy lord and did it not of mine own command that is the interpretation of that wherewith thou wast not able to have patience
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask thee of zul qarnain say thou shall recite unto you of him some mention
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,verily we we established him in the earth and vouchsafed unto him of everything way
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he followed way
Al-Kahf,40,0.4588,0.074,0.766,0.16,until when he reached the setting place of the sun he perceived it setting in miry spring and he found beside it nation we said zul qarnian either chastise them or take in respect of them the way of kindness
Al-Kahf,31,-0.4767,0.097,0.903,0.0,he said a for him who doeth wrong presently we shall torment him and thereafter he shall be brought back to his lord and he shall torment him with torment formidable
Al-Kahf,27,0.4404,0.0,0.896,0.104,and a for him who believeth and worketh righteously unto him shall be goodly hire and anon we shall speak unto him of our affair something easy
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereafter he followed way
Al-Kahf,25,0.1027,0.0,0.945,0.055,until when he reached the rising place of the sun he perceived it rising upon nation for whom against it we had not set veil
Al-Kahf,15,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172,thus it wa and surely we have encompassed all that wa with him in knowledge

Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said then what happened to the former generation
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said the knowledge there of is with my lord in the book my lord erreth not nor he forgetteth
Ta-Ha,34,0.5106,0.0,0.907,0.093,who hath appointed for you the earth a bed and hath opened for you therein pathway and hath sent down from the heaven water and thereby we have brought forth kind of plant various

Ta-Ha,18,0.25,0.0,0.895,0.105,thereof we created you and thereunto we return you and therefrom we shall bring you forth once again
Ta-Ha,15,-0.25,0.159,0.739,0.102,and assuredly we shewed him our sign all of them but he belied and refused
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said art thou come unto u that thou mayest drive u out of our land by thy magic musa
Ta-Ha,30,0.8183,0.0,0.753,0.247,so we shall surely bring unto thee magic the like thereof so make between u and thee an appointment which neither we nor thou shall fail in some open space
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said your appointment is the gala day and that the people be gathered in the forenoon
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then firawn turned away devised his stratagem thereafter he came
Ta-Ha,24,0.0258,0.101,0.794,0.105,musa said unto them woe unto you fabricate not against allah lie lest he extirpate you with torment and surely he who fabricateth loseth
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they wrangled about their affair among themselves and kept secret their private counsel
Ta-Ha,26,0.5423,0.0,0.877,0.123,they said verily these two are magician intending to drive you forth from your land by their magic and to do away with your superior way
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,wherefore devise your stratagem and then come in row and prospered to day is he who overcometh
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said either thou cast down or we shall be the first to cast down
Ta-Ha,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said nay cast ye down and lo their cord and their stave were made to appear to him by their magic a though they were running
Ta-Ha,9,-0.5413,0.304,0.696,0.0,then kind of fear in his soul musa felt
Ta-Ha,11,0.0772,0.204,0.573,0.223,we said fear not verily thou thou shalt be the superior
Ta-Ha,34,0.4939,0.0,0.912,0.088,and cast thou down that which is in thy right hand it shall swallow up that which they have wrought they have wrought only magician stratagem and the magician prospereth not wheresoever he cometh
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the magician were cast down prostrate they said we believe in the lord of musa and harun
Ta-Ha,60,0.8211,0.087,0.733,0.18,fir awn said believed ye in him ere gave you leave verily he is your chief who hath taught you magic so will surely cut off your hand and foot on the opposite side and will surely crucify you on the trunk of palm tree and ye shall surely know whichever of u is severer in torment and more lasting
Ta-Ha,45,0.4404,0.047,0.846,0.108,they said we shall by no mean prefer thee to that which hath come to u of the evidence and to him who hath created u so decree thou whatsoever thou shalt decree thou canst only decree in respect of the life of this world

Ta-Ha,19,-0.3515,0.194,0.674,0.132,verily whosoever cometh unto his lord a culprit for him is hell wherein he will neither die nor live
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and whosoever cometh unto him a believer and he hath done righteous work then these for them are rank high
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,garden everlasting whereunder river flow abiders therein that is the meed of him who hath purified himself
Ta-Ha,32,-0.1531,0.089,0.838,0.073,and assuredly we revealed unto musa saying depart in night with my bondman and make for them in the sea parth dry thou shalt fear neither overtaking nor shalt thou be afraid
Ta-Ha,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then fir awn followed them with his host and there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and fir awn led his nation astray and guided them not
Ta-Ha,30,-0.5423,0.108,0.892,0.0,child of israel we delivered you from your enemy and treated with you on the right side of the mount and sent down upon you the manna and the quail
Ta-Ha,33,0.4671,0.067,0.786,0.147,saying eat of the clean thing wherewith we have provided you and wax not exorbitant in respect thereof lest my wrath alight on you and upon whomsoever my wrath alighteth he surely perisheth
Ta-Ha,20,0.4927,0.0,0.856,0.144,and verily am the most forgiving unto whomsoever repenteth and believeth and worketh righteously and thereafter letteth himself remain guided
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and what hath made thee hasten from thy people musa
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said those they are close on my footstep and hastened to thee my lord that thou mightest be wellpleased
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said verily we have tempted thy people after thee and the samiri hath led them astray
Ta-Ha,52,0.0094,0.147,0.691,0.163,so musa returned unto his people indignant and sorrowful he said my people promised there not your lord unto you an excellent promise lasted then the covenant too long for you or desired ye that the wrath from your lord should alight on you so that ye failed to keep my appointment
Ta-Ha,32,-0.25,0.065,0.901,0.035,they said we failed not to keep thy appointment of our own authority but we were laden with burthen of the people ornament then we threw them and thus samiri cast down
Ta-Ha,25,0.2732,0.074,0.777,0.148,and he produced for them calf body with low then they said this is your god and the god of musa and that he forgat
Ta-Ha,18,0.6884,0.0,0.738,0.262,observed they not that it returned not unto them word and owned not for them hurt or profit
Ta-Ha,30,0.7003,0.0,0.828,0.172,and assuredly harun had said unto them afore my people ye are only being tempted thereby and verily your lord is the compassionate so follow me and obey my command
Ta-Ha,19,-0.296,0.115,0.885,0.0,they said we shall by no mean cease to be assiduous to it until there returneth to u musa
Ta-Ha,12,0.0258,0.0,0.909,0.091,musa said harun what prevented thee when thou sawest them going astray
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that thou followedst me not hast thou disobeyed my command
Ta-Ha,36,-0.4939,0.084,0.916,0.0,harun said my mother son hold me not by my beard nor by my head verily feared that thou wouldst say thou hast caused division among the child of israel and hast not guarded my word
Ta-Ha,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa said what wa thy object samiri
Ta-Ha,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said saw that which they saw not so seized handful from the footstep of the messenger and then cast it thus my soul embellished the affair to me
Ta-Ha,54,-0.4404,0.128,0.792,0.081,musa said begone thou verily it shall be thine in life to say no contact and verily thine is an appointment which thou shalt by no mean fail and look at thy god to which thou hast been assidauous we shall surely burn it and we shall scatter it into the sea wide scattering
Ta-Ha,19,0.25,0.098,0.714,0.188,your god is only allah the one other than whom there is no god he comprehendeth everything in knowledge
Ta-Ha,24,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,thus we recount unto thee some tidings of that which hath preceded and surely we have vouchsafed unto thee from before u an admonition
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,whosoever turnoth away therefrom verily they shall bear on the day of judgment burthen
Ta-Ha,15,-0.6249,0.255,0.745,0.0,a abiders therein and vile will load them on the day of judgment a load
Ta-Ha,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day whereon the trumpet will be blown into and we shall gather the culprit on that day blear eyed
Ta-Ha,9,-0.3875,0.247,0.753,0.0,mutterin among themselves ye tarried not save ten day
Ta-Ha,26,0.7765,0.077,0.676,0.247,we are the best knower of that which they will say when the best of them in judgment will say ye tarried not save for day
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask thee regarding the mountain so say thou my lord will scatter them with total scattering
Ta-Ha,7,-0.0516,0.167,0.833,0.0,then he shall leave it plain level
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,wherein thou shalt not see any crookedness or ruggedness
Ta-Ha,31,0.25,0.064,0.843,0.093,that day they shall follow the caller for whom there shall be no crookedness and voice shall be humbled for the compassionate so that thou shalt not hear ought except pattering
Ta-Ha,21,0.7096,0.047,0.711,0.241,that day intercession will profit not except him for whom the compassionate giveth leave and of whom he approveth the word
Ta-Ha,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he knoweth that which is before them and that which is behind them and they encompass it not with their knowledge
Ta-Ha,19,-0.8402,0.36,0.64,0.0,and downcast will be face before the living the self subsisting and disappointed will be he who beareth wrong
Ta-Ha,17,0.6348,0.0,0.743,0.257,and whosoever worketh of the righteous work and is believer he will not fear wrong or begrudging
Ta-Ha,32,-0.765,0.18,0.82,0.0,and thus we have sent it down an arabic recitation and have propounded variously therein of the threat that haply they may fear or that it may generate in them some admonition
Ta-Ha,32,0.6249,0.0,0.855,0.145,exalted is allah the true king and hasten thee not with the qur an before there is finished to thee the revelation thereof and say thou my lord increase me in knowledge
Ta-Ha,17,0.3818,0.0,0.86,0.14,and assuredly we covenanted with adam aforetime then he forgat and we found not in him steadiness
Ta-Ha,22,0.3252,0.0,0.9,0.1,and recall what time we said to the angel prostrate yourselves before adam they fell prostrate but iblis did not he refused
Ta-Ha,29,-0.5423,0.111,0.889,0.0,then we said adam verily this is an enemy unto thee and thine spouse so let him not drive forth you twain from the garden lest thou be destressed
Ta-Ha,13,0.1877,0.0,0.873,0.127,verily it is thine that thou shalt not hunger therein nor go naked
Ta-Ha,12,0.431,0.0,0.794,0.206,nor that thou shalt thirst therein nor shall suffer from the sun
Ta-Ha,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the satan whispered unto him he said adam shall direct thee to the tree of eternity and dominion that ageth not
Ta-Ha,34,-0.4767,0.086,0.914,0.0,then the twain ate thereof so there became disclosed to them their shame and they began sewing upon them self some of the leaf of the garden so adam disobeyed his lord and erred
Ta-Ha,12,0.2732,0.0,0.84,0.16,thereafter his lord accepted him and relented toward him and guided him
Ta-Ha,36,-0.2887,0.088,0.854,0.059,he said get ye twain down therefrom together some of you an enemy unto some others then if there cometh unto you from me guidance whosoever followeth my guidance shall neither go astray nor be distressed
Ta-Ha,26,0.2023,0.0,0.933,0.067,and whosoever turneth away from my admonition for him verily will be livelihood shrunken and we shall raise him up on the day of judgment sightless
Ta-Ha,16,0.4404,0.0,0.838,0.162,he will say my lord why hast thou gathered me sightless whereas surely have been seer
Ta-Ha,21,0.2682,0.093,0.77,0.137,allah will say thus came our sign unto thee and thou ignoredst them so that wise today thou shalt be ignored
Ta-Ha,28,0.0018,0.091,0.818,0.091,thus we requite him who trespasseth and believeth not in the sign of his lord and surely the torment of the hereafter is most severe and most lasting
Ta-Ha,29,-0.4767,0.106,0.858,0.036,hath it not served a guidance to them how many generation we have destroyed before them amidst whose dwelling they walk verily therein are sign for men of sagacity
Ta-Ha,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,and had not word from thy lord gone forth and term determined it must necessarily have come
Ta-Ha,45,0.7579,0.0,0.869,0.131,so bear thou patiently that which they say and hallow the praise of thy lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting thereof and hallow him in part of the night and the end of the day haply thou wilt be pleased
Ta-Ha,42,0.886,0.024,0.763,0.213,and strain not thine eye after that which we have given class of them to enjoy the splendour of the life of the world that we might try them therein and the provision of thy lord is the best and most lasting
Ta-Ha,28,0.5719,0.0,0.879,0.121,and command thy household for prayer and persevere thou therein we ask not of thee any provision we who provide thee and the happy end is for piety
Ta-Ha,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they say wherefore bringeth he not unto u sign from his lord hath not there came unto them the evidence of that which is in the former scripture
Ta-Ha,37,-0.6908,0.198,0.736,0.067,and had we destroyed them with torment before it surely they would have said our lord why sent not thou unto u an apostle that we might have followed thy sign before we were disgraced and humiliated
Ta-Ha,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,say thou everyone is on the watch so watch and anon ye shall know who are the fellow of thee even path and who hath let himself be guided
Al-Anbiya,14,-0.4588,0.188,0.812,0.0,there hath approached unto mankind their reckoning while they in neglect are turning away
Al-Anbiya,19,0.1825,0.072,0.822,0.106,there cometh not unto them fresh admonition from their lord but they listen to it while they are playing
Al-Anbiya,33,0.296,0.056,0.854,0.09,in sport being their heart and those who do wrong keep secret their private discourse this is but human being like unto yourselves will ye then betake yourselves to magic while ye know
Al-Anbiya,21,0.5106,0.0,0.858,0.142,the prophet said my lord knoweth the word in the heaven and the earth and he is the hearer the knower
Al-Anbiya,28,0.25,0.0,0.926,0.074,aye they say medley of dream aye he hath fabricated it aye he is poet so let him bring u sign even a the ancient were sent with
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,not city before them which we destroyed believed will they then believe
Al-Anbiya,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent not before thee but men unto whom we revealed so ask the people of the admonition if ye know not
Al-Anbiya,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made them not body not eating food nor were they to be abiders
Al-Anbiya,22,-0.0772,0.123,0.766,0.111,then we made good unto them the premise so we delivered them and those whom we willed and we destroyed the extravagant
Al-Anbiya,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,and assuredly we have sent down unto you book wherein is admonition for you will ye not then reflect
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.4767,0.134,0.866,0.0,and how many city have we overthrown which were doing wrong and we caused to grow up thereafter anot her nation
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.6249,0.272,0.728,0.0,then when they perceived our violence lo they were from it fleeing
Al-Anbiya,17,-0.1027,0.08,0.92,0.0,flee not and return unto that wherein ye luxuriated and your habitation haply ye will be questioned
Al-Anbiya,11,-0.7096,0.424,0.576,0.0,they said woe unto u verily we have been wrong doer
Al-Anbiya,14,-0.4767,0.193,0.807,0.0,and this ceased not to be their cry until we made them harvestreaped extinguished
Al-Anbiya,17,0.1774,0.128,0.663,0.209,and we created not the heaven and the earth and that which is in between in play
Al-Anbiya,24,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,had we intended that we should choose sport surely we would choose it from before u if we were ever going to do that
Al-Anbiya,27,-0.128,0.093,0.831,0.076,aye we hurl truth against false hood so that it braineth it and lo it vanisheth and to you be the woe for that which ye utter
Al-Anbiya,28,0.7441,0.0,0.774,0.226,and his is whosoever is in the heaven and the earth and those nigh unto him are not too stiff necked for his worship nor are they weary
Al-Anbiya,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they hallow him night and day and they flag not
Al-Anbiya,11,0.2732,0.0,0.826,0.174,have they taken god from the earth who raise the deed
Al-Anbiya,31,0.0516,0.103,0.761,0.136,had there been in between the twain god except allah surely the twain would have gone to ruin hallowed be allah the lord of the throne from that which they utter
Al-Anbiya,16,-0.2023,0.177,0.823,0.0,he shall be questioned not a to that which he doth while they shall be questioned

Al-Anbiya,22,0.4748,0.101,0.686,0.213,and we sent not before thee an apostle but we revealed unto him that there is no god but so worship me
Al-Anbiya,16,0.4939,0.0,0.824,0.176,and they say the compaionate hath taken son hallowed be he aye they are bondman honoured
Al-Anbiya,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they precede him not in word and by his command they work
Al-Anbiya,29,-0.4939,0.103,0.897,0.0,he knoweth whatsoever is before them and whatsoever is behind them and they intercede not except for him whom he approveth and in awe of him they are fearful
Al-Anbiya,24,-0.765,0.25,0.682,0.068,and whosoever of them should say verily am god beside him such one we shall requite with hell thus we requite the wrong doer
Al-Anbiya,32,0.6355,0.0,0.853,0.147,have not these who disbelieve considered that the heaven and the earth were closed up then we rent them and we have made of water everything living will they not then believe
Al-Anbiya,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have placed in the earth firm mountain lest it should move away with them and we placed therein passage for path that haply they may be guided
Al-Anbiya,17,0.7351,0.0,0.708,0.292,and we have made the heaven roof safe and from the sign there of they are averters
Al-Anbiya,23,0.25,0.0,0.917,0.083,and he it is who hath created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each in an orb floating
Al-Anbiya,20,0.25,0.0,0.905,0.095,and we appointed not for any human being before thee immortality if thou then diest are they to be immortal
Al-Anbiya,26,-0.7506,0.258,0.652,0.09,every soul is going to taste of death and we shall prove you with evil and good a temptation and unto u ye shall be returned
Al-Anbiya,32,0.2023,0.119,0.741,0.14,and when those who disbelieve behold thee they only take thee up for mockery is this he who mentioneth your god while in the mention of the compassionate they are themselves blasphemer
Al-Anbiya,17,0.5994,0.0,0.754,0.246,man wa created of hast surely shall show you my sign so ask me not to hasten
Al-Anbiya,12,0.3182,0.0,0.827,0.173,and they say when cometh this torment if ye are truth teller
Al-Anbiya,33,-0.5574,0.129,0.871,0.0,if only those who disbelieve have known of the time when they shall not be able to ward off from their face the fire nor from their back nor shall they be succoured
Al-Anbiya,25,-0.2023,0.109,0.891,0.0,aye it would come upon them on sudden and shall dumbfound them they shall not be able to avert it nor shall they be respited
Al-Anbiya,22,-0.34,0.188,0.714,0.098,and assuredly mocked were the apostle before thee then there surrounded those of them who scoffed that whereat they had been mocking
Al-Anbiya,23,0.3612,0.066,0.811,0.124,say thou who guardeth you by night and by day from the compassionate yet from the remembrance of their lord they avert themselves
Al-Anbiya,24,0.2732,0.0,0.909,0.091,have they god who defend them beside u they are not able to succour themselves and against u they cannot be kept company with
Al-Anbiya,38,0.4939,0.0,0.92,0.08,aye we let these people and their father enjoy until there grew long upon them the life behold they not that we come unto the land diminishing it by the border thereof shall they then be the victor
Al-Anbiya,20,-0.3612,0.163,0.837,0.0,say thou only warn you by the revelation and the deaf hearken not unto the call when they are warned
Al-Anbiya,24,-0.7096,0.219,0.781,0.0,and if breath of the torment of thy lord were to touch them they will say woe unto u we have been wrong doer
Al-Anbiya,41,-0.09,0.083,0.865,0.051,and we shall set balance of justice for the day of judgment then no soul shall be wronged at all and if it be but the weight of grain of mustard seed we shall bring it and we suffice a reckoner
Al-Anbiya,19,0.0,0.152,0.656,0.193,and assuredly we vcuchsafed unto musa and harun the distinction and illumination and an admonition for the god fearing
