Al-Baqarah,71,-0.5574,0.092,0.878,0.031,indeed allah doe not for the sake of explanation shy to illustrate an example of anything whether it is of gnat or something further inferior than it so the believer know it is the truth from their lord a for the disbeliever they say what doe allah intend by such an example he misleads many thereby and he guide many thereby and with it he misleads only those who are rebellious
Al-Baqarah,35,-0.886,0.294,0.609,0.097,those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever what allah ha ordered to join and who cause turmoil evil religious chaos in the earth it is they who are the loser

Al-Baqarah,52,0.7003,0.043,0.83,0.126,and remember when your lord said to the angel am about to place my caliph in the earth they said will you place a caliph one who will spread turmoil in it and shed blood whereas we glorify you with praise and proclaim your sanctity he said know what you do not
Al-Baqarah,28,0.765,0.0,0.798,0.202,and allah the supreme taught adam all the name of thing then presented them to the angel saying tell me the name of these if you are truthful
Al-Baqarah,27,0.4767,0.0,0.89,0.11,they said purity is to you we do not have any knowledge except what you have taught u indeed you only are the all knowing the wise
Al-Baqarah,43,0.3818,0.037,0.891,0.072,he said adam inform them the name and when adam had informed them their name he said did not tell you that know all the secret of the heaven and the earth and know all what you disclose and all what you hide
Al-Baqarah,27,-0.5423,0.196,0.712,0.092,and remember when we ordered the angel to prostrate before adam so they all prostrated except iblis satan devil he refused and wa proud and became disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,34,0.431,0.0,0.865,0.135,and we said adam you and your wife dwell in this garden and eat freely from it wherever you please but do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress
Al-Baqarah,41,-0.8473,0.173,0.827,0.0,so the devil destabilised them in it and removed them from where they were and we said go down one of you is an enemy to the other and for fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it
Al-Baqarah,29,0.4939,0.0,0.865,0.135,then adam learnt from his lord certain word of revelation therefore allah accepted his repentance indeed he only is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful see verse
Al-Baqarah,31,0.8575,0.0,0.748,0.252,we said go down from paradise all of you then if some guidance come to you from me so whoever follows my guidance for such is neither fear nor any grief

Al-Baqarah,20,0.34,0.063,0.811,0.126,and keep the obligatory prayer established and pay the charity and bow your head with those who bow in prayer
Al-Baqarah,23,-0.2263,0.079,0.921,0.0,what you enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget to practise it yourselves whereas you read the book do you not have sense
Al-Baqarah,21,0.6369,0.056,0.72,0.224,and seek help in patience and prayer and truly it is hard except for those who prostrate before me with sincerity
Al-Baqarah,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who know that they have to meet their lord and that it is to him they are to return
Al-Baqarah,29,0.8074,0.0,0.758,0.242,descendant of israel remember the favour of mine which bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time by sending the noble messenger to your nation
Al-Baqarah,38,-0.0,0.121,0.759,0.121,and fear the day of resurrection when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will any intercession be accepted for the disbeliever nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will they be helped
Al-Baqarah,34,0.8271,0.067,0.69,0.244,and remember when we rescued you from firaun people for they were inflicting you with dreadful torment slaying your son and sparing your daughter that wa tremendous trial from your lord or great reward
Al-Baqarah,21,-0.5994,0.163,0.837,0.0,and when we split the sea for you thereby rescuing you and drowned the firaun people in front of your eye
Al-Baqarah,23,0.2263,0.116,0.702,0.182,and when we made commitment with moosa moses for forty night then behind him you started worshipping the calf and you were unjust
Al-Baqarah,12,0.5994,0.0,0.671,0.329,then after that we pardoned you so that you may be grateful
Al-Baqarah,23,-0.4767,0.124,0.876,0.0,and when we gave moosa the book taurat torah and the criterion to judge right from wrong so that you may attain guidance
Al-Baqarah,58,-0.34,0.114,0.778,0.108,and when moosa said to his people my people you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf therefore turn in repentance to your creator therefore kill each other this is better for you before your creator he therefore accepted your repentance indeed he only is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful a your deity for worship
Al-Baqarah,24,0.4019,0.0,0.895,0.105,and when you said moosa we will not believe you till we clearly see allah so the thunder seized you while you were watching
Al-Baqarah,16,-0.2263,0.187,0.67,0.144,then we brought you back to life after your death so that you may be grateful
Al-Baqarah,39,-0.4719,0.092,0.865,0.043,and we made the cloud canopy for you and sent down manna and salwa bird on you eat of the pure thing we have provided you they did not wrong u in the least but indeed they wronged themselves
Al-Baqarah,44,0.6597,0.125,0.64,0.235,and when we said enter this town and eat freely from what is in it and enter the gate whilst prostrating and say may our sin be forgiven we will forgive you your sin and we will soon increase the reward for the righteous
Al-Baqarah,28,-0.8674,0.252,0.748,0.0,but the unjust changed the word that had been ordered for another one so we sent down punishment on them from the sky the recompense of their disobedience
Al-Baqarah,49,-0.1531,0.076,0.878,0.046,and when moosa asked for water for his people we said strike this rock with your staff thereupon twelve spring gushed forth from it each group recognised it drinking place eat and drink from what allah ha provided and do not roam about the earth making turmoil in it
Al-Baqarah,97,-0.6705,0.104,0.843,0.052,and when you said moosa we shall never put up with only one kind of food so call upon your lord to produce for u what the earth grows some herb cucumber corn lentil and onion he said what you wish to exchange the better for something inferior therefore settle down in egypt or any city where you will get what you demand and disgrace and misery were destined for them and they returned towards allah wrath that wa because they disbelieved in allah sign and wrongfully martyred the prophet that wa for their disobedience and transgression
Al-Baqarah,50,0.8975,0.083,0.649,0.267,indeed the believer the muslim and those among the jew the christian and the sabeans who sincerely accept faith in allah and the last day and do good deed their reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve convert to islam
Al-Baqarah,34,0.3818,0.0,0.927,0.073,and when we made covenant with you and raised the mount above you accept and hold fast to what we give you and remember what is in it so that you may attain piety
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.2263,0.122,0.789,0.09,then after that you turned away and were it not for the munificence of allah and his mercy you would be among the loser
Al-Baqarah,25,-0.0516,0.096,0.78,0.124,and you certainly know of those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of sabth sabbath saturday we therefore said to them become ape despised
Al-Baqarah,26,0.2023,0.081,0.811,0.108,so we made this incident of that town warning to the surrounding town others of their time and to succeeding generation and lesson for the pious
Al-Baqarah,32,-0.0258,0.123,0.784,0.092,and remember when moosa said to his people allah command you to sacrifice cow they said are you making fun of u he answered allah forbid that should be of the ignorant
Al-Baqarah,36,0.1655,0.0,0.955,0.045,they said pray to your lord that he may describe the cow said moosa he say that it is cow neither old nor very young but between the two condition so do what you are commanded
Al-Baqarah,30,0.8225,0.0,0.751,0.249,they said pray to your lord that he may reveal it colour to u answered moosa indeed he say it is yellow cow of bright colour pleasing to the beholder
Al-Baqarah,34,0.3008,0.076,0.789,0.136,they said pray to your lord that he may clearly describe the cow to u we are really in doubt a to which cow it is and if allah will we will attain guidance
Al-Baqarah,44,0.2846,0.0,0.952,0.048,said moosa he say she is cow not made to work neither ploughing the soil nor watering the field flawless and spotless they said you have now conveyed the proper fact so they sacrificed it but seemed not to be sacrificing it with sincerity
Al-Baqarah,23,-0.5423,0.216,0.784,0.0,and remember when you slew man and were therefore accusing each other concerning it and allah wanted to expose what you were hiding
Al-Baqarah,33,-0.8779,0.252,0.748,0.0,we therefore said strike the dead man with part of the sacrificed cow this is how allah will bring the dead to life and show you his sign so that you may understand
Al-Baqarah,56,0.0402,0.053,0.875,0.072,then after it your heart hardened so they are like rock or even harder for there are some rock that river gush forth from them and some that water flow from them when they split asunder and there are rock that fall down for the fear of allah and allah is not unaware of your deed
Al-Baqarah,34,0.7964,0.0,0.793,0.207,so muslim do you wish for the jew to accept faith in you whereas group of them used to listen to the word of allah and then after having understood it purposely changed it
Al-Baqarah,49,-0.564,0.121,0.824,0.056,and when they meet the believer they say we believe but when they are in isolation with one another they say you clarify to the believer from what allah ha disclosed to you so that they may evidence it against you before your lord so have you no sense
Al-Baqarah,15,-0.1779,0.108,0.892,0.0,do they not know that allah know all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose
Al-Baqarah,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the book except to recite something therefrom or part of their own fabrication they are in absolute illusion
Al-Baqarah,50,0.34,0.135,0.707,0.158,therefore woe is to those who write the book with their hand and they then claim this is from allah in order to gain an abject worldly price for it therefore woe to them for what their hand have written and woe to them for what they earn with it
Al-Baqarah,42,0.34,0.053,0.819,0.128,and they said the fire will not touch u except for certain number of day say have you taken covenant from allah then allah will certainly not break his covenant or do you say something concerning allah what you do not know
Al-Baqarah,34,-0.9403,0.362,0.582,0.056,yes why not the one who earns evil and his sin surround him he is from the people of fire hell they will remain in it forever you will remain in the fire forever
Al-Baqarah,20,0.7964,0.0,0.717,0.283,and those who believe and do good deed they are the people of paradise they will abide in it forever
Al-Baqarah,56,0.6384,0.088,0.774,0.138,and remember when we took covenant from the descendant of israel that do not worship anyone except allah and be good to parent relative orphan and the needy and speak kindly to people and keep the prayer established and pay the charity thereafter you retracted except some of you and you are those who turn away
Al-Baqarah,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when we took covenant from you that do not shed the blood of your own people nor turn out your own people from your colony you then acknowledged it and you are witness
Al-Baqarah,101,-0.9388,0.187,0.747,0.066,then it is you who began slaying each other and you drive out group of your people from their homeland providing support against them to their opponent through sin and injustice and if they come to you a captive you redeem them whereas their expulsion itself is forbidden to you so do you believe in some of allah command and disbelieve in some so what is the reward of those who do so except disgrace in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be assigned to the most grievous punishment and allah is not unaware of your deed
Al-Baqarah,26,-0.539,0.122,0.878,0.0,these are the people who bought the worldly life in exchange of the hereafter so their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be helped
Al-Baqarah,71,0.5667,0.095,0.754,0.151,and indeed we gave moosa moses the book and subsequent to him sent noble messenger one after another and we gave eisa jesus the son of maryam mary clear proof and supported him with the holy spirit so when noble messenger from allah come to you bringing what you yourselves do not desire you grow arrogant so you disbelieve in group of the prophet and another group of prophet you slay
Al-Baqarah,25,0.7783,0.0,0.738,0.262,and the jew said our heart are covered in fact allah ha cursed them because of their disbelief so only few of them accept faith
Al-Baqarah,72,0.5367,0.044,0.868,0.088,and when the book from allah the holy qu ran came to them which confirms the book in their possession the taurat torah and before that they used to seek victory through the medium of this very prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him over the disbeliever so when the one whom they fully recognised the holy prophet came to them they turned disbeliever therefore allah curse is upon the disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,49,-0.4939,0.146,0.764,0.09,how abject is the price for which they exchange their life that they should disbelieve in what allah ha sent down jealous that allah should reveal of his grace to whomever he will of his bondman so they deserved wrath upon wrath and for the disbeliever is disgraceful punishment
Al-Baqarah,65,0.8957,0.03,0.782,0.189,and when it is said to them believe in what allah ha sent down they say we believe in what wa sent down to u and disbelieve in the rest whereas it is the truth confirming what they posse say to them dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him why did you then martyr the earlier prophet if you believed in your book
Al-Baqarah,20,0.4588,0.124,0.639,0.237,and indeed moosa came to you with clear sign and after it you worshipped the calf and you were unjust
Al-Baqarah,71,0.8519,0.052,0.773,0.175,and remember when we made covenant with you and raised the mount tur sinai above you accept and hold fast to what we give you and listen they said we hear and we disobey and the calf wa still embedded in their heart because of their disbelief say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him what an evil command is what your faith order you if you are believer
Al-Baqarah,36,0.7506,0.122,0.622,0.255,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him if the abode of the hereafter in the sight of allah is for you alone and none else then long for death if you are truthful
Al-Baqarah,25,-0.7436,0.24,0.686,0.075,and they will never long for it because of the evil deed they have done in the past and allah know the unjust very well
Al-Baqarah,46,-0.3818,0.129,0.772,0.099,and you will surely find them the greediest among mankind for life and likewise among the polytheist idolater each one of them yearns to live thousand year and the grant of such age will not distance him from the punishment and allah is seeing their misdeed
Al-Baqarah,46,0.8807,0.06,0.687,0.253,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him whoever is an enemy to jibreel gabriel for it is he who ha brought down this qu ran to your heart by allah command confirming the book before it and guidance and glad tidings to muslim
Al-Baqarah,28,-0.6124,0.2,0.714,0.086,whoever is an enemy to allah and his angel and his noble messenger and jibreel and mikaeel michael then know that allah is an enemy of the disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,18,0.5405,0.0,0.781,0.219,we have indeed sent down to you clear sign and none will disbelieve in them except the sinner
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.3252,0.092,0.908,0.0,and is it that whenever they make covenant only group of them throw it aside in fact most of them do not have faith
Al-Baqarah,37,0.228,0.054,0.87,0.077,and when noble messenger from allah came to them confirming the book which they possessed group of those who have received the book flung the book of allah behind their back a if they were totally unaware
Al-Baqarah,142,0.4462,0.103,0.765,0.132,and they followed what the devil used to read during the rule of sulaiman solomon peace and blessing be upon him and sulaiman did not disbelieve but the devil disbelieved they teach people magic and that which wa sent down to the two angel harut and marut in babylon and the two angel never taught thing to anyone until they used to say we are only trial therefore do not lose your faith and they used to learn from them that by which they cause division between man and his wife and they cannot harm anyone by it except by allah command and they learn what will harm them not benefit them and surely they know that whoever bargain for this will not have share in the hereafter and for what an abject thing they have sold themselves if only they knew
Al-Baqarah,19,0.4927,0.0,0.849,0.151,and had they believed and been pious then the recompense from allah is extremely good if only they knew
Al-Baqarah,54,0.3612,0.166,0.618,0.216,people who believe do not say to the prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him raena be considerate towards u but say unzurna look mercifully upon u and listen attentively from the start and for the disbeliever is painful punishment to disrespect the holy prophet peace and blessing be upon him is blasphemy
Al-Baqarah,40,0.2363,0.097,0.785,0.118,those who disbelieve the people given the book or the polytheist do not wish that any good be sent down upon you from your lord and allah chooses whomever he will by his mercy and allah is the most munificent
Al-Baqarah,32,0.25,0.055,0.862,0.083,when we abrogate verse or cause it to be forgotten we will bring one better than it or one similar do you not know that allah is able to do all thing
Al-Baqarah,27,0.3582,0.06,0.83,0.11,do you not know that for allah only is the kingship of the heaven and the earth and except allah you have neither protector nor any supporter
Al-Baqarah,30,0.872,0.0,0.705,0.295,do you wish to ask your noble messenger question similar to what moosa wa asked before and whoever chooses disbelief instead of faith ha gone astray from the right path
Al-Baqarah,49,0.8713,0.063,0.691,0.246,many among people given the book wished to turn you to disbelief after you had accepted faith out of heart envy after the truth ha become very clear to them so leave them and be tolerant until allah brings his command indeed allah is able to do all thing
Al-Baqarah,29,0.6486,0.042,0.785,0.172,and keep the prayer established and pay the charity and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you will find it with allah indeed allah is seeing your deed
Al-Baqarah,39,0.8373,0.068,0.685,0.248,and the people given the book said none will enter paradise unless he is jew or christian these are their own imagination say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him bring your proof if you are truthful
Al-Baqarah,33,0.7639,0.122,0.608,0.27,yes why not whoever submits his face for the sake of allah and is virtuous his reward is with his lord and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
Al-Baqarah,45,-0.5719,0.1,0.877,0.023,and the jew said the christian are nothing and the christian said the jew are nothing whereas they both read the book and the ignorant spoke similarly so allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning the matter in which they dispute
Al-Baqarah,48,-0.9628,0.322,0.657,0.021,and who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of allah being mentioned in the mosque and strives for their ruin it did not befit them to enter the mosque except in fear for them is disgrace in this world and terrible punishment in the hereafter
Al-Baqarah,40,0.6369,0.0,0.856,0.144,and the east and the west all belong to allah so whichever direction you face there is allah entity allah mercy is directed towards you indeed allah is the all capable his power and reach are limitless the all knowing
Al-Baqarah,33,0.5267,0.061,0.789,0.15,and they said allah ha taken an offspring for himself purity is to him in fact all that is in the heaven and the earth is his dominion all are submissive to him
Al-Baqarah,23,0.5106,0.0,0.87,0.13,the originator of the heaven and the earth and when he command thing he only say to it be and it thereupon happens
Al-Baqarah,54,0.5106,0.038,0.865,0.097,and the ignorant people said why doe not allah speak to u or some sign come to u those before them had also spoken in the same way a they speak their heart and of those before them are all alike undoubtedly we have made the sign clear for the people who have faith
Al-Baqarah,34,0.8517,0.139,0.497,0.364,undoubtedly we have sent you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him with the truth giving glad tidings and conveying warning and you will not be questioned about the people of hell
Al-Baqarah,56,0.8689,0.0,0.828,0.172,and never will the jew or the christian be pleased with you until you follow their religion say the guidance of allah only is the true guidance and were you the follower of this prophet to follow their desire after the knowledge ha come to you you would then not have protector or aide against allah
Al-Baqarah,36,-0.7003,0.146,0.854,0.0,those to whom we have given the book read it in the manner it should be read it is they who believe in it and those who deny it it is they who are the loser
Al-Baqarah,28,0.8555,0.0,0.727,0.273,descendant of israel remember the favour of mine which bestowed upon you and made you superior to all others of your time by sending noble messenger among you
Al-Baqarah,34,0.2263,0.129,0.719,0.151,and fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will any intercession benefit the disbeliever nor will they be helped
Al-Baqarah,43,0.3616,0.065,0.797,0.138,and remember when ibrahim abraham lord tested him in some matter and he fulfilled them he said am going to appoint you a leader for mankind invoked ibrahim and of my offspring he said my covenant doe not include the unjust wrong doer
Al-Baqarah,62,0.2263,0.021,0.944,0.035,and remember when we made this house at mecca recourse for mankind and sanctuary and take the place where ibrahim stood a your place of prayer and we imposed duty upon ibrahim and ismail ishmael to fully purify my house for those who go around it and those who stay in it for worship and those who bow down and prostrate themselves
Al-Baqarah,64,-0.8316,0.142,0.824,0.034,and remember when ibrahim prayed my lord make this city place of security and bestow upon it people various fruit a providence for those among them who believe in allah and the last day of resurrection he answered and whoever disbelief shall provide him also some subsistence and then compel him towards the punishment of fire hell and that is wretched place to return

Al-Anam,40,0.4654,0.119,0.701,0.18,so indeed they denied the truth when it came to them so now the tidings of the thing they used to mock at will come to them prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him or the holy qur an
Al-Anam,56,-0.8402,0.156,0.812,0.031,do they not see how many civilisation we destroyed before them whom we had established more firmly in the earth than we have established you and we sent on them abundant rain from the sky and made the river flow beneath them so we destroyed them because of their sin and created another civilisation after them
Al-Anam,42,0.5383,0.058,0.77,0.172,and had we sent down to you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him something written on paper so that they could feel it with their hand even then the disbeliever would have said this is nothing but clear magic
Al-Anam,34,0.3612,0.0,0.901,0.099,and they said why ha not an angel been sent down to him and had we sent down an angel then the matter would have been finished and they would not get any respite
Al-Anam,29,-0.3612,0.091,0.909,0.0,and had we appointed an angel a prophet we would still have made him a man and would keep them in the same doubt a they are now in
Al-Anam,34,0.8709,0.159,0.49,0.352,and certainly dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him the noble messenger before you have also been mocked at so those who laughed at them were themselves ruined by their own mocking
Al-Anam,15,-0.4404,0.172,0.828,0.0,proclaim travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who denied
Al-Anam,55,0.2225,0.181,0.626,0.193,say to whom doe all whatever is in the heaven and the earth belong proclaim to allah he ha made mercy obligatory upon his grace undoubtedly he will surely gather you all together on the day of resurrection in which there is no doubt those who put their soul to ruin do not accept faith
Al-Anam,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and to him only belongs all whatever exists in the night and in the day and he only is the all hearing the all knowing

Al-Anam,15,-0.3182,0.284,0.533,0.182,say if disobey my lord then fear the punishment of the great day of resurrection
Al-Anam,23,0.8442,0.132,0.469,0.399,indeed allah mercy ha been upon him from whom the punishment ha been averted on that day and this is the clear success
Al-Anam,36,0.4404,0.0,0.923,0.077,and if allah afflicts you with some misfortune then there is none who can remove it except him and if he sends you some good fortune then know that he is able to do all thing
Al-Anam,14,0.4767,0.0,0.807,0.193,he is the omnipotent over his bondman and he is the wise the aware
Al-Anam,86,0.9553,0.017,0.769,0.214,proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him whose testimony is the greatest say allah is the witness between me and you and this qur an ha been sent down upon me so may warn you with it and whomever it may reach so do you bear witness that there are other god along with allah say do not bear witness to it say he is the only one god and do not have any relation with whatever you ascribe a partner to him
Al-Anam,36,-0.1571,0.185,0.666,0.149,the people to whom we gave the book recognise this prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him a they recognise their own son those who put their own soul to ruin do not accept faith
Al-Anam,22,-0.9121,0.412,0.588,0.0,and who is more unjust than one who fabricates lie against allah or denies his sign undoubtedly the unjust will never succeed
Al-Anam,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and on the day when we will resurrect everyone together then say to the polytheist where are those partner your false deity whom you professed
Al-Anam,17,-0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,then they had no fabrication except that they said by allah our lord we were never polytheist
Al-Anam,14,-0.5994,0.29,0.71,0.0,observe how they lied against themselves and how they lost the thing they fabricated
Al-Anam,66,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and among them is one who listens to you and we have put cover upon their heart so they may not understand it and deafness in their ear and even if they see all the sign they will not believe in them to the extent that when they come to you to debate with you the disbeliever say this is nothing but story of former people
Al-Anam,23,-0.7184,0.222,0.778,0.0,and they stop others from it and run away from it and they ruin none except themselves and they do not have sense
Al-Anam,34,-0.552,0.119,0.828,0.053,and if you see them when they will be placed above hell they will say ala if only we might be sent back and not deny the sign of our lord and become muslim
Al-Anam,36,-0.1531,0.173,0.667,0.16,in fact it ha become clear to them what they used to hide before and were they to be sent back they would commit the same which they were forbidden to and undoubtedly they are liar
Al-Anam,21,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,and they said there is no other life except our life of this world and we are not to be raised
Al-Anam,42,-0.3532,0.11,0.832,0.058,and if you see when they are placed before their lord he will say is this not real the truth they will say yes why not by our lord he will say so now taste the punishment the recompense of your disbelief
Al-Anam,48,-0.9702,0.36,0.64,0.0,those who denied their meeting with allah have indeed failed to the extent that when the last day suddenly came upon them they said woe to u that we failed to believe in it and they carry their burden on their back what an evil burden they carry
Al-Anam,29,0.4404,0.0,0.906,0.094,the life of this world is nothing except pastime and sport and undoubtedly the abode of the hereafter is better for the pious so do you not have sense
Al-Anam,32,0.1083,0.158,0.602,0.24,we know well that their statement grief you so they do not deny you prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him but in fact the unjust deny the sign of allah
Al-Anam,43,0.1119,0.163,0.63,0.207,and indeed noble messenger have been denied before you so they patiently bore the denial and torture till our help reached them and there is none to alter the decision of allah and the news of the noble messenger have already reached you
Al-Anam,53,-0.4019,0.089,0.87,0.042,and if their turning away ha grieved you then if you can seek tunnel into the earth or ladder into the sky to bring sign for them and if allah willed he could have brought them all together upon guidance so listener follower of this prophet do not ever be of the ignorant
Al-Anam,28,0.4215,0.118,0.659,0.223,it is only those who hear with sincere heart that accept faith and allah will raise these people dead of heart then towards him they will be herded
Al-Anam,31,-0.4569,0.136,0.814,0.049,and they said why ha no sign been sent down upon him from his lord say indeed allah is able to send down sign but most of them are totally ignorant
Al-Anam,38,0.5023,0.0,0.919,0.081,and there is not an animal moving in the earth nor bird flying on it wing but they are nation like you we have left out nothing in this book then towards their lord they will be raised
Al-Anam,31,-0.7003,0.21,0.738,0.052,and those who deny our sign are deaf and dumb in realm of darkness allah may send astray whomever he will and may place on the straight path whomever he will
Al-Anam,29,-0.0516,0.096,0.813,0.09,say what is your opinion if the punishment of allah come upon you or the hour arrives will you call upon anyone deity besides allah if you are truthful
Al-Anam,33,-0.2263,0.056,0.944,0.0,in fact you will only call upon him and if he will he may remove that because of which you prayed to him and you will forget the partner you ascribe to him
Al-Anam,31,-0.2732,0.141,0.776,0.083,and we have indeed sent noble messenger towards the nation that were before you we therefore seized them with hardship and adversity so that in some way they may humbly plead
Al-Anam,29,-0.6542,0.216,0.683,0.101,so why did they not humbly plead when our punishment came to them but their heart were hardened and the devil made all their deed appear good to them
Al-Anam,39,0.1531,0.073,0.841,0.086,so when they forgot the advice made to them we opened the gate of all thing for them to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received we seized them suddenly hence they remained dejected
Al-Anam,20,0.0772,0.199,0.59,0.21,the origin of the unjust people were therefore cut off and all praise is to allah lord of the creation
Al-Anam,44,0.5106,0.0,0.907,0.093,say what is your opinion if allah were to take away your hearing and your sight and seal your heart then is there god besides allah who could restore it for you observe how we explain the verse to them yet they turn away
Al-Anam,28,-0.7506,0.198,0.802,0.0,say what is your opinion if the punishment of allah were to come upon you suddenly or openly with forewarning who would be destroyed except the disbelieving people
Al-Anam,32,0.0783,0.234,0.524,0.241,and we did not send noble messenger except a herald of glad tidings and warning so upon those who accept faith and reform themselves shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
Al-Anam,14,-0.6808,0.318,0.682,0.0,and those who deny our sign the punishment will afflict them for their disobedience
Al-Anam,65,0.9442,0.034,0.73,0.236,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him do not say to you that posse the treasure of allah nor do say that gain knowledge of the hidden on my own nor do say to you that am an angel only follow what is divinely revealed to me say will the blind and the sighted ever be equal so do you not think
Al-Anam,38,-0.7003,0.163,0.837,0.0,and with this qur an warn those who fear that they will be raised towards their lord in state when except allah there will be no protector for them nor an intercessor so that they may be pious
Al-Anam,41,0.6341,0.082,0.77,0.148,and do not repel those who call upon their lord in the morning and evening seeking his pleasure you are not responsible for their account nor are they responsible for your account then your repelling them would be far from justice
Al-Anam,36,0.8402,0.056,0.678,0.266,and similarly we have made some a trial for others that the wealthy disbeliever upon seeing the needy muslim say are these whom allah ha favoured among u doe not allah recognise those who are thankful
Al-Anam,52,0.8625,0.056,0.705,0.238,and when those who believe in our sign come humbly in your presence say to them peace be upon you your lord ha prescribed mercy for himself by his grace that whoever among you commits sin by folly and thereafter repents and reform himself then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Anam,20,0.0258,0.184,0.627,0.188,and this is how we explain our verse clearly and so that the way of the criminal become well exposed
Al-Anam,33,-0.1675,0.132,0.754,0.114,say have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than allah say do not follow your desire if it were would then go astray and not be on the right path
Al-Anam,40,0.5106,0.136,0.681,0.182,say am on the clear proof from my lord whereas you deny him do not have what you are impatient for there is no command except that of allah he state the truth and he is the best of judge
Al-Anam,30,-0.5106,0.159,0.749,0.092,say if had the thing for which you are impatient then the matter between me and you would have already been decided and allah is well aware of the unjust
Al-Anam,58,-0.6341,0.11,0.863,0.027,and it is he who ha the key of the hidden only he know them and he know all that is in the land and the sea and no leaf fall but he know it and there is not grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything wet or dry which is not recorded in clear book

Al-Araf,40,0.802,0.091,0.671,0.238,dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him book ha been sent down upon you therefore may not your heart be disinclined towards it so that you may give warning with it and a an advice for the muslim
Al-Araf,29,-0.0516,0.081,0.844,0.075,mankind follow what ha been sent down to you from your lord and do not follow other administrator abandoning this the holy qur an very little do you understand
Al-Araf,21,-0.7893,0.269,0.731,0.0,and many township did we destroy so our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon
Al-Araf,19,-0.171,0.144,0.741,0.115,therefore they uttered nothing when our punishment came to them except that they said indeed we were the unjust
Al-Araf,20,0.7184,0.0,0.75,0.25,so undoubtedly we shall question those to whom our noble messenger went and indeed we shall question the noble messenger
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so indeed we shall inform them with our knowledge and we were not absent
Al-Araf,19,0.7717,0.0,0.717,0.283,and on that day the weighing will truly be done so those whose scale prove heavy are the successful
Al-Araf,26,-0.8176,0.238,0.762,0.0,and those whose scale are light are the people who put themselves to ruin the recompense of the injustice they used to do to our sign
Al-Araf,24,0.6893,0.0,0.759,0.241,and indeed we established you in the earth and in it created for you the mean of livelihood very little thanks do you offer
Al-Araf,31,0.25,0.0,0.938,0.062,and indeed we created you then designed you and then ordered the angel prostrate before adam so they all prostrated except iblis satan he did not become of those who prostrate
Al-Araf,30,0.5574,0.068,0.706,0.226,said allah what prevented you that you did not prostrate when commanded you answered iblis am better than him you created me from fire whereas you created him from clay
Al-Araf,24,0.0772,0.1,0.789,0.111,said allah therefore go down from here it doe not befit you to stay here and be proud exit you are of the degraded
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said give me respite till the day when people will be resurrected
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said allah you are given respite
Al-Araf,23,0.4767,0.047,0.784,0.169,he said hence swear by the fact that you sent me astray will certainly lay in wait for them on your straight path
Al-Araf,29,-0.1526,0.093,0.833,0.074,then will certainly approach them from their front and from behind them and from their right and from their left and you will find most of them not thankful
Al-Araf,21,-0.836,0.294,0.706,0.0,he said exit from here rejected outcast indeed whoever among them follows your bidding will fill hell with all of you
Al-Araf,32,0.8126,0.0,0.775,0.225,and said adam you and your wife dwell in paradise therefore eat from it from wherever you wish and do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress
Al-Araf,39,-0.5423,0.186,0.66,0.155,then satan created apprehension in their heart in order to disclose to them matter of their shame which were hidden from them and said your lord ha forbidden you from this tree for you may become angel or immortal
Al-Araf,13,0.2732,0.0,0.851,0.149,and he swore to them indeed am well wisher for both of you
Al-Araf,54,-0.5168,0.147,0.758,0.095,so he brought them down with deception and when they tasted from that tree their shame became manifest to them and they began attaching the leaf of paradise on themselves and their lord said to them did not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is an open enemy to you
Al-Araf,28,-0.4047,0.235,0.608,0.156,they both submitted our lord we have wronged ourselves so if you do not forgive u and have mercy on u then surely we are of the loser
Al-Araf,25,-0.4404,0.108,0.892,0.0,he said go down one of you is foe unto the other and for fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it
Al-Araf,19,-0.5994,0.178,0.822,0.0,he said you shall live there and there shall you die and from there only you will be raised
Al-Araf,41,0.6369,0.064,0.785,0.151,descendant of adam we have sent down to you garment to conceal your shame and another garment for your elegance and the garment of piety that is the best this is among the sign of allah so that they may remember
Al-Araf,61,-0.0935,0.108,0.79,0.103,descendant of adam beware do not let satan put you in trial the way he removed your parent from paradise and had their garment removed so that their shame become visible to them indeed he and his tribe see you from where you do not see them indeed we have made the devil the friend of those who do not believe
Al-Araf,40,0.3476,0.071,0.781,0.148,and when they commit any shameful act they say we found our forefather on it and allah ha commanded it to u say indeed allah doe not ordain shamelessness what you attribute thing to allah which you do not know
Al-Araf,38,0.926,0.0,0.645,0.355,say my lord ha ordained justice and set your attention straight every time you offer pray and worship him a only his devoted worshipper the way he brought you into being in the same manner will you return
Al-Araf,31,-0.0258,0.177,0.623,0.2,he ha guided one group and one group error ha been proved instead of allah they have chosen the devil a their friend and they assume that they are on guidance
Al-Araf,27,-0.0541,0.073,0.862,0.065,descendant of adam adorn yourself when you go to the mosque and eat and drink and do not cross limit indeed he doe not like the transgressor
Al-Araf,54,0.7351,0.045,0.793,0.162,say who ha forbidden the adornment of allah which he ha brought forth for his bondman and the good food say that is for the believer in this world and on the day of resurrection it will be for them only this is how we explain our verse in detail for people of knowledge
Al-Araf,51,-0.802,0.194,0.728,0.078,say my lord ha forbidden the indecency the apparent among them and the hidden and sin and wrongful excess and forbidden that you ascribe partner with allah for which he ha not sent down any proof and forbidden that you say thing concerning allah of which you do not have knowledge
Al-Araf,19,0.7644,0.0,0.636,0.364,and every group ha promise so when it promise come it cannot be postponed for moment or brought forward
Al-Araf,31,-0.0557,0.144,0.718,0.138,descendant of adam if noble messenger from among you come to you narrating my verse so whoever practice piety and reform upon him shall be no fear nor shall he grieve
Al-Araf,23,-0.872,0.331,0.669,0.0,and those who denied our sign and were conceited towards them are the people of hell fire they will remain in it forever
Al-Araf,62,-0.7574,0.127,0.825,0.048,so who is more unjust than one who fabricated lie against allah or denied his sign their written fate will reach them until when our sent angel come to remove their soul hence they say to them where are they whom you used to worship besides allah they say we have lost them and they testify against themselves that they were disbeliever
Al-Araf,70,-0.7391,0.119,0.86,0.021,allah say to them join the group of jinns and mankind who have entered hell before you when group enters it curse the other until when they have all gone in the latter group will say regarding the former our lord it is these who led u astray so give them double the punishment of the fire he will say for each one is double but you do not know
Al-Araf,26,-0.3612,0.178,0.726,0.096,and the preceding group will say to the latter so you too were no better than u therefore taste the punishment for what you have done
Al-Araf,50,0.7357,0.093,0.73,0.177,indeed those who denied our sign and were conceited towards them the gate of the heaven will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until the camel go through the needle eye and this is the sort of reward we give the guilty which will never happen
Al-Araf,19,-0.3167,0.227,0.637,0.136,their bed and their covering both are fire and this is the sort of reward we give the unjust
Al-Araf,34,0.9247,0.0,0.668,0.332,and those who accepted faith and performed good deed according to their capacity we do not burden any one except within it capacity are the people of paradise they shall abide in it forever
Al-Araf,72,0.9371,0.035,0.757,0.208,and we have removed resentment from their heart river will flow beneath them and while entering paradise they will say all praise is to allah who guided u to this we would not have attained the right path if allah had not guided u indeed the noble messenger of our lord brought the truth and it is proclaimed you have received this paradise a an inheritance for what you used to do
Al-Araf,50,0.802,0.161,0.549,0.29,and the people of paradise said to the people of hell we have surely received what our lord had truly promised u so have you also received what your lord had truly promised they said yes and an announcer between them proclaimed the curse of allah is upon the unjust
Al-Araf,19,-0.1779,0.193,0.644,0.163,those who prevent from the path of allah and wish to distort it and who disbelieve in the hereafter
Al-Araf,44,0.91,0.077,0.653,0.27,between paradise and hell is veil and on the height will be some men who will recognise them all by their forehead and they call to the people of paradise peace be upon you they have not entered paradise and they yearn for it
Al-Araf,23,-0.836,0.283,0.717,0.0,and when their eye turn towards the people of hell they will say our lord do not put u along with the unjust
Al-Araf,33,0.4588,0.0,0.914,0.086,and the men on the height will call to some men whom they recognise by their forehead and say what benefit did your derive from your populace and from what you prided in
Al-Araf,37,0.4055,0.157,0.649,0.193,are these the people muslim regarding whom you swore that allah would not have mercy on them at all whereas to the muslim it ha been said enter paradise you shall have no fear nor any grief
Al-Araf,39,0.128,0.196,0.579,0.224,and the people of hell will cry out to the people of paradise provide u some benefit from your water or from the food allah ha provided you they will say indeed allah ha forbidden both to the disbeliever
Al-Araf,40,-0.886,0.262,0.738,0.0,people who made their religion sport and pastime and whom the worldly life deceived so this day we will disregard them the way they had neglected their confronting of this day and the way they used to deny our sign
Al-Araf,23,0.765,0.0,0.761,0.239,and indeed we brought to them book which we have explained in detail with great knowledge guidance and mercy for people who believe
Al-Araf,89,-0.3182,0.083,0.848,0.069,what do they await except for the result foretold by that book to appear the day when the result foretold by it occurs those who had previously forgotten it from the beginning the disbeliever will exclaim indeed the noble messenger of our lord had brought the truth do we have any intercessor who may intercede for u or can we be returned to earth so we may do contrary to what we have done before indeed they have put themselves into ruin and have lost the thing they fabricated
Al-Araf,73,0.8591,0.017,0.834,0.148,indeed your lord is allah who created the heaven and the earth in six day then in the manner befitting his majesty ascended the throne of control he cover the night with the day which hastily follows it and made the sun and the moon and the star subservient to his command pay heed only he ha the power to create and command most auspicious propitious is allah the lord of the creation
Al-Araf,15,-0.6331,0.311,0.578,0.111,pray to your lord cry humbly and softly indeed he doe not love the transgressor
Al-Araf,27,0.8406,0.086,0.561,0.353,and do not spread turmoil in the earth after it reform and pray to him with fear and hope indeed allah mercy is close to the virtuous
Al-Araf,59,0.7184,0.062,0.776,0.162,and it is he who sends the wind giving glad tidings ahead of his mercy until when they come bearing heavy cloud we drove it towards city devoid of vegetation and then rained water upon it then produced fruit of various kind from it this is how we will bring forth the dead so that you may heed advice
Al-Araf,41,0.6682,0.045,0.813,0.141,and from the good land come forth it vegetation by the command of allah and from the infertile land nothing come forth except little with difficulty this is how we explain our sign in different way for people who are thankful
Al-Araf,34,-0.2297,0.189,0.666,0.145,indeed we sent nooh to his people he therefore said my people worship allah you do not have any god except him indeed fear for you the punishment of the great day of resurrection
Al-Araf,13,-0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,the leader of his people said indeed we see you in open error
Al-Araf,21,0.4404,0.087,0.711,0.202,he said my people there is no straying in me am in fact noble messenger from the lord of the creation
Al-Araf,22,0.5859,0.0,0.806,0.194,conveying to you the message of my lord and wishing good for you and know from allah what you do not know
Al-Araf,36,-0.0516,0.112,0.78,0.107,and are you surprised that an advice came to you from your lord through man amongst you so that he may warn you and that you may fear and so that there be mercy upon you
Al-Araf,29,-0.8527,0.314,0.608,0.078,in response they denied him so we rescued him and those with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our sign indeed they were blind group
Al-Araf,32,0.4614,0.051,0.814,0.135,and we sent hud to the people of aad from their own community he said my people worship allah you do not have any god except him so do you not fear
Al-Araf,17,-0.6597,0.265,0.735,0.0,the disbelieving leader of his people said indeed we consider you foolish and think you are liar
Al-Araf,23,0.3182,0.1,0.717,0.183,he said my people do not have any concern with foolishness and am in fact noble messenger from the lord of the creation
Al-Araf,14,0.6908,0.0,0.678,0.322,convey to you the message of my lord and am your trustworthy well wisher
Al-Araf,47,0.802,0.026,0.792,0.181,and are you surprised that an advice came to you from your lord through man amongst you so that he may warn you remember when he made you the successor of nooh people and enlarged your body therefore remember allah favour so that you may attain good
Al-Araf,33,0.8074,0.074,0.639,0.286,they said have you come to u in order that we worship only allah and abandon those whom our ancestor worshipped so bring upon u what you promise u if you are truthful
Al-Araf,45,-0.6808,0.161,0.766,0.073,he said indeed the punishment and the wrath of your lord have fallen upon you what you needlessly dispute with me regarding the name you and your ancestor have fabricated allah ha not sent down any proof concerning them therefore wait too await with you
Al-Araf,30,0.6597,0.13,0.625,0.245,we therefore rescued him and those with him by great mercy from u and we cut off the lineage of those who denied our sign and they were not believer
Al-Araf,68,-0.4882,0.166,0.705,0.129,and we sent saleh to the tribe of thamud from their own community he said my people worship allah you do not have any god except him indeed clear proof ha come to you from your lord this is allah she camel sign for you so leave her free to feed in allah earth and do not touch her with evil intention for painful punishment will seize you
Al-Araf,42,0.3182,0.054,0.842,0.104,and remember when he made you successor of ad and gave you region in the earth so you now build palace in the soft plain and carve house in rock therefore remember allah favour and do not roam the earth spreading turmoil
Al-Araf,36,0.7076,0.066,0.733,0.201,the proud leader of his people mockingly said to the weak muslim do you know that saleh is really the noble messenger of his lord they said we believe in whatever he ha been sent with
Al-Araf,11,0.1779,0.166,0.621,0.214,the proud one said we deny what you have believed in
Al-Araf,29,0.5106,0.064,0.767,0.169,so they hamstrung the she camel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said saleh bring upon u what you promise u if you are noble messenger
Al-Araf,15,-0.5267,0.195,0.805,0.0,therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their home
Al-Araf,44,-0.1541,0.076,0.882,0.042,saleh therefore turned away from them and said my people indeed did deliver my lord message to you and wished you good but you do not want well wishers the people in the graf can hear the speech of those who are on earth
Al-Araf,27,0.0772,0.158,0.645,0.196,and we sent lut when he said to his people what you commit the shameful act which no one in the creation ha ever done before you
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you lustfully go towards men instead of woman in fact you have transgressed the limit
Al-Araf,21,0.1531,0.092,0.75,0.158,and his people had no answer except to say turn them out of your dwelling these are people who wish purity
Al-Araf,17,0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149,and we rescued him and his family except his wife she became of those who stayed behind
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we rained shower of stone upon them therefore see what sort of fate befell the culprit
Al-Araf,68,0.9061,0.023,0.783,0.194,and we sent shuaib to madyan from their community he said my people worship allah you do not have any god except him indeed clear proof ha come to you from your lord so measure and weigh in full and do not give the people their good diminished and do not spread turmoil in the earth after it is organised this is for your good if you believe
Al-Araf,50,-0.2732,0.098,0.787,0.114,and do not be seated on every road in order to scare the traveller and to prevent from allah path the people who believe in him wishing to distort it and remember when you were few and he increased your number and see what sort of fate befell the mischievous
Al-Araf,33,0.6369,0.0,0.881,0.119,and if group among you belief in what have been sent with and another group doe not believe then wait until allah judge between u and allah judgement is the best of all
Al-Araf,38,0.0,0.097,0.829,0.073,the proud leader of his people said shuaib we swear we will banish you and the muslim who are with you from our town or you must return to our religion he said even though we detest it
Al-Araf,73,0.9423,0.0,0.803,0.197,we shall then have fabricated lie against allah if we return to your religion after allah ha rescued u from it and it is not for any of u muslim to return to your religion except if allah who is our lord will the knowledge of our lord encompasses all thing in allah only we have trusted our lord decide with justice between u and our people and yours is the best decision
Al-Araf,18,-0.3182,0.119,0.881,0.0,and the disbelieving leader of his people said if you obey shuaib you will indeed be in loss
Al-Araf,15,-0.5267,0.195,0.805,0.0,therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their home
Al-Araf,19,-0.836,0.372,0.628,0.0,a if those who denied shoaib had never lived in those home those who denied shoaib were themselves ruined
Al-Araf,44,-0.4336,0.062,0.938,0.0,so shoaib turned away from them saying my people indeed did deliver my lord message to you and gave you sound advice so why should grieve for the disbeliever the people in the graf can hear the speech of those who are on earth
Al-Araf,24,-0.765,0.232,0.732,0.037,and never did we send any prophet to dwelling but we seized it people with hardship and adversity so that they may become humble
Al-Araf,32,-0.5574,0.164,0.741,0.095,then we changed the misfortune into prosperity to the extent that they became numerous and said indeed grief and comfort did reach our ancestor so we seized them suddenly in their neglect
Al-Araf,42,-0.1901,0.082,0.809,0.109,and had the people of the dwelling believed and been pious we would have surely opened for them the blessing from the sky and from the earth but in fact they denied and we therefore seized them on account of their deed
Al-Araf,21,0.4075,0.0,0.836,0.164,do the people of the dwelling not fear that our wrath may come upon them at night while they are asleep
Al-Araf,23,0.5466,0.0,0.783,0.217,or do the people of the dwelling not fear that our wrath may come upon them during the day while they are playing
Al-Araf,20,-0.5859,0.167,0.833,0.0,are they oblivious to allah secret plan so none is unafraid of allah secret plan except the people of ruin
Al-Araf,39,-0.5574,0.087,0.913,0.0,or did not those who inherited the land after it owner get enough guidance that if we will we can afflict them with calamity for their sin and we set seal upon their heart so they do not hear
Al-Araf,56,0.9062,0.043,0.72,0.238,these are the dwelling the affair of which we relate to you prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him and indeed their respective noble messenger came to them with clear proof so they were not able to believe in what they had denied before this is how allah set seal upon the heart of disbeliever
Al-Araf,19,-0.3252,0.115,0.885,0.0,and we found most of them not true to their word and indeed we found most of them disobedient
Al-Araf,31,-0.7227,0.144,0.856,0.0,then after them we sent moosa with our sign to firaun and his court member but they did injustice to those sign therefore see what sort of fate befell the mischievous
Al-Araf,14,0.6249,0.0,0.702,0.298,and moosa said firaun indeed am noble messenger from the lord of the creation
Al-Araf,33,0.5994,0.0,0.864,0.136,it is obligatory for me not to speak concerning allah except the truth have come to you all with clear sign from your lord therefore let the descendant of israel go with me
Al-Araf,15,0.4588,0.0,0.824,0.176,said firaun if you have come with sign then present it if you are truthful
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore moosa put down his staff it immediately turned into visible python
Al-Araf,16,0.7152,0.0,0.701,0.299,and putting his hand in his bosom withdrew it so it shone brightly before the beholder
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said the chieftain of firaun people he is really an expert magician
Al-Araf,14,-0.0516,0.165,0.682,0.153,he wish to expel you all from your kingdom so what do you advise
Al-Araf,16,-0.296,0.128,0.872,0.0,they said stop him and his brother and send announcer to the city to gather people
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to bring all the expert magician to you
Al-Araf,17,0.5719,0.0,0.812,0.188,and the magician came to firaun and said will we get some reward if we are victorious
Al-Araf,11,0.4019,0.0,0.787,0.213,he said yes and you will then become close to me
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moosa you may throw first or shall we be the first to throw
Al-Araf,23,0.0258,0.137,0.722,0.141,he said you throw when they threw they cast magic spell upon the people eye and terrified them and they brought great magic
Al-Araf,16,0.4939,0.0,0.824,0.176,and we inspired moosa that put forth your staff it immediately began swallowing up their fabrication
Al-Araf,10,0.3774,0.0,0.777,0.223,so the truth wa proved and their work were disproved
Al-Araf,10,-0.6705,0.407,0.593,0.0,they were therefore defeated here and they turned back humiliated
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician were obliged to fall prostrate
Al-Araf,12,0.7184,0.0,0.562,0.438,they said we have accepted faith in the lord of the creation
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moosa and haroon
Al-Araf,38,0.1531,0.133,0.699,0.167,said firaun you have accepted faith in him before gave you permission this is indeed grand conspiracy you have plotted in the city in order to expel it people from it so now you will come to know
Al-Araf,17,0.2263,0.161,0.683,0.156,swear will cut off your hand and your foot from alternate side and then crucify you all
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we shall return to our lord
Al-Araf,36,-0.7579,0.183,0.817,0.0,and what did you dislike in u except that we believed in the sign of our lord when they came to u our lord pour bestow abundantly patience on u and bestow u death a muslim
Al-Araf,48,-0.6597,0.105,0.895,0.0,the chieftain of firaun people said are you releasing moosa and his people to cause turmoil in the land and for moosa to abandon you and your appointed deity he said we shall now slay their son and spare their woman and indeed we have power over them
Al-Araf,37,0.7717,0.0,0.811,0.189,moosa said to his people seek the help of allah and patiently endure indeed the owner of the earth is allah he appoints a it successor whomever he will and the final triumph is for the pious
Al-Araf,48,-0.8779,0.19,0.81,0.0,they said we have been oppressed before you came to u and after you have come to u he said it is likely that your lord may destroy your enemy and in his place make you the ruler of the earth and then see what deed you perform
Al-Araf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed we seized the people of firaun with famine of several year and with reduction of fruit so that they may follow advice
Al-Araf,47,-0.217,0.142,0.732,0.125,so when good would reach them they would say this is for u and when misfortune reached them they would infer it a ill omen of moosa and his companion pay heed the misfortune of their ill luck lie with allah but most of them are unaware
Al-Araf,29,-0.296,0.078,0.922,0.0,and said you may come with any sign to u in order to cast magic spell on u yet by no mean are we going to believe in you
Al-Araf,32,0.0772,0.078,0.836,0.086,we therefore sent against them the flood and the locust and the vermin or insect and the frog and the blood separate sign in response they were proud and were guilty people
Al-Araf,48,0.4939,0.112,0.702,0.186,and whenever the punishment came upon them they said moosa pray to your lord for u by mean of his covenant which you have indeed if you lift the punishment from u we will surely accept faith in you and let the descendant of israel go with you
Al-Araf,20,-0.4767,0.143,0.807,0.049,consequently whenever we lifted the punishment from them for term which they must reach they used to then turn away
Al-Araf,24,-0.9132,0.388,0.612,0.0,we therefore took revenge from them so we drowned them in the sea for they used to deny our sign and were ignoring them
Al-Araf,57,0.8225,0.088,0.702,0.209,and we made the people who were oppressed the inheritor of the eastern and western part of the land in which we placed blessing and the good promise of your lord wa fulfilled for the descendant of israel the reward of their patience and we destroyed whatever firaun and his people built and whatever they had contrived
Al-Araf,48,0.2732,0.042,0.875,0.083,and we transported the descendant of israel across the sea so they came across people who used to squat in seclusion in front of their idol they said moosa make god for u the way they have so many god he said you are indeed an ignorant people
Al-Araf,19,-0.5719,0.171,0.829,0.0,the condition they are in is in fact one of destruction and all what they do is utter falsehood
Al-Araf,26,0.7096,0.0,0.769,0.231,he said shall seek for you god other than allah whereas he ha given you superiority above the entire world by sending his message towards you
Al-Araf,32,0.7845,0.071,0.688,0.241,and remember when we rescued you from firaun people who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaughtering your son and sparing your daughter and in it wa great favour from your lord
Al-Araf,58,0.1114,0.028,0.937,0.035,and we agreed with moosa covenant for thirty night of solitude and completed it by adding ten to them so the covenant of his lord amounted to forty night in full and moosa said to his brother haroon be my deputy over my people and make reform and do not allow the way of the mischievous to enter
Al-Araf,92,0.1655,0.0,0.982,0.018,and when moosa presented himself upon our promise and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show me your self so that may see you he said you will never be able to see me but look towards the mountain if it stay in it place then you shall soon see me so when his lord directed his light on the mountain he blew it into bit and moosa fell down unconscious then upon regaining consciousness he said purity is to you incline towards you and am the first muslim
Al-Araf,28,0.7944,0.0,0.786,0.214,said allah moosa have chosen you from mankind by bestowing my message and by my speech so accept what have bestowed upon you and be among the thankful
Al-Araf,43,0.6705,0.0,0.882,0.118,and we wrote for him on the tablet the advice for all thing and the detail of all thing and commanded accept it firmly and command your people to choose it good advice soon shall show you people the destination of the disobedient
Al-Araf,71,-0.3182,0.103,0.822,0.075,and shall turn away from my sign the people who unjustly wish to be admired in the earth and if they see all the sign they would not believe them and if they see the path of guidance they would not prefer to tread it and if they see the way of error they would present themselves to tread it that is because they denied our sign and were ignoring them
Al-Araf,28,-0.7717,0.235,0.765,0.0,and those who denied our sign and the confronting of the hereafter all their deed are wasted what recompense will they get except what they used to do
Al-Araf,40,0.1027,0.073,0.822,0.104,and behind moosa his people moulded calf from their ornament lifeless body making sound like cow did they not see that it neither speaks to them nor guide them in any way they chose it for worship and were unjust
Al-Araf,28,-0.4784,0.172,0.759,0.069,and when they repented and realised that they had gone astray they said if our lord doe not have mercy on u and forgive u we are ruined
Al-Araf,89,-0.9387,0.194,0.747,0.059,and when moosa returned to his people angry and upset he said what an evil way you have handled affair on my behalf behind me did you hasten upon the command of your lord and he cast down the stone tablet and catching hold of his brother hair began pulling him towards him said haroon said the son of my mother the people thought wa weak and would have probably killed me so do not make my enemy laugh at me and do not identify me with the unjust
Al-Araf,27,0.7845,0.0,0.712,0.288,he submitted my lord forgive me and my brother and admit u into your mercy and you are the most merciful of all those who show mercy
Al-Araf,33,-0.4767,0.17,0.713,0.118,indeed those who took the calf the punishment from their lord and humiliation will reach them in the life of this world and this is the way we reward those who fabricate lie
Al-Araf,21,0.7783,0.0,0.698,0.302,and those who performed misdeed and then repented and accepted faith so after that your lord is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Araf,27,-0.6597,0.207,0.719,0.075,and when the anger of moosa abated he picked up the stone tablet and in their text are guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,87,0.9356,0.06,0.755,0.185,and moosa chose seventy men from his people for our promise therefore when the earthquake seized them he submitted my lord if you had willed you could have destroyed them and me even earlier will you destroy u for the deed which the ignorant among u did that is not but your testing u with it you send astray whomever you will and guide whomever you will you are our master so forgive u and have mercy on u and you are the best of the forgiving
Al-Araf,51,0.5106,0.126,0.695,0.179,and destine good for u in this world and in the hereafter we have indeed inclined towards you he said give my punishment to whomever will and my mercy encompasses all thing so shall soon destine favour for those who fear and pay the charity and they believe in our sign
Al-Araf,141,0.9821,0.048,0.734,0.218,those who will obey this noble messenger prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him the herald of the hidden who is untutored except by allah whom they will find mentioned in the taurat and the injeel with them he will command them to do good and forbid them from wrong and he will make lawful for them the good clean thing and prohibit the foul for them and he will unburden the load and the neck chain which were upon them so those who believe in him and revere him and help him and follow the light which came down with him it is they who have succeeded the holy prophet wa taught by allah himself see surah al rahman to honour the holy prophet peace and blessing be upon him is part of faith to disrespect him is blasphemy
Al-Araf,92,0.9679,0.07,0.674,0.257,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him people indeed am towards you all the noble messenger of allah for whom allah only is the kingship of the heaven and the earth there is none worthy of worship except him giving life and giving death therefore believe in allah and his noble messenger the prophet who is untutored except by allah who belief in allah and his word and obey him the prophet to attain guidance prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him is the prophet towards all mankind
Al-Araf,18,0.7351,0.0,0.721,0.279,and among the people of moosa is group that show the true path and establishes justice with it
Al-Araf,84,0.7011,0.014,0.904,0.082,and we divided them into twelve tribe a separate group and when his people asked him for water we revealed to moosa strike the rock with your staff so twelve spring gushed forth from it each group recognised it drinking place and we made the cloud canopy over them and sent down the manna and the salwa bird on them eat of the good thing we have provided you and they did not wrong u in the least but they used to wrong themselves
Al-Araf,41,0.4336,0.135,0.657,0.208,and remember when they were commanded reside in this township and eat whatever you wish in it and say sin are forgiven and enter the gate prostrating we will forgive you your sin we shall soon bestow more upon the virtuous
Al-Araf,30,-0.888,0.28,0.72,0.0,so the unjust among them changed the word contrary to what they had been commanded consequently we sent down upon them punishment from the sky the recompense of their injustice
Al-Araf,72,0.8555,0.0,0.867,0.133,and ask them dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him of the township that wa by the sea when they used to exceed in the matter of the sabbath when their fish used to come swimming atop the water in front of them on the day of sabbath and not come on the day it wa not sabbath this is how we used to test them due to their disobedience
Al-Araf,38,-0.9042,0.267,0.705,0.028,and when group among them said why do you preach to people whom allah is going to destroy or mete out severe punishment they said to have an excuse before your lord and that perhaps they may fear
Al-Araf,28,-0.9001,0.348,0.581,0.071,and when they forgot the advice they had been given we rescued those who forbade evil and seized the unjust with dreadful punishment the recompense of their disobedience
Al-Araf,16,-0.5719,0.251,0.749,0.0,consequently when they rebelled against the command to refrain we said to them be ape despised
Al-Araf,45,-0.4939,0.168,0.704,0.128,and remember when your lord announced the command that till the day of resurrection will certainly send such oppressor against them who will inflict them with dreadful punishment indeed your lord is swift in meting out punishment and indeed he is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Araf,37,-0.34,0.16,0.711,0.129,and we divided them in the earth a separate group some of them are righteous and some are the other type and we tested them with good favour and evil thing adversity so that they may return
Al-Araf,86,0.9313,0.048,0.746,0.206,and after them in their place came those unworthy successor who inherited the book they accept the good of this world a bribe and say we shall soon be forgiven and if similar good come to them again they would accept it wa not the covenant taken from them in the book that they must not relate anything to allah except the truth and they have studied it and indeed the abode of the hereafter is better for the pious so do you not have sense
Al-Araf,24,0.3252,0.0,0.908,0.092,and those who hold fast to the book and have kept the prayer established and we do not waste the wage of the righteous
Al-Araf,42,0.3818,0.0,0.939,0.061,and when we raised the mount sinai above them a if it were canopy and they thought that it would fall upon them accept firmly what we have given you and remember what is in it so that you may become pious
Al-Araf,53,0.5859,0.031,0.871,0.098,and remember when your lord brought forth the generation from the back of the descendant of adam and made them their own witness am not your lord they all said yes surely you are why not we testify for you may say on the day of resurrection that we were unaware of this
Al-Araf,36,-0.5809,0.1,0.9,0.0,or you may say it is our ancestor who first ascribed partner to allah and we were their child after them so will you destroy u on account of the deed of the follower of falsehood
Al-Araf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and this is how we explain the verse in different way and so that they may return
Al-Araf,43,0.8519,0.0,0.811,0.189,and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him recite to them the case of the one to whom we gave our revelation and in response he departed from them completely so satan went after him he therefore became of the astray
Al-Araf,70,-0.3612,0.115,0.801,0.084,and had we willed we could have raised him because of the revelation but he clung to the earth and followed his own desire his condition therefore is like that of dog if you attack him he hang out his tongue and if you leave him he hang out his tongue this is the state of the people who denied our sign therefore preach so that they may give thought
Al-Araf,19,-0.886,0.394,0.606,0.0,what an evil example is of those who denied our sign and used to wrong only their own soul
Al-Araf,22,-0.5267,0.139,0.861,0.0,whomever allah guide only he is on the right path and whomever he sends astray it is they who are the loser
Al-Araf,51,-0.743,0.163,0.763,0.075,and indeed we have created many jinns and men for hell they have heart in which their is no understanding and the eye they do not see with and the ear they do not hear with they are like cattle in fact more astray it is they who are the neglectful
Al-Araf,33,0.8074,0.069,0.689,0.242,and for allah only are the best name so invoke him by them and abandon those who depart from the truth regarding his name they will soon receive the reward of their deed
Al-Araf,15,0.7783,0.0,0.606,0.394,and from our creation is group that show the truth and establishes justice with it
Al-Araf,22,-0.7269,0.234,0.766,0.0,and those who denied our sign we shall soon steadily lead them towards the punishment from the place they will not know
Al-Araf,12,0.2247,0.0,0.853,0.147,and will give them respite indeed my secret plan is extremely solid
Al-Araf,20,-0.5267,0.236,0.659,0.105,do they not ponder that their companion is far removed from insanity in fact he is clearly herald of warning
Al-Araf,48,0.4019,0.07,0.793,0.137,have they not pondered deeply regarding the kingdom of the heaven and the earth and whatever thing allah created and that possibly their promise of death may have come near so after this in what will they believe advent of the last prophet and the holy qur an
Al-Araf,21,-0.128,0.07,0.93,0.0,for one whom allah sends astray there is none to guide him and he leaf them to wander in their rebellion
Al-Araf,70,0.2846,0.0,0.969,0.031,they ask you about the resurrection a to when it is destined say indeed it knowledge is with my lord only he will manifest it at it time it is proving cumbersome in the heaven and the earth it will not come to you except suddenly they question you a if you have researched it deeply say indeed it knowledge is with allah only but most people do not know
Al-Araf,52,-0.144,0.163,0.699,0.138,say have no autonomy to benefit or hurt myself except what allah will and were to procure knowledge of the hidden on my own it would be that had accumulated lot of good and no misfortune would touch me am purely herald of warning and glad tidings to the people who believe
Al-Araf,72,0.8387,0.095,0.706,0.199,it is he who created you from single soul and from him made it mate for him to gain comfort with her so when the male covered her she wa burdened lightly in her womb and she therefore moved easily carrying it and when she felt the burden heavy they both cried to their lord allah indeed you may give to u child a you will so we will surely be thankful
Al-Araf,32,0.7717,0.0,0.812,0.188,so when he bestowed them normal child they ascribed partner to him in respect of what he had bestowed upon them therefore supreme is allah above all that they ascribe a partner
Al-Araf,17,0.2716,0.074,0.793,0.132,do they the disbeliever ascribe false deity that which do not create anything but are themselves created
Al-Araf,12,-0.5448,0.311,0.689,0.0,and cannot provide any help to them nor do they help themselves
Al-Araf,26,0.1531,0.0,0.94,0.06,and if you call the disbeliever to guidance they do not follow you it is the same for you whether you invite them or remain silent
Al-Araf,25,0.7717,0.0,0.741,0.259,indeed those whom you the disbeliever worship besides allah are slave like you so call them and they may answer you if you are truthful
Al-Araf,44,0.4939,0.0,0.931,0.069,do they have foot to walk with or have they hand to hold with or have they eye to see with or have they ear to hear with say call upon your ascribed partner and conspire against me and do not give me respite
Al-Araf,16,0.34,0.0,0.862,0.138,indeed my protector is allah who ha sent down the book and he befriends the righteous
Al-Araf,15,-0.3217,0.241,0.641,0.118,and those whom you worship besides him cannot help you nor do they help themselves
Al-Araf,32,0.7717,0.0,0.817,0.183,and if you call them to guidance they do not listen and you prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him observe them looking towards you whereas they do not perceive anything
Al-Araf,21,0.9153,0.066,0.438,0.497,and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him adopt forgiveness and enjoin virtue and turn away from the ignorant
Al-Araf,19,-0.7717,0.283,0.717,0.0,and listener if the devil provokes you seek the refuge of allah indeed he is all hearing all knowing
Al-Araf,17,-0.8834,0.424,0.576,0.0,indeed those who fear get alerted whenever temptation from the devil trouble them and they perceive immediately
Al-Araf,17,-0.8713,0.414,0.586,0.0,and the devil pull those who their brother into error and then do not make any relaxation
Al-Araf,56,0.9403,0.0,0.765,0.235,and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him when you do not bring to them verse they say why did you not fabricate it say follow only what is divinely revealed to me from my lord this the holy qur an is an enlightenment from your lord and guidance and mercy for the muslim
Al-Araf,19,0.3612,0.0,0.878,0.122,and when the qur an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
Al-Araf,26,-0.7351,0.205,0.795,0.0,and remember your lord within your heart humbly and with fear and softly with your tongue morning and evening and do not be of the neglectful
Al-Araf,28,-0.2924,0.075,0.925,0.0,indeed those who are with your lord are not conceited towards worshipping him and they proclaim his purity and it is to him they prostrate command of prostration
Al-Anfal,48,0.8275,0.161,0.541,0.299,they ask you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him concerning the war booty say allah and the noble messenger are the owner of the war booty so fear allah and maintain friendship among yourselves and obey allah and his noble messenger if you have faith
Al-Anfal,30,0.4404,0.088,0.744,0.168,only they are the believer whose heart fear when allah is remembered and their faith advance when his verse are recited to them and who trust only in their lord
Al-Anfal,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those who keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
Al-Anfal,18,0.7906,0.0,0.652,0.348,these are the true muslim for them are rank before their lord and forgiveness and an honourable sustenance
Al-Anfal,26,0.2732,0.091,0.749,0.16,the way your lord caused you dear prophet to come forth from your home with the truth and indeed group of muslim were unhappy about it
Al-Anfal,21,-0.4019,0.24,0.582,0.178,disputing with you regarding the truth after it had been made clear a if they were being herded towards visible death
Al-Anfal,46,-0.7506,0.2,0.714,0.086,and remember when allah promised you that one of the two group of enemy is for you and you wished to get the one that posed no danger and allah willed to prove the truth with his word and to cut the origin of the disbeliever
Al-Anfal,17,-0.5719,0.269,0.628,0.103,in order that he may prove the truth and disprove falsehood even if the criminal get annoyed
Al-Anfal,32,0.9022,0.0,0.698,0.302,when you prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him were seeking the help of your lord so he answered your prayer that will help you with row of thousand of angel
Al-Anfal,28,0.936,0.0,0.601,0.399,and allah did this just for your happiness and for your heart to gain contentment and help doe not come except from allah indeed allah is almighty wise
Al-Anfal,50,0.5209,0.0,0.935,0.065,when he made the slumber overcome you so it wa a peacefulness from him and sent down water from the sky upon you to purify you with it and to remove the impurity of satan from you and to give your heart fortitude and firmly establish your foot with it
Al-Anfal,44,0.0538,0.103,0.791,0.107,and when dear prophet your lord wa inspiring the angel that am with you so make the believer stand firm will soon instil fear into the heart of the disbeliever so strike above the disbeliever neck and hit their each and every bone joint
Al-Anfal,24,0.0516,0.182,0.629,0.189,this is because they opposed allah and his noble messenger and whoever opposes allah and his noble messenger then indeed allah punishment is severe
Al-Anfal,17,-0.6808,0.272,0.728,0.0,therefore taste this for now and along with it for the disbeliever is the punishment of fire
Al-Anfal,19,-0.5106,0.202,0.798,0.0,people who believe when you confront large army of disbeliever in battle do not turn your back to them
Al-Anfal,38,-0.8402,0.236,0.671,0.093,and on that day whoever turn his back to them except for battle strategy or to join one own company ha then turned towards allah wrath and his destination is hell and what an evil place of return
Al-Anfal,57,0.9765,0.0,0.698,0.302,so you did not slay them but in fact allah slew them and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him you did not throw the sand when you did throw but in fact allah threw and in order to bestow an excellent reward upon the muslim indeed allah is the all hearing the all knowing
Al-Anfal,14,-0.4215,0.177,0.823,0.0,therefore take this and know that allah will weaken the scheme of the disbeliever
Al-Anfal,52,-0.4731,0.138,0.775,0.087,disbeliever if you seek judgement then this judgement ha come to you and if you desist it is better for you and if you return to mischief we will punish you again and your populace will not benefit you however large it may be and besides this allah is with the muslim
Al-Anfal,22,0.4588,0.0,0.875,0.125,people who believe obey allah and his noble messenger and do not turn away from him after you have heard him speak
Al-Anfal,16,-0.2755,0.123,0.877,0.0,and do not be like those who said we have heard whereas they do not hear
Al-Anfal,22,-0.8126,0.27,0.73,0.0,indeed the worst beast in the sight of allah are those people who are deaf dumb who do not have any sense
Al-Anfal,31,0.4588,0.0,0.909,0.091,and had allah found any goodness in them he would have made them hear and had he made them hear they would in the end have turned away and gone back
Al-Anfal,52,0.6808,0.027,0.848,0.125,people who believe present yourselves upon the command of allah and his noble messenger when the noble messenger call you towards the matter that will bestow you life and know that the command of allah becomes barrier between man and his heart intention and that you will all be raised towards him

Al-Anfal,44,0.836,0.06,0.713,0.227,and remember when you were only few and meek in the land and feared that men may snatch you away he therefore gave you refuge and strengthened you with his help and gave you good thing a sustenance so that you may be thankful
Al-Anfal,16,0.8647,0.0,0.573,0.427,people who believe do not betray allah and his noble messenger nor purposely defraud your trust
Al-Anfal,18,0.7845,0.0,0.699,0.301,and know that your wealth and your child are test and that with allah is an immense reward

At-Tawbah,34,0.8393,0.058,0.675,0.267,then allah sent down his calm upon his noble messenger and upon the muslim and sent down army you did not see and punished the disbeliever and such is the reward of the denier
At-Tawbah,17,0.4404,0.0,0.847,0.153,then afterwards allah will give repentance to whomever he will and allah is oft forgiving most merciful

Hud,60,-0.2206,0.117,0.779,0.104,and do not say to you have the treasure of allah nor that gain knowledge of the hidden nor do say that am an angel nor do say to those whom your sight consider lowly that allah will never give them any good allah well know what is in their heart if do so would then be of the unjust
Hud,25,0.128,0.171,0.641,0.189,they said nooh you have disputed with u and disputed in the extreme therefore bring upon u what you promise u if you are truthful
Hud,20,0.5574,0.0,0.796,0.204,he said allah will surely bring that upon you if he will and you will not be able to escape

Hud,41,0.2194,0.1,0.782,0.118,and my people seek forgiveness from your lord then incline towards him in repentance he will send abundant rain from the sky upon you and will give you much more strength than you have and do not turn away committing crime
Hud,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said hud you have not come to u with any proof and we will not forsake our deity upon your saying nor will we believe you
Hud,36,-0.7351,0.184,0.816,0.0,we only say that you have been severely struck by one of our deity he said make allah witness and you all bear witness that have no relation with whatever you ascribe a partner to allah

Hud,55,0.8062,0.035,0.782,0.183,and to the thamud tribe we sent their fellow man saleh he said my people worship allah there is no other true god except him he created you from the earth and established you in it so seek forgiveness from him and incline towards him in repentance indeed my lord is close acceptor of prayer
Hud,37,-0.2466,0.18,0.688,0.133,they said saleh you seemed very promising among u before this what you forbid u from worshipping the deity of our forefather and indeed we have fallen into deeply intriguing doubt concerning what you call u to
Hud,45,0.7784,0.078,0.718,0.204,he said my people what is your opinion if am on clear proof from my lord and he ha bestowed upon me mercy from him so who will rescue me from allah if disobey him so you will not increase anything for me except loss
Hud,36,-0.8176,0.182,0.791,0.026,and my people this is the she camel of allah sign for you so let her graze in allah earth and do not touch her with an evil intention for an imminent punishment will reach you

Hud,33,0.6597,0.078,0.711,0.211,therefore when our command came we rescued saleh and the muslim who were with him by our mercy and from the disgrace of that day indeed your lord is the strong the almighty
Hud,17,-0.91,0.49,0.51,0.0,and the terrible scream seized the unjust so at morning they remained lying flattened in their home
Hud,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a if they had never lived there indeed the tribe of thamud disbelieved in their lord away with the thamud
Hud,22,0.8993,0.0,0.601,0.399,and indeed our angel came to ibrahim with glad tidings they said peace he answered peace and without delay brought roasted calf
Hud,34,-0.1759,0.133,0.752,0.115,and when he saw their hand not reaching towards it he thought they were pretending and inwardly started fearing them they said do not be afraid we are sent to the people of lut
Hud,40,0.7184,0.066,0.744,0.19,and his wife wa standing by and she started laughing so we gave her glad tidings regarding ishaq and following ishaq regarding yaqub she wa glad that the disbelieving people of lut would be destroyed the birth of these two
Hud,27,-0.4215,0.097,0.903,0.0,she said oh woe to me will bear child whereas am an old woman and this my husband is an old man this is something really extraordinary

Hud,20,-0.3182,0.227,0.598,0.175,and when ibrahim fear abated and the glad tidings reached him he argued with u regarding the people of lut
Hud,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed ibrahim is most forbearing very soft hearted penitent
Hud,23,-0.1476,0.119,0.746,0.135,ibrahim turn away from this indeed your lord command ha come and indeed punishment will come upon them which will not be averted
Hud,26,-0.4939,0.241,0.64,0.119,and when our angel came to lut he wa distressed for them and wa disheartened due to them and said this is day of great hardship
Hud,62,-0.688,0.109,0.834,0.056,and his people came running towards him and they were in the habit of committing evil deed he said my people these woman of the tribe are my daughter they are purer for you therefore fear allah and do not disgrace me in the midst of my guest is there not even single righteous man among you the wife of those people
Hud,22,0.128,0.088,0.803,0.108,they said you know that we have no right to the daughter of your tribe and you obviously know what we desire
Hud,20,0.8481,0.0,0.649,0.351,he said if only had the strength against you or were able to get the refuge of some strong support
Hud,71,-0.0516,0.034,0.934,0.032,the angel said lut we are the sent one of your lord they cannot get to you therefore during the night take your entire household with you and not one of you may turn around and see except your wife she too will be afflicted with the same a they will be indeed their promise is at morn is not the morning imminent she wa disbeliever and sided with the culprit
Hud,20,-0.5574,0.159,0.841,0.0,so when our command came we turned that township upside down and showered it continuously with stone of fired clay
Hud,19,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,that are marked in the custody your lord and those stone are not at all far from the unjust
Hud,46,0.1531,0.149,0.675,0.176,and to madyan their fellow man shuaib he said my people worship allah there is no other true god except him and do not make reduction in measure and weight indeed see you prosperous and fear the punishment of the besieging day of resurrection upon you
Hud,28,0.5859,0.074,0.74,0.186,my people measure and weigh in full with justice and do not give the people their good diminished and do not roam about in the earth causing turmoil
Hud,21,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,that which remains from allah bestowal is better for you if you believe and am not at all guardian over you
Hud,44,0.0699,0.133,0.749,0.118,they said shuaib doe your prayer command you that we forsake the deity of our forefather or that we may not do a we wish with our own property yes indeed only you are very intelligent most righteous they mocked at him with sarcasm
Hud,70,0.6948,0.087,0.754,0.158,he said my people what is your opinion if am on clear proof from my lord and he ha bestowed me with an excellent sustenance from him shall ignore all this and the matter forbid you to do do not wish that myself act against it only intend to make improvement a far possible my guidance is only from allah rely only upon him and towards him only do incline
Hud,47,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and my people may not your opposition to me occasion the coming upon you of the thing similar to what befell the people of nooh or the people of hud or the people of saleh and the people of lut are not at all far from you
Hud,20,0.6764,0.0,0.764,0.236,ask forgiveness from your lord and then incline towards him in repentance indeed my lord is most merciful most affectionate
Hud,41,-0.25,0.113,0.819,0.069,they said shuaib we do not understand most of what you say and indeed we perceive you weak among u were it not for your relative we would have stoned you and in our sight you have no respect at all
Hud,37,-0.0772,0.056,0.895,0.049,he said my people is the pressure upon you from my relative worth more than allah and you put him behind your back indeed whatever you do is all within my lord control his command my preaching
Hud,42,-0.8658,0.199,0.801,0.0,and my people keep on with your work in your position am doing mine very soon you will come to know upon whom come the punishment that will disgrace him and who is the liar and wait too am waiting with you
Hud,35,-0.802,0.267,0.62,0.113,and when our command came we rescued shuaib and the muslim who were with him by our mercy and the terrible scream seized the unjust so at morning they remained lying flattened in their home
Hud,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a if they had never lived there away with the madyan just a the thamud were removed afar
Hud,11,0.34,0.094,0.703,0.203,and indeed we sent moosa with our revelation and clear domination
Hud,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,towards firaun and his court member thereupon they followed the command of firaun and the work of firaun wa not proper
Hud,22,-0.6808,0.18,0.82,0.0,he will lead his people on the day of resurrection therefore landing them into hell and what wretched place to land into
Hud,20,-0.1531,0.143,0.738,0.119,and curse followed them in the world and on the day of resurrection what wretched gift is what they received
Hud,31,0.802,0.055,0.703,0.242,these are the tidings of the township which we relate to you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him some of them still stand and some are cut off
Hud,45,0.6945,0.12,0.679,0.201,and we did not oppress them at all but it is they who wronged themselves therefore their deity whom they worshipped other than allah did not in the least benefit them when your lord command came and due to them they increased nothing but ruin
Hud,22,-0.8481,0.326,0.674,0.0,and similar is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the township upon their injustice indeed his seizure is painful severe
Hud,31,-0.7506,0.181,0.819,0.0,indeed in this is sign for one who fear the punishment of the hereafter this is the day on which everyone will be gathered and this is the day of attendance
Hud,10,0.1695,0.0,0.844,0.156,and we do not postpone it except for fixed term
Hud,21,-0.2732,0.193,0.695,0.112,when that day come no one will speak without his permission so among them are the ill fated and the fortunate
Hud,17,-0.4019,0.24,0.645,0.115,so those who are ill fated are in the fire they will bray like donkey in it
Hud,39,0.5267,0.077,0.766,0.158,remaining in it a long a the heaven and the earth remain except a much a your lord willed indeed your lord may do whatever whenever he will remaining forever even after the heaven and the earth are destroyed
Hud,32,0.9231,0.0,0.643,0.357,so those who are fortunate are in paradise abiding in it a long a the heaven and the earth remain except a much a your lord willed this is the everlasting favour
Hud,36,0.8321,0.034,0.721,0.245,so listener follower of this prophet do not fall into doubt by what these disbeliever worship they only worship just a their forefather worshipped before and indeed we shall pay them their due in full undiminished
Hud,46,-0.6249,0.105,0.872,0.022,and indeed we gave moosa the book hence there wa discord regarding it and were it not for word that had been previously passed from your lord the matter would have immediately been decided regarding them and indeed they are in an intriguing doubt concerning it
Hud,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed to each and every one your lord will fully repay his deed he is informed of their deed
Hud,28,0.1139,0.0,0.949,0.051,therefore remain firm the way you are commanded to and those who have turned along with you and people do not rebel indeed he is seeing your deed
Hud,29,-0.7589,0.224,0.776,0.0,and do not incline towards the unjust for the fire will touch you and you do not have any supporter other than allah then you will not be helped
Hud,36,-0.3612,0.107,0.823,0.07,and keep the prayer established at the two end of the day and in some part of the night indeed good deed wipe out the evil deed this is an advice to those who heed it
Hud,13,0.3252,0.0,0.837,0.163,and have patience for allah doe not waste the wage of the righteous
Hud,54,-0.4019,0.135,0.756,0.109,so why were not there some people from the generation before you who had some goodness remaining in them in order to prevent others from causing turmoil in the earth except few among them the very one whom we had rescued and the unjust remained pursuing what they were given and they were guilty
Hud,17,0.431,0.0,0.84,0.16,and your lord is not such a to destroy township without reason while their people are righteous
Hud,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and had your lord willed he would have made mankind one nation and they will always keep differing
Hud,35,0.4939,0.104,0.676,0.221,except those upon whom your lord had mercy and this is why he created them and the word of your lord ha been concluded that indeed will surely fill hell with jinns and men combined
Hud,35,0.7717,0.0,0.806,0.194,and we relate to you all the account of noble messenger in order to steady your heart with it and in this the truth ha come to you and for the muslim preaching and advice
Hud,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and say to the disbeliever keep on with your work in your place we are carrying out ours
Hud,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and wait we too are waiting
Hud,40,0.8588,0.0,0.753,0.247,and for allah only are the hidden of the heaven and of the earth and towards him only is the return of all matter therefore worship him and trust him and your lord is not unaware of what you do
Yusuf,25,0.3818,0.0,0.902,0.098,alif lam ra these are verse of the clear book alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
Yusuf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we have sent down an arabic qur an so that you may perceive
Yusuf,27,0.872,0.051,0.648,0.301,we relate to you the best narrative because we have sent the divine revelation of this qur an to you although surely you were unaware before this
Yusuf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,remember when yusuf joseph said to his father my father saw eleven star and the sun and the moon saw them prostrating to me
Yusuf,27,-0.6416,0.173,0.827,0.0,he said my child do not relate your dream to your brother for they will hatch plot against you indeed satan is an open enemy towards mankind
Yusuf,48,0.9246,0.0,0.767,0.233,and this is how your lord will choose you and teach you how to interpret event and will perfect his favour upon you and upon the family of yaqub the way he perfected it upon both your forefather ibrahim and ishaq indeed your lord is all knowing wise
Yusuf,31,0.8555,0.0,0.749,0.251,indeed in yusuf and his brother are sign for those who enquire of the truthfulness of prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him the jew who enquired about their story
Yusuf,34,0.8991,0.0,0.715,0.285,when they said indeed yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we are and we are one group undoubtedly our father is clearly deeply engrossed in love of the same mother
Yusuf,29,-0.6908,0.144,0.856,0.0,kill yusuf or throw him somewhere in the land so that your father attention may be directed only towards you and then after it you may again become righteous
Yusuf,28,0.5773,0.064,0.759,0.177,speaker among them said do not kill yusuf and drop him into dark well so that some traveller may come and take him away if you have to
Yusuf,26,-0.1285,0.097,0.788,0.115,they said our father what is the matter with you that you do not trust u with yusuf although we are in fact his well wishers
Yusuf,20,0.34,0.0,0.882,0.118,send him with u tomorrow so that he may eat some fruit and play and indeed we are his protector
Yusuf,34,-0.8126,0.213,0.787,0.0,he said will indeed be saddened by your taking him away and fear that the wolf may devour him whilst you are unaware of him prophet yaqub knew of what wa about to happen
Yusuf,16,0.0258,0.142,0.711,0.147,they said if the wolf devours him whereas we are group then surely we are useless
Yusuf,43,0.8225,0.041,0.748,0.211,so when they took him away and all of them agreed that they should drop him in the dark well and we sent the divine revelation to him you will surely tell them of their deed at time when they will not know
Yusuf,9,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,and at nightfall they came to their father weeping
Yusuf,31,0.4588,0.0,0.906,0.094,saying our father we went far ahead while racing and left yusuf near our resource therefore the wolf devoured him and you will not believe u although we may be truthful
Yusuf,38,0.7184,0.0,0.81,0.19,and they brought his shirt stained with faked blood he said on the contrary your heart have fabricated an excuse for you therefore patience is better and from allah only seek help against the matter that you relate
Yusuf,35,0.7351,0.072,0.725,0.203,and there came caravan so they sent their water drawer he therefore lowered his pail he said what good luck this is boy and they hid him a treasure and allah know what they do
Yusuf,20,0.0516,0.168,0.656,0.176,and the brother sold him for an improper price limited number of coin and they had no interest in him
Yusuf,62,0.3291,0.0,0.946,0.054,and the egyptian who purchased him said to his wife keep him honourably we may derive some benefit due to him or we may adopt him a our son and this is how we established yusuf in the land and that we might teach him how to interpret event and allah is dominant upon his work but most men do not know
Yusuf,22,0.9287,0.0,0.568,0.432,and when he matured to his full strength we bestowed him wisdom and knowledge and this is how we reward the virtuous
Yusuf,49,0.128,0.061,0.85,0.089,and the woman in whose house he wa allured him not to restrain himself and she closed all the door and said come it is you address he said seek the refuge of allah indeed the governor is my master he treat me well undoubtedly the unjust never prosper
Yusuf,53,0.2382,0.099,0.755,0.146,and indeed the woman desired him and he too would have desired her were he not to witness the sign of his lord this is what we did to turn away evil and lewdness from him indeed he is one of our chosen bondman allah saved him and he never desired this immorality
Yusuf,45,-0.9565,0.307,0.693,0.0,and they both raced towards the door and the woman tore his shirt from behind and they both found her husband at the door she said what is the punishment of the one who sought evil with your wife other than prison or painful torture
Yusuf,38,0.5267,0.047,0.825,0.127,said yusuf it wa she who lured me that may not guard myself and witness from her own household testified if his shirt is torn from the front then the woman is truthful and he ha spoken incorrectly
Yusuf,17,-0.3182,0.238,0.628,0.135,and if his shirt is torn from behind then the woman is liar and he is truthful
Yusuf,26,-0.3415,0.228,0.643,0.128,so when the governor saw his shirt torn from behind he said indeed this is deception of woman undoubtedly the deception of woman is very great
Yusuf,16,-0.7269,0.368,0.538,0.094,yusuf disregard this and woman seek forgiveness for your sin indeed you are of the mistaken
Yusuf,30,0.7906,0.061,0.691,0.247,and some woman of the city said the governor wife is seducing her young slave indeed his love ha taken root in her heart and we find her clearly lost
Yusuf,64,-0.2098,0.092,0.827,0.081,and when she heard of their secret talk she sent for them and prepared cushioned mattress for them and gave knife to each one of them and said to yusuf come out before them when the woman saw him they praised him and cut their hand and said purity is to allah this is no human being this is not but an honourable angel
Yusuf,44,-0.0314,0.157,0.687,0.155,she said this is he on whose account you used to insult me and indeed tried to entice him so he safeguarded himself and indeed if he doe not do what tell him to he will surely be imprisoned and will surely be humiliated
Yusuf,34,0.3979,0.082,0.745,0.173,he said my lord prison is dearer to me than the deed they invite me to and if you do not repel their deceit away from me may incline towards them and be unwise
Yusuf,24,-0.4588,0.115,0.885,0.0,so his lord heard his prayer and repelled the woman deceit away from him indeed he only is the all hearing the all knowing
Yusuf,18,-0.4588,0.15,0.85,0.0,then after having seeing all the sign they all decided that he should be imprisoned for some time
Yusuf,47,0.0258,0.065,0.868,0.067,and two young men went to prison along with him one of them said dreamt that am pressing wine the other said dreamt that am carrying some bread upon my head from which bird were eating tell u their interpretation indeed we see that you are virtuous
Yusuf,56,-0.4521,0.114,0.837,0.05,said yusuf the food which you get will not reach you but will tell you the interpretation of this before it come to you this is one of the science my lord ha taught me indeed did not accept the religion of the people who do not believe in allah and are denier of the hereafter
Yusuf,42,-0.4761,0.093,0.863,0.044,and have chosen the religion of my forefather ibrahim and ishaq and yaqub it is not rightful for u to ascribe anything a partner to allah this is grace of allah upon u and upon mankind but most men are not thankful
Yusuf,15,-0.1531,0.18,0.67,0.149,both my fellow prisoner are various lord better or one allah the dominant above all
Yusuf,57,0.1591,0.102,0.803,0.096,you do not worship anything besides him but which are merely name coined by you and your forefather allah ha not sent down any proof regarding them there is no command but that of allah he ha commanded that you do not worship anyone except him this is the proper religion but most people do not know
Yusuf,42,-0.25,0.076,0.848,0.076,my two fellow prisoner one of you will give his lord the king wine to drink regarding the other he will be crucified therefore bird will eat from his head the command ha been given concerning the matter you had enquired about
Yusuf,44,-0.6369,0.11,0.89,0.0,and of the two yusuf said to the one whom he sensed would be released remember me in the company of your lord so satan caused him to forget to mention yusuf to his lord he therefore stayed in prison for several year more
Yusuf,36,0.7717,0.0,0.786,0.214,and the king said saw in dream seven healthy cow whom seven lean cow were eating and seven green ear of corn and seven others dry court member explain my dream if you can interpret dream
Yusuf,15,0.1779,0.126,0.656,0.219,they answered these are confused dream and we do not know the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and of the two the one who wa released said and after long time he had remembered will tell you it interpretation therefore send me forth
Yusuf,39,0.6908,0.0,0.863,0.137,yusuf truthful one explain for u the seven healthy cow which seven lean cow were eating and the seven green ear of corn and seven others dry so may return to the people possibly they may come to know
Yusuf,23,-0.1571,0.068,0.932,0.0,he said you will cultivate for seven year continuously so leave all that you harvest in the ear except little which you eat
Yusuf,24,0.4215,0.053,0.827,0.12,then after that will come seven hard year which will devour all that you had stored for them except little which you may save
Yusuf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then after that will come year when the people will be given rain and in which they will extract juice
Yusuf,42,-0.2023,0.106,0.826,0.068,and the king said bring him to me so when the bearer came to him yusuf said return to your lord and ask him what is the status of the woman who had cut their hand indeed my lord know their deception
Yusuf,51,0.695,0.0,0.877,0.123,the king said woman what wa your role when you tried to entice yusuf they answered purity is to allah we did not find any immorality in him said the wife of the governor now the truth is out it wa who tried to entice him and indeed he is truthful
Yusuf,29,0.8641,0.0,0.729,0.271,said yusuf did this so that the governor may realise that did not betray him behind his back and allah doe not let the deceit of betrayer be successful
Yusuf,30,0.5859,0.114,0.622,0.264,and do not portray my soul a innocent undoubtedly the soul excessively command towards evil except upon whom my lord ha mercy indeed my lord is oft forgiving most merciful
Yusuf,35,0.7351,0.0,0.838,0.162,and the king said bring him to me so that may choose him especially for myself and when he had talked to him he said indeed you are today before u the honourable the trusted
Yusuf,14,0.296,0.0,0.855,0.145,said yusuf appoint me over the treasure of the earth indeed am protector knowledgeable
Yusuf,38,0.7738,0.0,0.819,0.181,and this is how we gave yusuf the control over that land to stay in it wherever he pleased we may convey our mercy to whomever we will and we do not waste the wage of the righteous
Yusuf,17,0.9001,0.0,0.52,0.48,and undoubtedly the reward of the hereafter is better for those who accept faith and remain pious
Yusuf,19,-0.2023,0.091,0.909,0.0,and yusuf brother came and presented themselves before him so he recognised them whereas they remained unaware of him
Yusuf,30,0.6369,0.0,0.873,0.127,and when he provided them with their provision he said bring your step brother to me do you not see that measure in full and that am the best host
Yusuf,26,-0.296,0.081,0.919,0.0,and if you do not bring him to me there shall be no measure provision for you with me and do not ever come near me
Yusuf,14,0.4404,0.0,0.818,0.182,they said we will seek him from his father this we must surely do
Yusuf,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said to his slave place their mean back into their sack perhaps they may recognise it when they return to their home perhaps they may come again
Yusuf,37,0.3818,0.072,0.792,0.136,so when they returned to their father they said our father the provision have been denied to u therefore send our brother with u so that we may bring the provision and we will surely protect him
Yusuf,34,0.9201,0.0,0.696,0.304,he said shall trust you regarding him the same way had trusted you earlier regarding his brother therefore allah is the best protector and he is more merciful than all those who show mercy
Yusuf,58,0.0,0.04,0.92,0.04,and when they opened their belonging they found that their mean had been returned to them they said our father what more can we ask for here are our mean returned to u we may get the provision for our home and guard our brother and get camel load extra giving all these is insignificant for the king
Yusuf,52,0.25,0.0,0.962,0.038,he said shall never send him with you until you give me an oath upon allah that you will bring him back to me unless you are surrounded and recall when they gave him their oath that allah guarantee is upon what we say he knew that bin yamin would be restrained
Yusuf,44,0.4653,0.07,0.839,0.091,and he said my son do not enter all by one gate and enter by different gate cannot save you against allah there is no command but that of allah upon him do rely and all those who trust must rely only upon him
Yusuf,51,0.5647,0.0,0.895,0.105,and when they entered from the place where their father had commanded them to that would not at all have saved them against allah except that it wa yaqub secret wish which he fulfilled and indeed he is possessor of knowledge due to our teaching but most people do not know
Yusuf,31,0.5696,0.0,0.861,0.139,and when they entered in the company yusuf he seated his brother close to him and said be assured really am your brother therefore do not grieve for what they do
Yusuf,30,-0.7184,0.176,0.824,0.0,and when he had provided them their provision he put the drinking cup in his brother bag and then an announcer cried people of the caravan you are indeed thief
Yusuf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they answered and turned towards them what is it you cannot find
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we cannot find the king cup and for him who brings it is camel load and am it guarantor
Yusuf,25,0.3958,0.084,0.742,0.174,they said by allah you know very well that we did not come here to cause turmoil in the land and nor are we thief
Yusuf,14,-0.7579,0.351,0.649,0.0,they said and what shall be the punishment for it if you are liar
Yusuf,29,-0.872,0.276,0.724,0.0,they said the punishment for it is that he in whose bag it shall be found shall himself become slave for it this is how we punish the unjust
Yusuf,58,-0.296,0.037,0.963,0.0,so he first searched their bag before his brother bag then removed it from his brother bag this wa the plan we had taught yusuf he had no right to take his brother by the king law except if allah will we may raise in rank whomever we will and above every possessor of knowledge is another scholar
Yusuf,45,-0.7096,0.176,0.721,0.104,they said if he steal then indeed his brother ha stolen before so yusuf kept this in his heart and did not reveal it to them he replied within himself in fact you are in worse position and allah well know the matter you fabricate
Yusuf,21,0.6486,0.0,0.773,0.227,they said governor he ha very aged father so take one of u in his stead indeed we witness your favour
Yusuf,26,-0.1027,0.109,0.795,0.096,he said the refuge of allah from that we should take anyone except him with whom our property wa found we would then surely be unjust
Yusuf,67,0.7506,0.043,0.829,0.128,so when they did not anticipate anything from him they went away and started consulting each other their eldest brother said do you not know that your father ha taken from you an oath upon allah and before this how you had failed in respect of yusuf therefore will not move from here until my father permit or allah command me and his is the best command
Yusuf,30,-0.2023,0.095,0.833,0.071,return to your father and then submit our father indeed your son ha stolen we were witness only to what we know and we were not guardian of the unseen
Yusuf,20,0.4588,0.0,0.864,0.136,and ask the township in which we were and the caravan in which we came and indeed we are truthful
Yusuf,39,0.7964,0.0,0.816,0.184,said yaqub your soul have fabricated an excuse for you therefore patience is excellent it is likely that allah will bring all of them to me undoubtedly only he is the all knowing the wise all three including yusuf
Yusuf,26,-0.7964,0.228,0.772,0.0,and he turned away from them and said ala the separation from yusuf and his eye turned white with sorrow he therefore kept suppressing his anger
Yusuf,19,-0.6705,0.244,0.756,0.0,they said by allah you will keep remembering yusuf till your health fails you or you lose your life
Yusuf,23,-0.5423,0.271,0.599,0.129,he said complain of my worry and grief only to allah and know the great trait of allah which you do not know
Yusuf,33,0.5725,0.116,0.653,0.23,my son go and search for yusuf and his brother and do not lose hope in the mercy of allah indeed none lose hope in the mercy of allah except the disbelieving people
Yusuf,43,0.9442,0.038,0.603,0.36,then when they reached in the company of yusuf they said governor calamity ha struck u and our household and we have brought good of little value so give u the full measure and be generous to u undoubtedly allah reward the generous
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said are you aware of what you did to yusuf and his brother when you were unwise
Yusuf,41,0.8373,0.0,0.784,0.216,they said are you in truth you really yusuf he said am yusuf and this is my brother indeed allah ha bestowed favour upon u undoubtedly whoever practice piety and patience so allah doe not waste the wage of the righteous
Yusuf,17,0.25,0.136,0.631,0.233,they said by allah undoubtedly allah ha given you superiority over u and we were indeed guilty
Yusuf,26,0.34,0.074,0.772,0.154,he said there is no reproach on you this day may allah forgive you and he is the utmost merciful of all those who show mercy
Yusuf,33,0.836,0.0,0.771,0.229,take along this shirt of mine and lay it on my father face his vision will be restored and bring your entire household to me prophet yusuf knew that this miracle would occur
Yusuf,45,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when the caravan left egypt their father said indeed sense the fragrance of yusuf if you do not call me senile prophet yaqub said this in palestine to other member of his family he could discern the fragrance of prophet yusuf shirt from far away
Yusuf,16,0.7264,0.0,0.697,0.303,they said by allah you are still deeply engrossed in the same old love of yours
Yusuf,49,0.8979,0.0,0.808,0.192,then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid the shirt on his face he therefore immediately regained his eyesight he said wa not telling you know the great trait of allah which you do not know this wa miracle that took place by applying prophet yusuf shirt
Yusuf,14,-0.6486,0.328,0.564,0.108,they said our father seek forgiveness for our sin for we were indeed guilty
Yusuf,21,0.6124,0.0,0.792,0.208,he said shall soon seek forgiveness for you from my lord indeed he only is the oft forgiving the most merciful
Yusuf,24,0.4939,0.0,0.84,0.16,so when they all reached in yusuf company he kept his parent close to him and said enter egypt if allah will in safety
Yusuf,82,0.9062,0.063,0.729,0.208,and he seated his parent on the throne and they all prostrated before him and yusuf said my father this is the interpretation of my former dream my lord ha made it true and indeed he ha bestowed favour upon me when he brought me out of prison and brought you all from the village after satan had created resentment between me and my brother indeed my lord may make easy whatever he will undoubtedly he is the all knowing the wise
Yusuf,65,-0.5267,0.107,0.82,0.074,my lord you have given me kingdom and have taught me how to interpret some event creator of the heaven and the earth you are my supporter in the world and in the hereafter cause me to die a muslim and unite me with those who deserve your proximity prophethood and the rule over egypt prophet yusuf said this prayer while his death approached him
Yusuf,38,0.9217,0.0,0.72,0.28,these are some tidings of the hidden which we divinely reveal to you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him and you were not with them when they set their task and when they were scheming
Yusuf,12,-0.5448,0.311,0.689,0.0,and however much you long for most men will not accept faith
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you do not ask them any fee in return for it this is not but an advice to the entire world
Yusuf,21,0.3612,0.075,0.788,0.137,and how many sign exist in the heaven and the earth over which most people pas and remain unaware of them
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and most of them are such that they do not believe in allah except while ascribing partner to him
Yusuf,23,-0.6486,0.24,0.76,0.0,do they remain complacent over allah punishment coming and surrounding them or the last day coming suddenly upon them whilst they are unaware
Yusuf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,proclaim this is my path call towards allah and whoever follows me are upon perception and purity is to allah and am not of the polytheist
Yusuf,61,0.8689,0.0,0.841,0.159,and all the noble messenger we sent before you were exclusively men towards whom we sent the divine revelation and were dweller of township so have not these people travelled in the land and seen what sort of fate befell those before them and undoubtedly the abode of the hereafter is better for the pious so do you not have sense
Yusuf,43,0.5142,0.148,0.626,0.226,to the extent that when the noble messenger lost hope from the visible mean and the people thought that they had spoken wrongly our help came to them therefore whoever we willed wa saved and our punishment is never averted from the guilty
Yusuf,41,0.5023,0.0,0.925,0.075,indeed in their tidings is enlightenment for the men of understanding this the qur an is not some made up story but confirmation of the book before it and detailed explanation of all thing and guidance and mercy for the muslim
Ar-Rad,45,0.3818,0.0,0.923,0.077,alif lam meem ra these are verse of the book and that which ha been sent down upon you from your lord is true but most men do not believe alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning

Ar-Rad,55,0.4767,0.072,0.793,0.135,and if you are amazed then indeed the amazement is at their saying that will we after having turned to dust be created anew they are those who have disbelieved in their lord and they are those who will have shackle around their neck and they are the people of hell remaining in it forever
Ar-Rad,49,-0.8358,0.241,0.642,0.117,and they urge you to hasten the punishment before the mercy whereas the punishment of those before them have concluded and indeed your lord give the people sort of pardon despite their injustice and indeed the punishment of your lord is severe by delaying their punishment despite their disbelief
Ar-Rad,25,-0.3947,0.1,0.9,0.0,the disbeliever say why is not sign sent down upon him from his lord you are purely herald of warning and guide for all nation

Ar-Rad,18,-0.0772,0.145,0.724,0.131,it is he who show you the lightning for fear and for hope and raise the heavy cloud
Ar-Rad,41,-0.6597,0.202,0.726,0.073,and the thunder proclaims his purity with praise and the angel out of fear of him and he sends the bolt of lightning it therefore strike upon whom he will whilst they are disputing concerning allah and severe is his seizure
Ar-Rad,50,0.9231,0.0,0.759,0.241,only the prayer to him is truthful and whomever they pray to besides him do not hear them at all but like one who ha his hand outstretched towards water that it may come into his mouth and it will never come and every prayer of the disbeliever remains wandering

Ar-Rad,81,-0.3612,0.056,0.917,0.027,he sent down water from the sky so valley flowed according to their measure therefore the water flow brought forth the froth swollen upon it and upon which they ignite the fire to make ornament and tool from that too rise similar froth allah illustrates that this is the example of the truth and the falsehood the froth then burst and disappears and that which is of use to people remains in the earth this is how allah illustrates the example
Ar-Rad,58,-0.0258,0.071,0.845,0.084,for those who obeyed the command of allah is goodness and if those who did not obey him owned all that is in the earth and in addition similar one like it they would give it to redeem their soul it is they who will have wretched account and their destination is hell and what wretched resting place
Ar-Rad,33,-0.1027,0.075,0.861,0.064,so will he who know that what is sent down upon you from your lord is the truth ever be equal to him who is blind only the men of understanding heed advice

Ar-Rad,16,0.936,0.0,0.418,0.582,those who accepted faith and did good deed for them is joy and an excellent outcome
Ar-Rad,67,0.9371,0.056,0.714,0.23,similarly we sent you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him towards the nation before whom other nation have passed away for you to recite to them the divine revelation we sent down to you whereas they are denying the most gracious proclaim he is my lord there is no worship except for him rely only upon him and only towards him is my return
Ar-Rad,86,-0.4943,0.101,0.809,0.089,and were such qur an to come that would cause the mountain to move or the earth to split asunder or the dead to speak even then these disbeliever would not believe in fact all matter are only at allah discretion so have not the muslim despaired in that had allah willed he would have guided all mankind disaster shall continue to strike the disbeliever on account of their deed or descend near their home until allah promise come indeed allah doe not break the promise
Ar-Rad,28,-0.7564,0.287,0.631,0.082,and indeed the noble messenger before you were also mocked therefore gave the mocker respite for some day and then seized them so how dreadful wa my punishment
Ar-Rad,80,-0.0,0.036,0.917,0.048,so is he who keep watch over the deed of every soul equal to their appointed partner and yet they ascribe partner to allah proclaim just name them or is it that you inform him of something which in his knowledge doe not exist in the earth or is it just superficial talk in fact their deceit seems good to the disbeliever and are prevented from the path and whomever allah sends astray so there is none to guide him
Ar-Rad,30,-0.8938,0.311,0.689,0.0,they will be punished in the life of this world and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is the most severe and there is none to save them from allah
Ar-Rad,37,0.7003,0.117,0.667,0.217,description of the paradise which is promised to the pious river flow beneath it it fruit are unending and it shade this is the reward of those who fear and the fate of the disbeliever is fire

Ar-Rad,39,0.223,0.045,0.889,0.067,and similarly we have revealed this a command in arabic and listener follower of this prophet if you follow their desire after the knowledge having come to you then you will have neither supporter nor any saviour against allah
Ar-Rad,38,0.8074,0.0,0.808,0.192,and indeed we sent noble messenger before you and made wife and child for them and it is not the task of any noble messenger to bring sign except by allah command and all promise have time prescribed
Ar-Rad,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah era and confirms whatever he will and only with him is the real script
Ar-Rad,40,0.3182,0.0,0.941,0.059,and whether we show you promise that is given to them or call you to u before it so in any case upon you is just the conveyance and for u is the taking of the account of the message
Ar-Rad,34,-0.1114,0.061,0.862,0.077,do they not perceive that we are reducing their dwelling from all direction and allah give the command there is none that can postpone his command and he spends no time in taking account
Ar-Rad,35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed those before them had plotted therefore allah himself is the master of all strategy he know all what every soul earns and soon will the disbeliever realise for whom is the final abode
Ar-Rad,29,-0.0207,0.078,0.847,0.075,the disbeliever say you are not noble messenger of allah proclaim allah is sufficient witness between me and you and so is he who ha knowledge of the book
Ibrahim,52,0.9391,0.031,0.712,0.257,alif lam ra it is book which we have sent down upon you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him so that you may bring forth people from the realm of darkness into light by the command of their lord towards the path of the most honourable the most praiseworthy
Ibrahim,25,-0.6486,0.261,0.638,0.1,allah because all that is in the heaven and in the earth belongs only to him and woe is for the disbeliever through severe punishment
Ibrahim,28,0.4588,0.081,0.719,0.201,to whom the worldly life is dearer than the hereafter and who prevent from the way of allah and wish deviation in it they are in extreme error
Ibrahim,62,0.9593,0.0,0.738,0.262,and we sent every noble messenger with the same language a his people so that he may clearly explain to them then allah sends astray whomever he will and he guide whomever he will and he only is the most honourable the wise prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him wa taught all the language a he is sent towards all
Ibrahim,52,0.7951,0.034,0.812,0.154,and indeed we sent moosa along with our sign that bring your people from the realm of darkness into light and remind them of the day of allah indeed in them are sign for every greatly enduring grateful person when various favour were bestowed in order to give thanks and be patient
Ibrahim,63,0.8689,0.04,0.785,0.175,and when moosa said to his people remember allah favour upon you when he rescued you from the people of firaun who were inflicting you with dreadful torment and were slaying your son and sparing your daughter and in it occurred great favour of your lord on the th day of moharram therefore the jew used to fast on that day a thanksgiving
Ibrahim,26,-0.7096,0.261,0.653,0.086,and remember when your lord proclaimed if you give thanks will give you more and if you are ungrateful then know that my punishment is severe
Ibrahim,23,0.7645,0.0,0.761,0.239,and moosa said if you and all who are in the earth turn disbeliever then indeed allah is definitely independent unwanting most praiseworthy
Ibrahim,71,0.6022,0.063,0.811,0.126,did not the tidings of those before you reach you the people of nooh and the ad and the thamud and those after them only allah know them their noble messenger came to them with clear proof they therefore raised their hand towards their own mouth and said we disbelieve in what you have been sent with and we are in deeply intriguing doubt regarding the path you call u to
Ibrahim,69,0.765,0.148,0.596,0.256,their noble messenger said what you doubt concerning allah the creator of the heaven and the earth he call you that he may forgive some of your sin and until the time of death give you life free from punishment they said you are just human being like u you wish to prevent u from what our forefather used to worship therefore now bring some clear proof to u
Ibrahim,59,0.765,0.0,0.881,0.119,their noble messenger said to them we are indeed human being like you but allah bestows favour upon whomever he will among his bondman it is not our task to bring any proof to you except by the command of allah and only upon allah must the muslim rely therefore prophet and other men are not equal in status
Ibrahim,43,0.7184,0.057,0.738,0.205,and what is the matter with u that we should not rely on allah he ha in fact shown u our way and we will surely be patient upon the trouble you cause u and those who trust must rely only upon allah
Ibrahim,37,0.34,0.187,0.579,0.234,and the disbeliever said to their noble messenger we will surely expel you from our land unless you accept our religion so their lord sent them the divine revelation that indeed we will destroy these unjust people
Ibrahim,30,-0.8625,0.262,0.738,0.0,and indeed we will establish you in the land after them this is for him who fear to stand before me and fear the command of punishment declared by me
Ibrahim,10,-0.7579,0.517,0.483,0.0,and they sought decision and every stubborn rebel wa destroyed

Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we then awakened them to see which of the two group more accurately tell the period they had stayed
Al-Kahf,24,0.2732,0.0,0.916,0.084,we shall narrate their account to you accurately they were young men who believed in their lord and we increased the guidance for them
Al-Kahf,41,0.5286,0.042,0.841,0.117,and we made their heart steadfast when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth we shall not worship any other deity except him if it were we have then said something excessive
Al-Kahf,32,-0.5686,0.157,0.786,0.057,these the people of ours have set up god besides allah why do they not bring clear proof regarding them and who is more unjust than one who fabricates lie against allah

Al-Kahf,78,0.91,0.0,0.855,0.145,and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him you will see the sun that when it rise it shift away to the right of their cave and when it set it shift away to their left and they are in the open ground of that cave this is from among the sign of allah whomever allah guide only he is therefore guided and whomever he sends astray you will never find for him friend who guide
Al-Kahf,58,-0.4588,0.05,0.95,0.0,and you may think they are awake whereas they are asleep and we turn them over to the right and the left and their dog is on the threshold of the cave with it paw outstretched listener were you to look at them closely you would turn back running away from them and be filled with their dread
Al-Kahf,91,0.6597,0.0,0.943,0.057,and similarly we awakened them so that they may enquire about each other speaker among them said how long have you stayed here some among them said we have stayed day or part of day the others said your lord well know how long you have stayed therefore send one of you to the city with this silver coin he may then check which food available there is purer in order to bring some of it for you to eat and he must be courteous and not inform anyone about you
Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed if they come to know about you they will stone you or turn you back to their religion and if so you will never prosper
Al-Kahf,65,0.3016,0.099,0.76,0.142,and this is how we made them known for people to know that the promise of allah is true and that there is no doubt concerning the last day when the people began disputing among themselves regarding them they said construct building over their cave their lord well know them those who dominated in this matter said we promise we will build mosque over them
Al-Kahf,88,0.8481,0.049,0.8,0.151,so the people will now say they are three their dog is the fourth and some will say they are five their dog is the sixth just blind guess and some will say they are seven and their dog is the eighth proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him my lord well know their number no one know them except few therefore do not debate concerning them except what ha occurred and do not ask any of the people of the book anything concerning them

Al-Kahf,30,0.2263,0.058,0.856,0.086,except if allah will and remember your lord when you forget and say it is likely that my lord will guide me to more accurate way of virtue than this
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they stayed in their cave for three hundred year and nine more according to the solar calendar and according to the lunar calendar
Al-Kahf,43,0.6894,0.038,0.807,0.155,say allah well know how long they stayed for him only are the hidden of the heaven and the earth how well he see and hears they do not have any supporter besides him and he doe not associate anyone in his command
Al-Kahf,30,0.743,0.0,0.816,0.184,and recite the book of your lord which ha been divinely revealed to you there is none who can change his word and you will never find refuge besides him
Al-Kahf,67,0.9274,0.037,0.72,0.243,and restrain yourself along with those who pray to their lord morning and evening seeking his pleasure and may not your sight fall on anything besides them would you desire the adornment of the life of this world and do not follow him whose heart we have made neglectful of our remembrance the one who ha followed his own desire and his matter ha crossed the limit
Al-Kahf,67,-0.836,0.207,0.654,0.139,and proclaim the truth is from your lord so whoever will may accept faith and whoever will may disbelieve we have indeed prepared for the disbeliever fire the wall of which will surround them if they plead for water their plea will be answered with water like molten metal which shall scald their face what an evil drink it is and what an evil destination is hell
Al-Kahf,20,0.629,0.111,0.59,0.3,indeed those who believed and did good deed we do not waste the reward of those whose deed are good
Al-Kahf,50,0.9584,0.0,0.698,0.302,for them are everlasting garden of eden beneath which river flow in it they will be given bracelet of gold to adorn and shall wear green clothes made of fine silk and gold embroidery reclining upon throne in it what an excellent reward and what an excellent abode is paradise
Al-Kahf,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and relate to them the account of the two men to one we gave two garden of grape and covered them with date palm and kept farm between them
Al-Kahf,20,-0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,both the garden gave yield and gave no shortfall in it and we made river to flow between the two
Al-Kahf,29,0.8643,0.0,0.729,0.271,and he had fruit he therefore said to his companion and he used to debate with him exceed you in wealth and am more powerful in respect of men
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he went into his garden and wronging himself said do not think that this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,26,0.7003,0.0,0.805,0.195,do not think that the last day will ever be established and even if return to my lord will surely find haven better than this garden
Al-Kahf,29,0.2732,0.128,0.682,0.19,his companion debating with him answered what you disbelieve in him who ha created you from dust then from drop of liquid and then created you a complete man
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but just say that only allah is my lord and do not ascribe anyone a partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,42,0.506,0.055,0.821,0.124,and why wa it not that you would have said when you entered your garden whatever allah will we do not have any strength except with the help of allah if you had observed me lesser than you in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,31,0.4404,0.0,0.912,0.088,so it is likely that my lord will give me garden better than yours and send bolt of lightning from the sky on your garden it therefore turn into barren plain
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or it water may sink into the earth so you may never be able to find it
Al-Kahf,40,-0.1779,0.109,0.82,0.071,and his fruit were surrounded he therefore remained helplessly wringing his hand upon all that he had spent on it and it lay fallen on it canopy and he say if only had not ascribed any partner to my lord
Al-Kahf,17,-0.6229,0.331,0.554,0.115,and he had no group to help him against allah nor wa he capable of taking revenge
Al-Kahf,29,0.9559,0.0,0.553,0.447,here brought to light is that the authority is only for allah the true the reward he bestows is the best and believing in him ha the best outcome
Al-Kahf,48,0.3612,0.0,0.949,0.051,and relate to them the example of the life of this world like water which we sent down from the sky therefore vegetation of the earth grew forth in abundance with it to become dry hay which the wind scatter and allah is the controller of all thing
Al-Kahf,30,0.9666,0.0,0.516,0.484,wealth and son are ornament of the life of this world and good deed that last their reward is better before your lord and are better in respect of hope
Al-Kahf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the day when we move the hill and you see the earth flattened plain and we shall raise all of them together so not leaving out any one of them
Al-Kahf,39,-0.0284,0.054,0.895,0.051,and everyone shall be presented before your lord in row indeed you have come to u exactly a we had created you for the first time in fact you thought that we shall never appoint promised time for you
Al-Kahf,63,-0.879,0.225,0.681,0.094,and the book shall be placed and you will see the guilty dreading what is written in it and saying woe to u what sort of book is this that it ha not left out any small sin nor great one which it ha not included and they found all that they did confronting them and your lord doe not wrong any one
Al-Kahf,56,-0.875,0.199,0.753,0.048,and recall when we commanded the angel that prostrate before adam so they all prostrated except iblis he wa of the jinni he therefore rebelled against his lord command what you choose him and his offspring a your friend instead of me whereas they are your enemy and what an evil alternative did the unjust get
Al-Kahf,29,0.7579,0.0,0.769,0.231,neither did make them witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor witness their own creation nor doe it befit my majesty to choose misleader a aide
Al-Kahf,37,-0.3818,0.091,0.858,0.051,and the day when he will proclaim call those partner of mine whom you had assumed so they will call out to them they will not answer them and we shall create field of destruction between them
Al-Kahf,23,-0.8126,0.35,0.531,0.119,and when the guilty see hell they will be certain of falling into it and will find no place to escape from it
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have indeed illustrated all kind of example for mankind in this qur an and man is the most quarrelsome of all
Al-Kahf,38,0.3415,0.113,0.699,0.188,and what prevented men from accepting faith when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness from their lord except that the tradition of the former nation come upon them or that they confront various kind of punishment
Al-Kahf,43,-0.5073,0.192,0.702,0.106,and we do not send the noble messenger except a herald of glad tidings and warning and the disbeliever debate by mean of falsehood to drive away the truth with it and they took my sign and warning they were given a mockery
Al-Kahf,63,-0.101,0.054,0.898,0.048,and who is more unjust than one who when reminded of the sign of his lord turn away from them and forgets what his hand have sent forward we have put cover on their heart so a not to understand the qur an and deafness in their ear and even if you call them to guidance they will never attain the right path
Al-Kahf,39,-0.0644,0.051,0.904,0.045,and your lord is the oft forgiver the merciful if he seized them for their deed he would soon send the punishment upon them but for them is an appointed time from which they will not find any refuge
Al-Kahf,20,-0.8591,0.369,0.557,0.073,and these town we destroyed them when they committed injustice and we had set an appointed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,27,0.0258,0.0,0.959,0.041,and recall when moosa said to his assistant will not give up until reach the place where the two sea meet or until have progressed for age
Al-Kahf,36,-0.3182,0.104,0.799,0.097,and when they reached the place where the two sea meet they forgot about their fish and it took it way into the sea making tunnel the dead fish came alive and went into the water
Al-Kahf,27,0.6249,0.0,0.864,0.136,so when they had gone beyond that place moosa said to his assistant bring our breakfast we have indeed faced great exertion in this journey of ours
Al-Kahf,39,0.5927,0.053,0.831,0.117,he said just imagine when we had taken shelter near the rock so indeed forgot the fish and none but satan caused me to forget to mention it and the fish took it way into the sea it amazing
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said moosa this is exactly what we wanted so they came back retracing their step
Al-Kahf,31,0.8481,0.0,0.746,0.254,so they found bondman from amongst our chosen bondman to whom we had given mercy from u and had bestowed the inspired knowledge from ourselves hazrat khidr peace be upon him
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moosa said to him may stay with you upon the condition that you will teach me the righteousness that you have been taught
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said you will never be able to patiently stay with me
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and how will you bear something which your knowledge doe not encompass
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said moosa allah willing you will soon find me patient and will not do anything against your instruction
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said therefore if you stay with me do not ask me about anything until myself mention it to you
Al-Kahf,40,-0.8442,0.176,0.824,0.0,so they both set out until when they had boarded the boat the chosen bondman ruptured the boat said moosa did you make hole in the boat in order to drown it passenger you have indeed done an evil thing
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not say that you will never be able to patiently stay with me
Al-Kahf,19,0.4449,0.0,0.812,0.188,said moosa do not apprehend me upon my forgetting and do not impose difficulty on me in my task
Al-Kahf,36,-0.5095,0.114,0.827,0.058,so they set out again until when they met boy the chosen bondman slew him moosa said did you slay an innocent soul not in retribution for another you have indeed done an extremely evil thing
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell you that you will never be able to patiently stay with me
Al-Kahf,20,0.4215,0.0,0.872,0.128,said moosa if ask you anything after this do not stay with me indeed your condition from me is fulfilled
Al-Kahf,55,-0.5719,0.091,0.863,0.046,so they both set out again until they came to the people of dwelling they asked it people for food they refused to invite them then in the village they both found wall about to collapse and the chosen bondman straightened it said moosa if you wished you could have taken some wage for it
Al-Kahf,24,0.0258,0.0,0.954,0.046,he said this is the parting between you and me shall now tell you the interpretation of the matter you could not patiently bear
Al-Kahf,32,0.0,0.086,0.829,0.086,in respect of the boat it belonged to the poor people who worked on the river so wished to flaw it and behind them wa king who would capture every sound ship
Al-Kahf,22,-0.1531,0.175,0.709,0.116,and in respect of the boy his parent were muslim and we feared that he may incite them to rebellion and disbelief
Al-Kahf,16,0.6597,0.0,0.722,0.278,so we wished that their lord may bestow them child better purer and nearer to mercy
Al-Kahf,84,0.9118,0.0,0.83,0.17,and in respect of the wall it belonged to two orphan boy of the city and beneath it wa their treasure and their father wa virtuous man therefore your lord willed that they should reach their maturity and remove their treasure by the mercy of your lord and have not done this at my own command this is the interpretation of the matter you could not patiently bear hazrat khidr wa given the knowledge of the hidden a in all three explanation he gave
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they ask you regarding zul qarnain say shall recite his story to you
Al-Kahf,15,0.0772,0.0,0.915,0.085,indeed we gave him authority in the land and bestowed him the mean of everything
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he therefore pursued purpose
Al-Kahf,36,0.0,0.083,0.809,0.108,to the extent that when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in muddy spring and found nation there we said zul qarnain either punish them or choose kindness for them
Al-Kahf,27,-0.9022,0.356,0.58,0.063,he submitted regarding one who ha done injustice we shall soon punish him he will then be brought back to his lord who will punish him severely
Al-Kahf,23,0.9149,0.0,0.598,0.402,and regarding one who believed and did good deed so his reward is goodness and we shall soon give him an easy command
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he again pursued purpose
Al-Kahf,29,0.1027,0.0,0.952,0.048,to the extent that when he reached the rising place of the sun he found it rising upon nation for which we had not kept any shelter from it
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so it is and our knowledge encompasses all that he possessed
Al-Kahf,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he again pursued purpose
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,until when he came between two mountain he found before them nation that did not appear to understand any speech
Al-Kahf,36,-0.5719,0.098,0.902,0.0,they said zul qarnain indeed yajuj and majuj are spreading chaos in the land so shall we assign for you consideration upon the condition that you set up wall between u and them gog and magog
Al-Kahf,26,0.8658,0.045,0.623,0.332,he said that which my lord ha given me control over is better therefore help me with strength shall set up barrier between you and them
Al-Kahf,41,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,give me sheet of iron until when he had raised the wall equal to the edge of the two mountain he said blow to the extent that he made it ablaze he said bring me molten copper to pour upon it
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore yajuj and majuj were neither able to surmount it nor could they pierce it
Al-Kahf,29,0.836,0.0,0.716,0.284,he said this is the mercy of my lord then when the promise of my lord arrives he will blow it to bit and my lord promise is true
Al-Kahf,54,0.4404,0.06,0.832,0.108,and on that day we shall release them in group surging like wave one after another and the trumpet will be blown so we shall gather them all together gog and magog will come out during the time of eisa jesus when he come back to earth and cause great destruction in the land
Al-Kahf,10,-0.6808,0.338,0.662,0.0,and we shall bring hell in front of the disbeliever
Al-Kahf,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,the one whose eye were covered from my remembrance and who could not bear to hear truth
Al-Kahf,27,0.1027,0.137,0.655,0.208,do the disbeliever assume that they will be able to choose my bondman a supporter other than me indeed we have prepared hell to welcome the disbeliever
Al-Kahf,20,0.6915,0.124,0.554,0.322,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him shall we inform you whose are the most failed work
Al-Kahf,23,0.1531,0.088,0.802,0.111,of those whose effort are lost in pursuit of the life of this world and they think that they are doing good deed
Al-Kahf,37,-0.4215,0.072,0.928,0.0,the people who disbelieved in the sign of their lord and in the meeting with him therefore all their deed are in vain we shall therefore not establish any weighing for them on the day of resurrection
Al-Kahf,18,-0.0516,0.25,0.507,0.243,this is their reward hell because they disbelieved and made mockery of my verse and my noble messenger
Al-Kahf,15,0.8779,0.0,0.543,0.457,indeed those who believed and did good deed their welcome are the garden of paradise
Al-Kahf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will abide in it for ever never wanting to shift from it
Al-Kahf,36,0.6369,0.0,0.867,0.133,proclaim if the sea became ink for the word of my lord the sea would indeed be used up and the word of my lord would never even if we bring another like it for help
Al-Kahf,57,0.926,0.0,0.748,0.252,proclaim physically am human like you my lord sends divine revelation to me that your god is only one god so whoever expects to the meet his lord must perform good deed and not ascribe anyone a partner in the worship of his lord human but not equal to you in fact the greatest in spiritual status
Maryam,20,-0.1779,0.132,0.766,0.102,kaf ha ya in sad alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
Maryam,14,0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161,this is the remembrance of the mercy of your lord upon his bondman zakaria
Maryam,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when he softly prayed to his lord
Maryam,29,-0.089,0.089,0.832,0.079,he submitted my lord my bone have become weak and old age shine forth from my head and my lord have never been disappointed in my prayer to you
Maryam,24,-0.4939,0.122,0.878,0.0,and fear my relative after me and my wife is barren therefore bestow upon me from yourself one who will take up my work
Maryam,28,0.6369,0.0,0.833,0.167,he being my successor and the heir of the descendant of yaqub jacob and my lord make him cherished one make him prophet among the descendant of israel
Maryam,24,0.3094,0.065,0.823,0.112,zakaria we give you the glad tidings of son whose name is yahya john before him we have not created anyone of this name
Maryam,21,0.1027,0.0,0.935,0.065,he submitted my lord how can have son whereas my wife is barren and have reached infirmity due to old age
Maryam,28,0.5994,0.0,0.841,0.159,he the angel said so it is your lord say this is easy for me in fact created you before this at time when you did not exist
Maryam,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said my lord give me sign he said your token is that you will not speak to people for three night although in proper health
Maryam,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he therefore emerged upon his people from the mosque and told them through gesture keep proclaiming the purity of your lord morning and evening
Maryam,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,yahya hold the book firmly and we gave him prophethood in his infancy prophet yahya wa only year old at that time
Maryam,11,0.4588,0.0,0.769,0.231,and compassion from ourselves and chastity and he wa extremely pious
Maryam,11,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,and wa good to his parent and not forceful nor disobedient
Maryam,25,0.296,0.122,0.688,0.191,and peace is upon him the day he wa born and the day he will taste death and the day he will be raised alive
Maryam,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and remember maryam in the book when she went away from her family to place towards east
Maryam,30,0.7845,0.0,0.774,0.226,so there she screened herself from them we therefore sent our spirit towards her he appeared before her in the form of healthy man angel jibreel peace be upon him
Maryam,15,0.4201,0.151,0.566,0.283,she said seek the refuge of the most gracious from you if you fear god
Maryam,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said am indeed one sent by your lord so that may give you chaste son
Maryam,17,0.4125,0.104,0.662,0.234,she said how can bear son no man ha ever touched me nor am of poor conduct
Maryam,34,0.8528,0.0,0.712,0.288,he said so it is your lord ha said this is easy for me and in order that we make him sign for mankind and mercy from u and this matter ha been decreed
Maryam,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so she conceived him and she went away with him to far place
Maryam,28,-0.6705,0.175,0.825,0.0,then the pang of childbirth brought her to the base of the palm tree she said oh if only had died before this and had become forgotten unremembered
Maryam,19,0.555,0.0,0.788,0.212,the angel therefore called her from below her do not grieve your lord ha made river flow below you
Maryam,30,0.6597,0.049,0.776,0.175,and shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you ripe fresh date will fall upon you this wa miracle the date palm wa dry and it wa winter season
Maryam,33,0.7178,0.0,0.838,0.162,therefore eat and drink and appease your eye so if you meet any person then say have pledged fast of silence to the most gracious will therefore not speak to any person today
Maryam,21,0.2023,0.154,0.629,0.217,so carrying him in her arm she brought him to her people they said maryam you have indeed committed great evil
Maryam,17,-0.8176,0.333,0.667,0.0,sister of haroon neither wa your father an evil man nor wa your mother of poor conduct
Maryam,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereupon she pointed towards the child they said how can we speak to an infant who is in the cradle
Maryam,20,0.34,0.0,0.888,0.112,the child proclaimed am allah bondman he ha given me the book and made me herald of the hidden prophet
Maryam,19,0.8442,0.0,0.606,0.394,and he ha made me blessed wherever be and ordained upon me prayer and charity a long a live
Maryam,15,0.3612,0.139,0.597,0.264,and ha made me good to my mother and not made me forceful ill fated
Maryam,24,0.296,0.126,0.677,0.197,and peace is upon me the day wa born and on the day shall taste death and on the day will be raised alive
Maryam,14,0.0772,0.145,0.694,0.162,this is eisa jesus the son of maryam true statement in which they doubt
Maryam,28,0.0258,0.0,0.959,0.041,it doe not befit allah to appoint someone a his son purity is to him when he ordains matter he just command it be and it thereupon happens
Maryam,19,0.4767,0.0,0.806,0.194,and said eisa indeed allah is my lord and your lord therefore worship him this is the straight path
Maryam,17,-0.1941,0.203,0.626,0.171,then group among them differed so ruin is for the disbeliever from the witnessing of great day
Maryam,25,-0.8402,0.267,0.733,0.0,much will they listen and much will they see on the day when they come to u but today the unjust are in open error
Maryam,26,-0.863,0.357,0.609,0.034,and warn them of the day of regret when the matter will have been decided and they are in neglect and they do not accept faith
Maryam,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we shall inherit the earth and all that is on it and only towards u will they return
Maryam,15,0.5095,0.0,0.81,0.19,and remember ibrahim in the book he wa very truthful herald of the hidden prophet
Maryam,28,-0.0721,0.081,0.847,0.072,when he said to his father my father why do you worship one which neither hears nor see and cannot benefit you in any way his uncle azar
Maryam,23,0.5106,0.0,0.83,0.17,my father indeed knowledge ha come to me which did not come to you therefore follow me will show you the straight path
Maryam,18,-0.7102,0.318,0.542,0.141,my father do not be bondman of the devil indeed the devil is disobedient towards the most gracious
Maryam,20,-0.761,0.348,0.483,0.169,my father fear that punishment from the most gracious may reach you so you would become companion of the devil
Maryam,28,-0.2815,0.135,0.798,0.067,he said what you turn away from my god ibrahim if you do not desist will certainly stone you and keep no relation with me for long while
Maryam,23,0.796,0.072,0.623,0.305,he said stop it peace be upon you shall seek forgiveness for you from my lord indeed he is very kind to me
Maryam,30,0.4588,0.083,0.722,0.194,and shall remain separated from you and all that you worship other than allah and shall worship my lord possibly by worshipping my lord will not be amongst the unfortunate
Maryam,30,0.5719,0.0,0.887,0.113,so when he had separated from them and what they worshipped other than allah we bestowed him ishaq and yaqub and we made each of them herald of the hidden
Maryam,14,0.6486,0.0,0.694,0.306,and we gave them our mercy and assigned for them true and high repute
Maryam,20,0.4588,0.0,0.864,0.136,and remember moosa in the book he wa indeed chosen one and he wa noble messenger herald of the hidden
Maryam,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we called him from the right side of the mountain tur and brought him close to reveal our secret
Maryam,12,0.3612,0.0,0.815,0.185,and with our mercy we bestowed upon him his brother haroon prophet
Maryam,18,0.7964,0.0,0.649,0.351,and remember ismail in the book he wa indeed true to his promise and wa noble messenger prophet
Maryam,18,0.6808,0.0,0.741,0.259,he used to command his people to offer prayer and give charity and wa liked by his lord
Maryam,12,0.5095,0.0,0.77,0.23,and remember idrees in the book he wa indeed very truthful prophet

Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said their knowledge is with my lord recorded in book my lord neither stray nor forgets
Ta-Ha,34,0.34,0.0,0.932,0.068,the one who ha made the earth bed for you and kept operative road for you in it and sent down water from the sky so with it we produced different pair of vegetation

Ta-Ha,31,0.2732,0.0,0.932,0.068,so we will also produce before you similar magic therefore set up an agreed time between u and you from which neither we nor you shall turn away at level place
Ta-Ha,19,0.4939,0.0,0.849,0.151,said moosa your meeting is the day of the festival and that the people be assembled at late morning
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so firaun went away and gathered his scheme then came magician and their material
Ta-Ha,29,-0.9081,0.343,0.597,0.06,moosa said to them ruin is to you do not fabricate lie against allah that he may destroy you by punishment and indeed one who fabricates lie ha failed
Ta-Ha,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they differed with one another in their task and secretly conferred
Ta-Ha,28,0.2023,0.17,0.612,0.218,they said undoubtedly these two are magician for sure who wish to expel you from your land by the strength of their magic and destroy your exemplary religion
Ta-Ha,16,0.7717,0.0,0.58,0.42,therefore strengthen your scheme and come forth in row indeed whoever dominates this day ha succeeded
Ta-Ha,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said moosa either you throw first or shall we throw first
Ta-Ha,28,0.4939,0.0,0.89,0.11,he said rather you may throw thereupon their cord and their stave by the strength of their magic appeared to him a if they were serpent moving fast
Ta-Ha,7,-0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,and moosa sensed fear in his heart
Ta-Ha,11,0.3875,0.0,0.792,0.208,we said do not fear it is you who is dominant
Ta-Ha,33,-0.4352,0.155,0.764,0.081,and cast down which is in your right hand it will devour all that they have fabricated what they have made is only magician deceit and magician is never successful wherever he come
Ta-Ha,24,0.6597,0.0,0.803,0.197,therefore all the magician were thrown down prostrate they said we accept faith in the one who is the lord of haroon and moosa
Ta-Ha,59,0.3832,0.133,0.71,0.156,said firaun you accepted faith in him before permitted you he is indeed your leader who taught you magic therefore swear will cut off your hand and your leg from alternate side and crucify you on the trunk of palm tree and you will surely come to know among u two whose punishment is more severe and more lasting
Ta-Ha,42,0.743,0.0,0.813,0.187,they said we shall never prefer you above the clear proof that have come to u from the one who ha created u therefore carry out what you want to only in the life of this world will you be able to
Ta-Ha,33,0.3182,0.159,0.602,0.239,indeed we have accepted faith in our lord so that he may forgive u our sin and the magic which you forced u to perform and allah is better and the most lasting
Ta-Ha,21,-0.8126,0.28,0.72,0.0,indeed the one who come guilty to his lord so undoubtedly for him is hell neither dying nor living in it
Ta-Ha,21,0.4404,0.0,0.868,0.132,and the one who present himself a believer before him having done good deed so for them are the high rank
Ta-Ha,23,0.5719,0.0,0.856,0.144,everlasting garden of eden beneath which river flow abiding in them for ever and this is the reward of one who became pure
Ta-Ha,37,0.6093,0.144,0.649,0.207,and we divinely inspired moosa that journey with my bondman in part of the night and strike dry path in the sea for them you shall have no fear of firaun getting to you nor any danger
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so firaun went after them with his army therefore the sea enveloped them the way it did
Ta-Ha,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and firaun led his people astray and did not guide them
Ta-Ha,31,-0.1779,0.099,0.822,0.079,descendant of israel indeed we rescued you from your enemy and we made covenant with you on the right side of mount tur and sent down manna and salwa upon you
Ta-Ha,37,0.8225,0.055,0.702,0.243,eat the good clean thing we have provided you and do not exceed the limit in respect of it causing my wrath to descend upon you and indeed the one on whom my wrath descended ha fallen
Ta-Ha,22,0.8744,0.0,0.621,0.379,and indeed am most oft forgiving for him who repented and accepted faith and did good deed and then remained upon guidance
Ta-Ha,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and why did you come in haste ahead of your people moosa
Ta-Ha,19,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,he submitted they are here just behind me and my lord hastened towards you in order to please you
Ta-Ha,17,0.34,0.0,0.87,0.13,he said we have therefore tried your people after you came and samri ha led them astray
Ta-Ha,47,-0.0516,0.158,0.671,0.171,so moosa turned back to his people angry and grieving he said my people had not your lord given you good promise did long time pas away for you or did you wish that your lord wrath come upon you therefore you broke your promise with me
Ta-Ha,37,-0.4939,0.095,0.864,0.041,they said we did not renege on our promise to you on our own will but we were made to carry the burden of ornament of the people so we cast them and similarly did samri cast
Ta-Ha,28,0.7351,0.056,0.676,0.268,he therefore made calf for them lifeless body making sound like cow so they said this is your god and the god of moosa whereas moosa ha forgotten
Ta-Ha,26,-0.0772,0.172,0.665,0.163,so do they not see that it doe not answer to any of their speech and ha no power to cause them any harm or benefit
Ta-Ha,35,0.3384,0.063,0.838,0.099,and undoubtedly haroon had told them before it that my people you have needlessly fallen into trial because of this and indeed your lord is the most gracious therefore follow me and obey my command
Ta-Ha,17,0.3818,0.0,0.852,0.148,they said we will continue to squat before it till moosa return to u continue worshipping it
Ta-Ha,12,0.0258,0.0,0.909,0.091,said moosa haroon what prevented you when you saw them going astray
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that you did not come after me so did you disobey my order
Ta-Ha,38,-0.4939,0.08,0.92,0.0,he said son of my mother do not clutch my beard nor the hair on my head feared that you may say you have caused division among the descendant of israel and did not wait for my advice
Ta-Ha,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said moosa and what is your explanation samri
Ta-Ha,46,0.5267,0.0,0.93,0.07,he said witnessed what the people did not witness therefore took handful from the track of the angel then threw it and this is what seemed pleasing to my soul the mark left behind by the mount of angel jibreel into the mouth of the calf
Ta-Ha,66,-0.128,0.063,0.896,0.041,said moosa therefore go away for in this life your punishment is that you exclaim do not touch and indeed for you is time appointed which you cannot break and look at your deity in front of which you remained squatting the whole day we swear we will surely burn it and smashing it into bit discharge it into the river he wa cursed with disease
Ta-Ha,18,0.2732,0.102,0.698,0.2,your god is only allah other than for whom there is no worship his knowledge encompasses all thing
Ta-Ha,31,0.8519,0.0,0.751,0.249,this is how we relate the former tidings to you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him and we have given you remembrance from ourselves the holy qur an

Ta-Ha,19,-0.4215,0.135,0.865,0.0,on the day when the trumpet is blown and we shall assemble the guilty on that day blue eyed
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,whispering secretly among themselves you have not stayed on earth but for ten day
Ta-Ha,20,0.6369,0.0,0.776,0.224,we know well what they will utter whereas the wisest among them will say you have stayed just for day
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they ask you regarding the mountain proclaim my lord will blow them into bit and scatter them
Ta-Ha,9,-0.2023,0.205,0.795,0.0,therefore leaving the earth just a an empty plain
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in which you shall neither see ups nor down
Ta-Ha,32,0.4005,0.061,0.831,0.108,on that day they will run after caller there will be no deviation in it and voice shall become hushed before the most gracious so you will not hear except faint sound
Ta-Ha,51,0.9718,0.032,0.606,0.363,on that day no one intercession shall benefit except his to whom the most gracious ha given permission and whose word he ha liked the holy prophet and virtuous people will be given the permission to intercede prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him will be the first to intercede
Ta-Ha,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he know all that is before them and all that is behind them whereas their knowledge cannot encompass it
Ta-Ha,22,-0.8591,0.38,0.543,0.077,and all face shall bow before the living the all sustaining and the one who bore the burden of injustice ha failed
Ta-Ha,22,-0.3374,0.277,0.488,0.235,and the one who doe some good deed and is muslim he shall have no fear of injustice nor suffer any loss
Ta-Ha,33,-0.4588,0.165,0.722,0.113,and this is how we revealed it a an arabic qur an and in different way gave promise of punishment that they may fear or it may create some pondering in their heart
Ta-Ha,41,0.9719,0.0,0.579,0.421,therefore supreme is allah the true king and do not hasten in the qur an dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him until it divine revelation ha been completed to you and pray my lord bestow me more knowledge
Ta-Ha,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed before this we made covenant with adam so he forgot and we did not find it intention in him
Ta-Ha,17,-0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,and when we commanded the angel prostrate before adam so they all prostrated except iblis he refused
Ta-Ha,27,-0.3612,0.175,0.725,0.1,we therefore said adam he is your and your wife enemy so may he not get you both out from heaven so you then fall into hardship
Ta-Ha,15,0.5106,0.0,0.809,0.191,indeed for you in heaven is that you may never be hungry nor be unclothed
Ta-Ha,11,0.0382,0.182,0.625,0.193,and that you never feel thirsty nor hot sunshine hurt you
Ta-Ha,20,-0.6887,0.198,0.802,0.0,so the devil incited him saying adam shall show you the tree of immortality and kingdom that doe not erode
Ta-Ha,39,-0.0355,0.101,0.823,0.075,so they both ate from it thereupon their shame became manifest to them and they started applying on themselves the leaf of heaven and adam lapsed in obeying his lord so did not reach his goal of achieving immortality
Ta-Ha,15,0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,then his lord chose him and inclined towards him with his mercy and guided him
Ta-Ha,40,0.2805,0.076,0.802,0.122,he said both of you go down from heaven one of you is an enemy to the other then if the guidance from me come to you then whoever follows my guidance will not go astray nor be ill fated
Ta-Ha,25,-0.4019,0.101,0.899,0.0,and the one who turned away from my remembrance for him is confined existence and we shall raise him blind on the day of resurrection
Ta-Ha,14,-0.4019,0.172,0.828,0.0,he will say my lord why have you raised me blind whereas wa sighted
Ta-Ha,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he will say similarly did our sign come to you but you forgot them and in the same way nobody will heed you today
Ta-Ha,34,-0.7104,0.245,0.67,0.085,and this is how we reward him who transgresses and doe not accept faith in the sign of his lord and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is the most severe and more lasting
Ta-Ha,30,-0.4359,0.166,0.721,0.114,so did they not gain guidance from knowing how many generation we have destroyed before them among whose dwelling they walk indeed in it are sign for men of intellect
Ta-Ha,22,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and had not command of your lord been passed then the punishment would have gripped them and had term not been appointed
Ta-Ha,62,0.9786,0.0,0.672,0.328,therefore dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him patiently forbear upon their speech and praising your lord proclaim his purity before the sun rise and before it set and proclaim his purity at some time of the night and at the two end of the day in the hope that you be pleased with the great reward from your lord
Ta-Ha,43,0.7834,0.031,0.818,0.151,and listener do not extend your eye towards what we have given to disbelieving couple to enjoy the bloom of the worldly life so that we may test them with it and the sustenance of your lord is the best and more lasting
Ta-Ha,33,0.6908,0.0,0.845,0.155,and command your household to establish prayer and yourself be steadfast in it we do not ask any sustenance from you we will provide you sustenance and the excellent result is for piety
Ta-Ha,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the disbeliever said why doe he not bring to u sign from his lord did not the explanation of what is in the former book come to them
Ta-Ha,42,-0.5267,0.218,0.627,0.155,and had we destroyed them with some punishment before the advent of noble messenger they would have certainly said our lord why did you not send noble messenger to u so we would have followed your sign before being humiliated and disgraced
Ta-Ha,29,0.34,0.0,0.921,0.079,proclaim each one is waiting so you too wait very soon you will come to know who are the people of the right path and who ha attained guidance
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.4588,0.214,0.786,0.0,the people reckoning is near whereas they are in neglect turned away
Al-Anbiya,18,0.2023,0.0,0.904,0.096,whenever new advice come to them from their lord they do not listen to it except while playing
Al-Anbiya,28,0.1531,0.099,0.753,0.148,their heart are involved in play and the unjust secretly conferred what is he except another human like you so do you follow magic although you have perceived
Al-Anbiya,28,0.5106,0.0,0.891,0.109,and the prophet said my lord know all that is spoken in the heaven and in the earth and he only is the all hearing the all knowing
Al-Anbiya,33,0.7351,0.044,0.747,0.209,rather they said these are confused dream but in fact he ha fabricated it but in fact he is poet so he must bring u some sign like those who were sent before
Al-Anbiya,19,0.3875,0.0,0.873,0.127,there is not township before them which did not believe which we have not destroyed so will they believe
Al-Anbiya,28,0.5574,0.0,0.882,0.118,and we did not send prophet before you except men to whom we sent divine revelation therefore people ask the people of knowledge if you do not know
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.2057,0.083,0.917,0.0,and we did not create them without body so they would not eat food nor that they abide on earth forever
Al-Anbiya,18,0.5719,0.127,0.558,0.315,we then fulfilled the promise to them therefore rescued them and whomever we willed and destroyed the transgressor
Al-Anbiya,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we have indeed sent down towards you book in which is your repute so do you not have sense
Al-Anbiya,17,-0.7003,0.298,0.614,0.088,and many township did we destroy for they were unjust and we created other nation after them
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,and when they tasted our punishment they immediately started fleeing from it
Al-Anbiya,27,0.2732,0.048,0.865,0.087,the angel said to them do not flee and return to the comfort that were given to you and to your home perhaps you will be questioned
Al-Anbiya,9,-0.8271,0.635,0.365,0.0,they cried woe to u we were indeed unjust
Al-Anbiya,12,-0.2732,0.16,0.84,0.0,so they kept saying this until we made them cut off extinguished
Al-Anbiya,17,-0.5334,0.228,0.772,0.0,and we have not created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them unnecessarily
Al-Anbiya,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if we willed to choose pastime we could have chosen it from ourselves if we wanted to
Al-Anbiya,29,-0.4767,0.147,0.737,0.116,but in fact we hurl the truth upon falsehood so it scatter it brain thereupon it vanishes and for you is the ruin due to the matter you fabricate
Al-Anbiya,30,0.2769,0.065,0.836,0.099,and to him only belong all those who are in the heaven and in the earth and those with him are not conceited towards worshipping him nor do they tire
Al-Anbiya,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they say his purity night and day and do not slacken
Al-Anbiya,10,0.4939,0.0,0.656,0.344,have they appointed from the earth god that create something
Al-Anbiya,41,0.6808,0.065,0.735,0.2,if other than allah there were god in the heaven and the earth they would be destroyed therefore purity is to allah owner of the throne from the matter that they fabricate which is not possible the heaven and the earth
Al-Anbiya,13,0.1511,0.0,0.809,0.191,he is not questioned whatever he doe whereas they will all be questioned
Al-Anbiya,40,-0.2247,0.058,0.905,0.037,or have they set up other god besides allah say bring your proof this is the remembrance of those with me and those before me but in fact most of them do not know the truth so they turn away
Al-Anbiya,27,0.6966,0.181,0.541,0.278,and we did not send any noble messenger before you but we divinely revealed to him that there is no god except allah therefore worship me alone
Al-Anbiya,19,0.8648,0.0,0.623,0.377,and they said the most gracious ha chosen son purity is to him in fact they are honourable bondman
Al-Anbiya,14,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,they do not speak before he ha and they act only at his command
Al-Anbiya,56,0.8555,0.048,0.763,0.189,he know what is before them and what is behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom he like and they fear with awe of him the holy prophet and virtuous people will be given the permission to intercede prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him will be the first to intercede
Al-Anbiya,24,-0.7579,0.313,0.526,0.161,and the one among them who say am god beside allah we shall reward him with hell this is how we punish the unjust
Al-Anbiya,31,-0.0557,0.126,0.782,0.092,did not the disbeliever observe that the heaven and the earth were together so we parted them and we made every living thing from water so will they not accept faith
Al-Anbiya,31,0.1326,0.0,0.95,0.05,and we have placed mountain a anchor in the earth so that it may not shake with them and we kept wide road in it so that they may find guidance
Al-Anbiya,15,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172,and we have made the sky roof protected and they turn away from it sign
Al-Anbiya,23,0.25,0.0,0.917,0.083,and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each one float in an orbit
Al-Anbiya,22,0.25,0.0,0.913,0.087,and before you we did not appoint on earth never ending life for any human will they if you depart become immortal

Al-Anbiya,37,-0.1298,0.169,0.697,0.135,and when the disbeliever see you they do not appoint you except a an object of mockery is he the one who speaks ill of your god whereas they deny the remembrance of the most gracious himself
Al-Anbiya,16,0.6472,0.0,0.674,0.326,man ha been created hasty very soon shall show you my sign do not be impatient
Al-Anbiya,12,0.6833,0.0,0.64,0.36,and they say when will this promise occur if you are truthful
Al-Anbiya,31,-0.5574,0.137,0.863,0.0,if only the disbeliever realised the time when they will not be able to stop the fire from their face and from their back and nor are they to be helped
Al-Anbiya,26,-0.4019,0.097,0.903,0.0,in fact it will suddenly come upon them therefore shocking them and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be given respite
Al-Anbiya,17,-0.8381,0.439,0.481,0.08,and indeed the noble messenger before you were mocked at but their mockery ruined the mocker themselves
Al-Anbiya,23,0.5984,0.0,0.85,0.15,proclaim who guard you night and day from the most gracious in fact they have turned away from the remembrance of their lord
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.4912,0.297,0.527,0.177,do they have some god who protect them from u neither can they save themselves nor save their friend from u
Al-Anbiya,40,0.6124,0.0,0.907,0.093,but in fact we have given these disbeliever and their father benefit to the extent that life became long for them so do they not see that we are reducing the land from it border so will these be victorious
Al-Anbiya,27,0.886,0.094,0.561,0.345,proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him warn you only with the divine revelation and the deaf do not hear the call when warned
Al-Anbiya,22,-0.7845,0.324,0.592,0.084,and if whiff of your lord punishment were to touch them they would certainly say woe to u we were indeed unjust

Al-Furqan,29,-0.4497,0.144,0.768,0.088,and the disbeliever said this is nothing but slur he ha fabricated and others have helped him upon it so indeed the disbeliever have stooped to injustice and lie

Ash-Shuara,13,0.7269,0.0,0.643,0.357,and he drew forth his hand thereupon it shone bright before the beholder
Ash-Shuara,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said firaun to the court member around him he is indeed an expert magician
Ash-Shuara,17,-0.0516,0.141,0.728,0.131,he wish to expel you out of your land by his magic so what is your advice

Ash-Shuara,18,0.5719,0.0,0.821,0.179,so when the magician came they said to firaun will we get some reward if we are victorious
Ash-Shuara,11,0.4019,0.0,0.787,0.213,he said yes and you will then become close to me
Ash-Shuara,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moosa said to them cast whatever you intend to cast
Ash-Shuara,20,0.5719,0.0,0.837,0.163,so they threw down their rope and their stave and exclaimed by the honour of firaun indeed victory is ours
Ash-Shuara,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore moosa put forth his staff so it immediately began swallowing all their fabrication
Ash-Shuara,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the magician therefore fell down prostrate
Ash-Shuara,12,0.7184,0.0,0.562,0.438,they said we have accepted faith in the lord of the creation
Ash-Shuara,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moosa and haroon
Ash-Shuara,44,0.802,0.064,0.734,0.203,said firaun you accepted faith in him before permitted you he is indeed your leader who taught you magic so now you will come to know swear will certainly cut off your hand and your foot from alternate side and crucify all of you
Ash-Shuara,12,-0.6908,0.363,0.637,0.0,they said no harm in it we will return to our lord
Ash-Shuara,17,0.3818,0.124,0.619,0.258,we hope that our lord will forgive u our mistake a we are the first to believe
Ash-Shuara,22,0.5574,0.0,0.854,0.146,and we sent the divine revelation to moosa that journey along with my bondman within the night for you will be pursued
Ash-Shuara,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so firaun sent gatherer into the city
Ash-Shuara,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they announced these people are small group
Ash-Shuara,8,-0.5106,0.355,0.645,0.0,and indeed they have angered all of u
Ash-Shuara,7,0.296,0.0,0.732,0.268,and indeed we are an alert army
Ash-Shuara,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we therefore got them out from the garden and water spring
Ash-Shuara,6,0.6124,0.0,0.444,0.556,and from treasure and nice house
Ash-Shuara,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so it wa and we made the descendant of israel it inheritor
Ash-Shuara,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the firaun people followed them at sunrise
Ash-Shuara,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when the two group saw each other those with moosa said they have caught u
Ash-Shuara,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,said moosa never indeed my lord is with me he will now show me the way
Ash-Shuara,26,0.7845,0.047,0.69,0.263,so we sent the divine revelation to moosa that strike the sea with your staff thereupon the sea parted so each part wa like huge mountain
Ash-Shuara,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we brought the others close to that place
Ash-Shuara,9,0.4215,0.0,0.741,0.259,and we saved moosa and all those with him
Ash-Shuara,4,-0.5994,0.565,0.435,0.0,then drowned the others
Ash-Shuara,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,indeed in this is surely sign and most of them were not muslim
Ash-Shuara,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed your lord only he is the almighty the most merciful
Ash-Shuara,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recite to them the news of ibrahim

Ash-Shuara,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,did you not see that they keep wandering in every valley
Ash-Shuara,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they speak what they do not do
Ash-Shuara,49,-0.7269,0.203,0.692,0.105,except those who believed and did good deed and profusely remembered allah and took revenge after they had been wronged and soon the unjust will come to know upon which side they will be overturned the muslim poet who praise allah and the prophet the disbeliever will be punished
An-Naml,28,0.3818,0.0,0.912,0.088,ta seen these are verse of the qur an and the clear book alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
An-Naml,7,0.4588,0.0,0.667,0.333,guidance and glad tidings for the believer
An-Naml,16,0.5423,0.073,0.674,0.254,those who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and are certain of the hereafter
An-Naml,21,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made their deed seem good to them so they are astray
An-Naml,19,-0.7579,0.358,0.502,0.14,it is they for whom is the worst punishment and they will be the greatest loser in the hereafter
An-Naml,23,0.9081,0.0,0.605,0.395,and indeed you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him are taught the qur an from the wise the all knowing
An-Naml,31,-0.128,0.072,0.871,0.057,remember when moosa said to his wife have sighted fire will soon bring it news to you or bring for you an ember from it so that you may warm yourselves
An-Naml,39,0.6444,0.053,0.777,0.17,so when he reached it it wa proclaimed blessed is he who is in the location of the fire moosa and those who are close to it the angel and purity is to allah the lord of the creation
An-Naml,10,0.6597,0.0,0.597,0.403,moosa am indeed in truth allah the almighty the wise
An-Naml,36,0.8676,0.0,0.748,0.252,and put down your staff so when he saw it writhing like serpent he turned moving away without looking back we said moosa do not fear indeed the noble messenger do not fear in my presence
An-Naml,25,-0.5267,0.233,0.603,0.164,except the one who doe injustice and then after evil change it for virtue then indeed am oft forgiving most merciful other than the prophet
An-Naml,33,0.128,0.073,0.84,0.087,and put your hand inside your armpit it will come out shining white not due to any illness sign among the nine sign towards firaun and his people they are indeed lawless nation
An-Naml,14,0.7096,0.0,0.67,0.33,then when our enlightening sign came to them they said this is clear magic
An-Naml,27,-0.4767,0.194,0.674,0.132,and they denied them whereas in their heart they were certain of them due to injustice and pride therefore see what sort of fate befell the mischievous
An-Naml,29,0.8779,0.0,0.712,0.288,and we indeed bestowed great knowledge to dawud and sulaiman and they both said all praise is to allah who bestowed u superiority over many of his believing bondman
An-Naml,30,0.7411,0.0,0.817,0.183,and sulaiman became dawud heir and he said people we have indeed been taught the language of bird and have been given from all thing this surely is manifest favour
An-Naml,21,-0.3818,0.115,0.885,0.0,and assembled together for sulaiman were his army of jinns and men and of bird so they had to be restricted
An-Naml,26,-0.1531,0.06,0.94,0.0,until when they came to the valley of the ant she ant exclaimed ant enter your house may not sulaiman and his army crush you unknowingly
An-Naml,67,0.957,0.0,0.752,0.248,he therefore smiled beamingly at her speech and submitted my lord bestow me guidance so that thank you for the favour which you bestowed upon me and my parent and so that may perform the good deed which please you and by your mercy include me among your bondman who are worthy of your proximity prophet sulaiman heard the voice of the she ant from far away
An-Naml,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he surveyed the bird he therefore said what is to me that do not see the hudhud hoopoe or is he really absent
An-Naml,17,-0.5859,0.278,0.609,0.113,will indeed punish him severely or slay him or he must bring to me some clear evidence

An-Naml,28,0.607,0.079,0.699,0.223,and you will not guide the blind out of their error and none listen to you except those who accept faith in our sign and they are muslim
An-Naml,45,-0.2996,0.093,0.86,0.047,and when the word promise appears upon them we shall bring forth for them beast from the earth to speak to them because the people were not accepting faith in our sign this beast will rise from the earth when the last day draw near
An-Naml,30,-0.1531,0.085,0.848,0.067,and the day when we will raise from every nation an army that denies our sign so the former group will be held back for the latter to join them
An-Naml,29,-0.4011,0.12,0.88,0.0,until when they all come together he will say did you deny my sign whereas your knowledge had not reached it or what were the deed you were doing

An-Naml,34,0.1779,0.098,0.762,0.14,and the day when the trumpet is blown so all those who are in the heaven and the earth will be terrified except whomever allah will and everyone ha come to him in submission
An-Naml,35,0.7845,0.0,0.802,0.198,and you will see the mountain presuming them fixed whereas they will be moving like the cloud this is allah making who created all thing with wisdom indeed he is informed of what you do

An-Naml,22,-0.4767,0.231,0.644,0.125,and whoever brings evil so their face will be dipped into the fire what reward will you get except what you did
An-Naml,37,0.8834,0.0,0.745,0.255,prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him have been commanded to worship the lord of this city who ha deemed it sacred and everything belongs to him and have been commanded to be among the obedient
An-Naml,31,0.4404,0.067,0.784,0.148,and to recite the qur an so whoever attained the right path ha attained it for his own good and whoever go astray so say indeed am only herald of warning
An-Naml,39,0.9259,0.0,0.701,0.299,and proclaim all praise is to allah he will soon show you his sign so you will recognise them and dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him your lord is not unaware of what you people do
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ta seen meem alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
Al-Qasas,7,0.3818,0.0,0.698,0.302,these are verse of the clear book
Al-Qasas,18,0.6808,0.0,0.741,0.259,we shall narrate to you the true tidings of moosa and firaun for the people who have faith
Al-Qasas,35,-0.7783,0.184,0.773,0.043,indeed firaun had achieved dominance in the earth and made it people subservient to him seeing group among them weak he used to kill their son and spare their woman he wa indeed very mischievous
Al-Qasas,31,0.4939,0.078,0.757,0.165,and we willed to favour those who were weak in the earth and to make them leader and to make them the inheritor of the land and wealth of firaun people
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and to give them control in the land and to show firaun and haman and their army what they fear from them
Al-Qasas,43,-0.2677,0.158,0.724,0.118,and we inspired the mother of moosa that suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve we shall indeed return him back to you and make him one of the noble messenger
Al-Qasas,28,-0.8658,0.28,0.72,0.0,so the family of firaun picked him up in order that he become their enemy and sorrow upon them indeed firaun and haman and their army were guilty
Al-Qasas,47,0.9176,0.032,0.684,0.283,and firaun wife said this child is the comfort of my eye and yours do not kill him perhaps he may benefit u or we may adopt him a our son and they were unaware had firaun also said the same allah would have granted him faith
Al-Qasas,36,0.397,0.106,0.725,0.169,and in the morning the heart of moosa mother became impatient and she would have almost certainly given away his secret had we not strengthened her heart so that she may have faith in our promise
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and she said to his sister go after him she therefore observed him from far and they were not aware
Al-Qasas,29,-0.1779,0.088,0.846,0.066,and we had already forbidden suckle nurse for him so she said shall show you household that will nurse this child of yours and they are his well wishers
Al-Qasas,30,0.5983,0.0,0.79,0.21,so we returned him to his mother in order to soothe her eye and not grieve and to know that allah promise is true but most people do not know
Al-Qasas,23,0.9337,0.0,0.544,0.456,and when he reached his maturity and full strength we gave him wisdom and knowledge and this is how we reward the virtuous
Al-Qasas,83,-0.9643,0.227,0.746,0.027,and he entered the city when it inhabitant were sleeping unaware in the afternoon he therefore found two men fighting one wa from moosa group and the other from among his enemy so the one who wa of moosa group pleaded to moosa for help against him who wa of his enemy therefore moosa punched him thereby finishing him he said this act wa from the devil indeed he is an open enemy misleader the act of oppressing the man from ban israel
Al-Qasas,29,0.0516,0.165,0.638,0.197,he said my lord have indeed wronged my soul therefore forgive me he therefore forgave him indeed only he is the oft forgiving the most merciful by getting angry
Al-Qasas,20,-0.1813,0.188,0.693,0.118,he said my lord the way you have bestowed favour upon me so never will be supporter of the guilty
Al-Qasas,42,-0.34,0.135,0.757,0.108,so he wa in the city at morning fearing waiting to see what happens thereupon he sighted the one who had appealed to him the day before cry out to him for help moosa said to him indeed you are clearly astray
Al-Qasas,45,-0.8519,0.219,0.688,0.093,so when moosa wished to apprehend the man who wa an enemy to them both he said moosa do you wish to kill me the way you killed man yesterday you only wish to become strict ruler in the land and not to make reform
Al-Qasas,30,-0.1027,0.121,0.742,0.137,and man came running from the outer part of the city he said moosa indeed the court member are considering killing you therefore go away surely am your well wisher
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.226,0.66,0.115,so he left the city in fear waiting to see what happens he said my lord rescue me from the unjust people
Al-Qasas,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he turned his attention towards madyan he said it is likely that my lord will show me the right path
Al-Qasas,60,0.0258,0.0,0.982,0.018,and when he came to the water of madyan he found group of men watering their animal and away from them he found two woman restraining their animal he said what is the matter with you they said we do not water our animal till all the shepherd water and take away their animal and our father is very old
Al-Qasas,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore moosa watered their animal for them and then turned towards the shade and said my lord am in need of the sustenance you may send down for me
Al-Qasas,53,0.1351,0.085,0.82,0.094,so one of the two woman approached him walking shyly she said my father is calling you in order to give you wage because you watered our animal for u when moosa came to him and had told him the story he said do not fear you are safe from the unjust people
Al-Qasas,17,0.8689,0.0,0.588,0.412,one of the two woman said my father employ him indeed strong and trustworthy employee is better
Al-Qasas,57,0.4767,0.037,0.875,0.088,he said wish to give you one of these two daughter of mine in marriage the bridal money being that you work for me for eight year then if you complete ten year it will be from you and do not wish to put you in hardship allah willing you will probably find me of the righteous
Al-Qasas,33,0.2263,0.061,0.826,0.113,said moosa this is agreed between me and you there shall be no claim upon me if fulfil any of these two term and allah is the trustee upon this word of ours
Al-Qasas,55,-0.4404,0.082,0.886,0.032,so when moosa completed his term and wa travelling with his wife he saw fire in the direction of the mount sinai he said to his wife stay here have sighted fire in the direction of the mount perhaps may bring you some news from it or an ember so that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,35,0.7845,0.056,0.703,0.241,and when he reached the fire he wa called out to from the right side of the valley in the blessed field from the tree moosa indeed am truly allah the lord of the creation
Al-Qasas,31,0.8238,0.0,0.764,0.236,put down your staff so when moosa saw it writhing like serpent he turned moving away without looking back moosa come forth and do not fear indeed you are in peace
Al-Qasas,47,0.128,0.107,0.778,0.116,put your hand inside your armpit it will come out shining white not due to any illness and put your hand on your chest to remove the fear so these are two proof from your lord to firaun and his court member indeed they are lawless people
Al-Qasas,14,-0.9246,0.53,0.47,0.0,he submitted my lord killed soul among them and fear they will kill me
Al-Qasas,34,0.0258,0.139,0.72,0.141,and my brother haroon he is more eloquent than am in speech therefore in order to help me appoint him a noble messenger so that he confirms me fear that they will deny me
Al-Qasas,40,-0.1027,0.078,0.83,0.092,he said we will soon strengthen your arm with your brother and give you both dominance so they will not be able to harm you due to our sign you both and those who will follow you will be victorious
Al-Qasas,28,-0.218,0.087,0.853,0.059,therefore when moosa came to them with our clear sign they said this is nothing but invented magic and we never heard anything like this among our forefather
Al-Qasas,29,-0.4211,0.176,0.698,0.126,and said moosa my lord well know him who ha brought guidance from him and for whom will be the abode the hereafter indeed the unjust never attain success
Al-Qasas,45,-0.0258,0.067,0.848,0.085,and firaun said court member do not know of any other god for you except myself therefore haman build lofty palace for me by baking concrete in order that may sneak look at the god of moosa and according to me he is indeed liar
Al-Qasas,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he and his soldier wrongfully sought greatness in the land and assumed they would never be brought back to u
Al-Qasas,22,-0.5106,0.136,0.864,0.0,we therefore seized him and his army and hurled them into the sea therefore see what sort of fate befell the unjust
Al-Qasas,25,-0.6908,0.224,0.703,0.073,and we made them leader of the people of hell inviting towards the fire and they will not be helped on the day of resurrection
Al-Qasas,19,-0.836,0.317,0.683,0.0,and we set curse after them in this world and evil is for them on the day of resurrection
Al-Qasas,27,0.2263,0.099,0.743,0.158,and we indeed gave moosa the book after we had destroyed the former generation having enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for them to accept advice
Al-Qasas,46,0.9061,0.0,0.774,0.226,and you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him were not on the western side of the mount when we sent the command of prophethood to moosa and you were not present yet you narrate the account very clearly to the jew and christian
Al-Qasas,34,0.6028,0.029,0.836,0.135,however we created generation and age passed by upon them and nor were you dwelling with the people of madyan reciting our verse to them however it is we who made the noble messenger
Al-Qasas,49,0.4215,0.106,0.757,0.137,and nor were you beside the mount when we proclaimed however it is mercy from your lord so that you may warn nation towards whom no herald of warning came before you in the hope of their heeding advice that he ha bestowed knowledge of the hidden to you
Al-Qasas,39,0.1331,0.138,0.692,0.17,otherwise if some disaster befell them because of what their own hand have sent forward they would say our lord why did you not send noble messenger towards u so we may have followed your sign and accepted faith
Al-Qasas,59,0.9035,0.032,0.758,0.209,so when the truth from u came to them they said why ha he not been given what wa given to moosa had they not disbelieved in what wa earlier given to moosa they said they are two magician who support each other and said we disbelieve in both of them prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him
Al-Qasas,29,0.9349,0.0,0.612,0.388,proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him therefore bring book from allah which is better guiding than these two will follow it if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,40,0.6904,0.073,0.753,0.174,so if they do not accept your challenge then know that they only follow their desire and who is more astray than one who follows his desire away from the guidance of allah indeed allah doe not guide the unjust
Al-Qasas,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we indeed sent down the word continuously for them so that they may ponder
Al-Qasas,18,0.6597,0.0,0.748,0.252,those to whom we gave the book before it accept faith in it some scholar among jew christian
Al-Qasas,31,0.7717,0.0,0.784,0.216,and when these verse are recited to them they say we accept faith in it indeed it is the truth from our lord and indeed we had surrendered even before this
Al-Qasas,27,0.296,0.126,0.686,0.189,they will be given double the reward the recompense of their patience and they repel evil with good and spend part of what we have provided them
Al-Qasas,35,0.1386,0.162,0.686,0.151,and when they hear indecent speech they ignore it and say for u are our deed and for you are your deed peace be to you good bye we are not interested in the ignorant

Yaseen,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,and whomever we bring to an old age we reverse him in creation so do they not understand
Yaseen,33,0.802,0.0,0.785,0.215,and we have not taught him prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him to recite poetry nor doe it befit him it is nothing but an advice and the bright qur an
Yaseen,20,0.296,0.064,0.818,0.118,to warn the living and to prove the word against disbeliever only the believer are deemed alive in allah sight
Yaseen,19,0.25,0.0,0.9,0.1,did they not see that we have created animal for them from our handiwork so they are their owner
Yaseen,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and have subjected the animal for them so they ride some animal and eat some
Yaseen,18,0.1331,0.115,0.745,0.14,and for them in the animal are numerous different benefit and drink so will they not be grateful
Yaseen,14,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,and they have appointed god other than allah that perhaps they may be helped
Yaseen,18,-0.0408,0.123,0.763,0.114,they the appointed god cannot help them and they and their army will come to u a captive
Yaseen,30,0.8881,0.0,0.694,0.306,therefore dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him do not grieve because of what they the disbeliever say indeed we know what they conceal and what they disclose
Yaseen,20,-0.0258,0.095,0.814,0.09,and did not man see that we have created him from drop of semen yet he is an open quarreller
Yaseen,27,0.5423,0.0,0.842,0.158,and he invents an example for u while forgetting his own creation saying who is such that can revive the bone when they have completely rotted away
Yaseen,32,0.9081,0.0,0.668,0.332,proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him they will be revived by the one who created them the first time and he is the all knowing of every creation
Yaseen,17,0.25,0.115,0.673,0.212,the one who ha created for you fire from the green tree so you kindle from it
Yaseen,38,0.9423,0.0,0.654,0.346,and is it not possible for the one who created the heaven and the earth to create the like of them it is surely possible why not and he is the great creator the all knowing of everything
Yaseen,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and his only task when he intends thing is to command it be and it thereupon happens
Yaseen,30,0.4939,0.0,0.897,0.103,therefore purity is to him in whose hand is the control over all thing and it is towards him that you will be returned used a metaphor to mean power

As-Saaffaat,17,-0.4404,0.198,0.691,0.111,when we are dead and have turned into dust and bone will we certainly be raised again

As-Saaffaat,16,-0.4215,0.157,0.843,0.0,and we did not have any control over you but in fact you yourselves were rebellious
As-Saaffaat,19,0.5994,0.126,0.553,0.32,so the word of our lord ha proved true upon u we will surely have to taste the punishment
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we therefore led you astray for we ourselves were astray
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.4939,0.262,0.738,0.0,so this day they all are partner in the punishment
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.4215,0.286,0.714,0.0,this is how we deal with the guilty
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.0258,0.12,0.765,0.115,indeed when it wa said to them there is no god except allah they were haughty
As-Saaffaat,16,-0.2732,0.166,0.725,0.109,and they used to say shall we forsake our god upon the saying of mad poet
As-Saaffaat,13,0.7717,0.0,0.565,0.435,in fact he ha brought the truth and testified for the noble messenger
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.4939,0.436,0.357,0.207,you surely have to taste the painful punishment
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and you will not be compensated except for your deed
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except the chosen bondman of allah
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for them is the sustenance known to u
As-Saaffaat,6,0.4939,0.0,0.61,0.39,fruit and they will be honoured
As-Saaffaat,4,0.5423,0.0,0.462,0.538,in garden of peace
As-Saaffaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,facing one another on throne
As-Saaffaat,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,cup of wine will be presented to them in round from spring flowing in front of them
As-Saaffaat,5,0.5719,0.0,0.519,0.481,white delicious for the drinker
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,neither doe it intoxicate nor give headache
As-Saaffaat,20,0.6124,0.0,0.826,0.174,and with them are those who do not set gaze upon men except their husband the maiden with gorgeous eye
As-Saaffaat,7,0.4939,0.0,0.61,0.39,a if they were egg safely hidden
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.1027,0.149,0.851,0.0,so one among them turn to the other questioning
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the speaker among them said had companion
As-Saaffaat,11,0.4215,0.0,0.781,0.219,who used to tell me do you believe it is true
As-Saaffaat,20,-0.6249,0.265,0.618,0.116,that when we are dead and have turned into dust and bone that we will either be rewarded or punished
As-Saaffaat,14,-0.6808,0.261,0.739,0.0,he said to others on the throne will you take glimpse into hell below
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.34,0.194,0.806,0.0,he therefore looked down and saw him amidst the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.4767,0.279,0.721,0.0,he said by allah you had nearly ruined me
As-Saaffaat,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and were it not for the munificence of my lord too would have been seized and brought forth captive
As-Saaffaat,22,0.9051,0.0,0.628,0.372,so are we never to die the people of paradise will ask the angel with delight after the announcement of everlasting life
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.7845,0.463,0.537,0.0,except our earlier death and nor will we be punished
As-Saaffaat,7,0.8822,0.0,0.281,0.719,this is most certainly the supreme success
As-Saaffaat,7,0.5719,0.0,0.619,0.381,for such reward should the worker perform
As-Saaffaat,10,0.7737,0.0,0.543,0.457,so is this welcome better or the tree of zaqqum
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.7579,0.481,0.519,0.0,we have indeed made that punishment for the unjust
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.6808,0.315,0.685,0.0,indeed it is tree that sprout from the base of hell
As-Saaffaat,7,0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294,it fruit like the head of demon
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so indeed they will eat from it and fill their belly with it
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then after it indeed for them is the drink of boiling hot water
As-Saaffaat,7,-0.4019,0.368,0.4,0.232,then surely their return is towards hell
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they had indeed found their forefather astray
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they hastily follow their footstep
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed before them most of the former people went astray
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.34,0.211,0.789,0.0,and indeed we had sent herald of warning among them
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.2732,0.174,0.826,0.0,therefore see what sort of fate befell those who were warned
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except the chosen bondman of allah
As-Saaffaat,15,0.6077,0.0,0.766,0.234,and indeed nooh prayed to u so what an excellent acceptor of prayer we are
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7845,0.0,0.566,0.434,and we rescued him and his household from the great calamity
As-Saaffaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we preserved his descendant
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,and we kept his praise among the latter generation
As-Saaffaat,8,0.5423,0.0,0.667,0.333,peace be upon nooh among the entire people
As-Saaffaat,7,0.7964,0.0,0.413,0.587,this is how we reward the virtuous
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondman
As-Saaffaat,5,-0.5994,0.494,0.506,0.0,we then drowned the others
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed ibrahim is from his nooh group
As-Saaffaat,12,0.5106,0.0,0.769,0.231,when he came to his lord with sound heart free from falsehood
As-Saaffaat,15,0.296,0.0,0.864,0.136,when he said to his father paternal uncle and his people what do you worship
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5859,0.0,0.593,0.407,what you desire through fabrication god other than allah
As-Saaffaat,17,0.5962,0.0,0.755,0.245,so what do you assume regarding the lord of the creation that he will not punish you
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he then shot glance at the star
As-Saaffaat,7,-0.5106,0.355,0.645,0.0,he then said feel sick of you
As-Saaffaat,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they turned their back on him and went away the pagan thought he would transmit the disease
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he then sneaked upon their deity and said do you not eat
As-Saaffaat,12,0.0258,0.0,0.909,0.091,what is the matter with you that you do not say anything
As-Saaffaat,13,0.4939,0.0,0.789,0.211,he then began striking them with his right hand unseen by the people
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the disbeliever came running towards him
As-Saaffaat,10,0.296,0.0,0.804,0.196,he said what you worship what you yourselves have sculpted
As-Saaffaat,8,0.5267,0.0,0.577,0.423,whereas allah ha created you and your action
As-Saaffaat,15,-0.34,0.146,0.854,0.0,they said construct building furnace for him and then cast him in the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,24,-0.6705,0.285,0.564,0.151,so they tried to execute their evil scheme upon him we therefore degraded them allah saved him by commanding the fire to turn cool
As-Saaffaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he said indeed shall go to my lord who will guide me
As-Saaffaat,6,0.4767,0.0,0.617,0.383,my lord give me meritorious child
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7184,0.0,0.6,0.4,we therefore gave him the glad tidings of an intelligent son
As-Saaffaat,43,0.3818,0.0,0.942,0.058,and when he became capable of working with him ibrahim said my son dreamt that am sacrificing you therefore now consider what is your opinion he said my father do what you are commanded allah willing you will soon find me patiently enduring
As-Saaffaat,22,0.4168,0.0,0.883,0.117,then remember when they both submitted to allah command and ibrahim lay his son facing downwards the knife did not hurt ismail
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we called out to him ibrahim
As-Saaffaat,16,0.8979,0.0,0.502,0.498,you have indeed made the dream come true and this is how we reward the virtuous
As-Saaffaat,5,0.3818,0.0,0.606,0.394,indeed this wa clear test
As-Saaffaat,27,0.886,0.0,0.698,0.302,and we rescued him in exchange of great sacrifice the sacrifice of ibrahim and ismail peace be upon them is commemorated every year on and zil haj
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,and we kept his praise among the latter generation
As-Saaffaat,4,0.5423,0.0,0.462,0.538,peace be upon ibrahim
As-Saaffaat,7,0.7964,0.0,0.413,0.587,this is how we reward the virtuous
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondman
As-Saaffaat,20,0.4588,0.0,0.864,0.136,and we gave him the glad tidings of ishaq herald of the hidden from among those who deserve our proximity
As-Saaffaat,23,0.6908,0.1,0.615,0.285,and we sent blessing upon him and ishaq and among their descendant some who do good deed and some who clearly wrong themselves
As-Saaffaat,10,0.7906,0.0,0.533,0.467,and we indeed did great favour to moosa and haroon
As-Saaffaat,10,0.7845,0.0,0.537,0.463,and rescued them and their people from the great calamity
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we helped them so they were victorious
As-Saaffaat,10,0.3818,0.0,0.776,0.224,and we bestowed the clear book to both of them
As-Saaffaat,7,0.2263,0.0,0.759,0.241,and guided them to the straight path
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,and we kept their praise among the latter generation
As-Saaffaat,6,0.5423,0.0,0.588,0.412,peace be upon moosa and haroon
As-Saaffaat,7,0.7964,0.0,0.413,0.587,this is how we reward the virtuous
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed they are two of our high ranking firmly believing bondman
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4588,0.0,0.727,0.273,and indeed ilyas is one of the noble messenger
As-Saaffaat,10,0.3875,0.0,0.774,0.226,when he said to his people do you not fear
As-Saaffaat,11,0.7351,0.077,0.513,0.41,what you worship baal an idol and leave the best creator
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah who is your lord and the lord of your forefather
As-Saaffaat,14,0.0679,0.17,0.645,0.185,in response they denied him so they will surely be brought forth a captive
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except the chosen bondman of allah
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,and we kept his praise among the latter generation
As-Saaffaat,4,0.5423,0.0,0.462,0.538,peace be upon ilyas
As-Saaffaat,7,0.7964,0.0,0.413,0.587,this is how we reward the virtuous

As-Saaffaat,9,0.4588,0.0,0.727,0.273,and indeed lut is one of the noble messenger
As-Saaffaat,8,0.4215,0.0,0.714,0.286,when we rescued him and his entire household
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except an old woman who became of those who stayed behind
As-Saaffaat,5,-0.4939,0.444,0.556,0.0,we then destroyed the others
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed you pas over them in the morning
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and during the night so do you not have sense
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4588,0.0,0.727,0.273,and indeed yunus is one of the noble messenger
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when he left towards the laden ship
As-Saaffaat,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then lot were drawn and he became of those who were pushed into the sea
As-Saaffaat,15,-0.4767,0.181,0.819,0.0,the fish then swallowed him and he blamed himself for not waiting for allah command
As-Saaffaat,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,and were he not one of those who praise
As-Saaffaat,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he would have remained in it belly till the day when all will be raised
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.5106,0.248,0.752,0.0,we then put him ashore on plain and he wa sick
As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we grew tree of gourd a shelter above him
As-Saaffaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent him towards hundred thousand people in fact more
As-Saaffaat,11,0.6643,0.0,0.623,0.377,so they accepted faith we therefore gave them usage for while
As-Saaffaat,24,0.8519,0.0,0.693,0.307,therefore ask them dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him whether the daughter are for your lord and the son for them
As-Saaffaat,13,0.25,0.0,0.846,0.154,or that have we created the angel a female while they were present
As-Saaffaat,9,-0.1027,0.149,0.851,0.0,pay heed it is their slander that they say
As-Saaffaat,10,0.25,0.212,0.449,0.34,that allah ha offspring and indeed surely they are liar
As-Saaffaat,7,0.34,0.0,0.714,0.286,ha he chosen daughter instead of son
As-Saaffaat,12,-0.2732,0.165,0.752,0.083,what is the matter with you what sort of judgement you impose
As-Saaffaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so do you not ponder
As-Saaffaat,7,0.3818,0.0,0.698,0.302,or do you have some clear proof
As-Saaffaat,9,0.4588,0.0,0.727,0.273,then bring forth your book if you are truthful
As-Saaffaat,22,0.4404,0.0,0.879,0.121,and they have appointed relationship between him and the jinns and indeed the jinns surely know that they will be brought forth
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0258,0.0,0.879,0.121,purity is to allah from the matter they fabricate
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,except the chosen bondman of allah
As-Saaffaat,12,0.296,0.0,0.833,0.167,therefore you and all what you worship the disbeliever and their deity
As-Saaffaat,7,0.1139,0.0,0.806,0.194,you cannot make anyone rebel against him
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.34,0.211,0.789,0.0,except the one who will go into the blazing fire
As-Saaffaat,13,0.34,0.0,0.821,0.179,and the angel say each one of u ha an appointed known position
As-Saaffaat,10,0.1027,0.0,0.865,0.135,and indeed we with our wing spread await the command
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed we are those who say his purity
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed the disbeliever used to say
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if we had some advice from the earlier generation
As-Saaffaat,9,0.34,0.0,0.769,0.231,we would certainly be the chosen bondman of allah
As-Saaffaat,11,-0.4404,0.225,0.775,0.0,they therefore denied it so they will soon come to know
As-Saaffaat,14,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,and indeed our word ha already gone forth for our bondman who were sent
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that undoubtedly only they will be helped
As-Saaffaat,8,0.4404,0.0,0.707,0.293,and surely only our army will be victorious
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore turn away from them for some time
As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and watch them for they will soon see
As-Saaffaat,8,-0.6597,0.474,0.526,0.0,so are they being impatient for our punishment

As-Saaffaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and turn away from them for some time
As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and wait for they will soon see

As-Saaffaat,11,0.6908,0.0,0.612,0.388,and all praise is to allah the lord of the creation
Saad,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,saad by oath of the renowned qur an alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
Saad,10,0.34,0.0,0.789,0.211,in fact the disbeliever are in false pride and opposition
Saad,19,-0.6597,0.256,0.672,0.071,many generation we did destroy before them thereupon they cried out whereas it is not the time to escape
Saad,23,0.0772,0.186,0.619,0.195,and they were surprised that herald of warning came to them from among themselves and the disbeliever said he is magician great liar
Saad,15,0.5012,0.118,0.551,0.331,ha he made all the god into one god this is really something very strange
Saad,20,0.5106,0.053,0.749,0.198,and their leader went about leave him and cling steadfastly to your god indeed he ha hidden objective in this
Saad,17,0.4215,0.0,0.798,0.202,we never heard of this even in christianity the latest religion this is clearly newly fabricated matter
Saad,29,-0.6908,0.18,0.82,0.0,is the qur an which is sent to him among u in fact they are in doubt concerning my book in fact they have not yet tasted my punishment
Saad,17,0.8316,0.0,0.614,0.386,or do they hold the treasure of the mercy of your lord the almighty the great bestower
Saad,25,0.5106,0.0,0.879,0.121,is the kingdom of the heaven and the earth and all that is between them for them so would they not just ascend using rope
Saad,15,-0.4588,0.176,0.824,0.0,this is just one of the disgraced army that will be routed there and then
Saad,19,-0.4404,0.139,0.861,0.0,before them the people of nooh had denied and the tribe of ad and firaun who used to crucify
Saad,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the tribe of thamud and the people of lut and the people of the wood these are the group
Saad,18,-0.5638,0.25,0.66,0.09,none of them wa such that it did not deny the noble messenger therefore my punishment became inevitable
Saad,10,-0.6369,0.471,0.429,0.1,they await just one scream which no one can avert
Saad,15,0.296,0.0,0.855,0.145,and they said our lord give u our share quickly before the day of reckoning
Saad,24,0.7783,0.0,0.764,0.236,have patience upon what they say and remember our bondman dawud the one blessed with favour he is indeed most inclined towards his lord
Saad,16,0.5574,0.0,0.806,0.194,indeed we subjected the hill to say the praise with him at night and at morn
Saad,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and bird gathered together they were all obedient to him
Saad,12,0.7351,0.0,0.617,0.383,and we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and just speech
Saad,19,0.0258,0.0,0.942,0.058,and did the news of the two disputant reach you when they scaled over the wall into dawud mosque
Saad,41,-0.3292,0.137,0.754,0.108,when they entered upon david so he feared them they said do not fear we are two disputant one of whom ha wronged the other therefore judge fairly between u and do not judge unjustly and show u the right way
Saad,30,0.0534,0.067,0.859,0.074,this is my brother he ha ninety nine ewe and have one ewe and he now say give that one also to me and he is very demanding in speech
Saad,66,-0.4432,0.11,0.819,0.071,said dawud he is indeed being unjust to you in that he demand to add your ewe to his ewe and indeed most partner wrong one another except those who believe and do good deed and they are very few thereupon dawud realised that we had tested him so he sought forgiveness from his lord and fell prostrate and inclined towards his lord command of prostration

Az-Zukhruf,36,0.6801,0.036,0.812,0.152,and they appoint the angel who are the bondman of the most gracious a female were they present at the time of the angel creation their declaration will be now recorded and they will be questioned
Az-Zukhruf,27,-0.0173,0.151,0.731,0.118,and they say if the most gracious had willed we would not have worshipped them they do not know it truth at all they only make guess

Az-Zukhruf,38,0.8555,0.051,0.699,0.25,and similarly whenever we sent herald of warning before you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him into any town it wealthy people said we found our forefather upon religion and we are behind their footstep

Az-Zukhruf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and ibrahim kept this declaration among his progeny in order that they may desist
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.7906,0.0,0.75,0.25,in fact gave them and their forefather the usage of this world until the truth and the noble messenger who conveyed the message clearly came to them
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.0258,0.113,0.769,0.118,and when the truth came to them they said this is magic and we disbelieve in it
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.6249,0.0,0.854,0.146,and they said why wa the qur an not sent down upon some chieftain of these two great town the chief of mecca and taif
Az-Zukhruf,49,0.7458,0.053,0.766,0.181,are they the distributor of your lord mercy we have distributed among them their comfort in the life of this world and gave high status to some over others so that they mock at each other and the mercy of your lord is better than all what they hoard
Az-Zukhruf,32,0.5984,0.0,0.888,0.112,and were it not for that all people be on one religion we would have made for the disbeliever of the most gracious roof and stair of silver which they would climb
Az-Zukhruf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and door of silver for their house and couch of silver upon which they would recline
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.3182,0.0,0.913,0.087,and diverse adornment and all this is usage only of the life of this world and the hereafter with your lord is for the pious
Az-Zukhruf,20,-0.1298,0.167,0.685,0.148,and whoever is averse to the remembrance of the most gracious we appoint devil upon him who stay with him
Az-Zukhruf,17,-0.5267,0.206,0.654,0.14,and indeed those devil prevent them from the straight path and they think they are on guidance
Az-Zukhruf,52,-0.8768,0.156,0.844,0.0,to the extent that when the disbeliever will be brought to u he will say to his devil ala if only there wa the distance of east and west between you and me so what an evil companion he is had not listened to you they will be bound together in chain
Az-Zukhruf,27,-0.8393,0.272,0.728,0.0,it will be said to them and you will not benefit from them this day whereas you are unjust for you are all partner in the punishment
Az-Zukhruf,35,-0.7003,0.196,0.749,0.056,so will you make the deaf listen or show the path to the blind and to those who are in open error the disbeliever whose heart are sealed are deaf and blind to the truth
Az-Zukhruf,14,-0.5267,0.207,0.793,0.0,so if we take you away we shall then indeed take revenge from them
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,or show you what we have promised them we therefore have complete control over them
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.7003,0.0,0.799,0.201,therefore hold fast to what we have divinely revealed to you indeed you are upon the straight path the holy prophet can never go astray
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.5106,0.07,0.746,0.184,and it is undoubtedly an honour for you and your people and you will soon be questioned
Az-Zukhruf,26,0.8805,0.0,0.663,0.337,and ask them did any of the noble messenger we sent before you appoint any other god except the most gracious whom they used to worship
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.6249,0.0,0.831,0.169,and indeed we sent moosa along with our sign towards firaun and his chieftain he therefore said indeed am noble messenger of the lord of the creation
Az-Zukhruf,13,-0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,so when he brought our sign to them they started mocking at them
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.3612,0.0,0.906,0.094,and all the sign we showed them were always greater than the earlier one and we seized them with calamity so that they may return
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.5719,0.0,0.836,0.164,and they said you magician pray for u to your lord by the mean of his covenant which is with you we will certainly come to guidance
Az-Zukhruf,13,-0.2648,0.262,0.6,0.138,so when we averted the calamity from them they immediately broke the promise
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and said firaun my people is not the kingdom of egypt for me and these river that flow beneath me so do you not see
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.2263,0.096,0.766,0.139,or that am better than him for he is lowly and he doe not seem to talk plainly
Az-Zukhruf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so why wa he not bestowed with armlet of gold or angel should have come with him staying at his side
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so when he had brainwashed his people they followed him indeed they were disobedient nation
Az-Zukhruf,17,-0.9001,0.458,0.542,0.0,so when they made u wrathful we took revenge from them we therefore drowned all of them
Az-Zukhruf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so we made them bygone fable and lesson for the latter generation
Az-Zukhruf,16,0.5574,0.0,0.806,0.194,and when the example of the son of maryam is given your people laugh at it
Az-Zukhruf,26,0.128,0.082,0.819,0.099,and they say are our deity better or he they did not say this to you except to unjustly argue in fact they are quarrelsome people
Az-Zukhruf,23,0.4215,0.0,0.887,0.113,he is purely bondman of ours whom we have favoured upon and we made him an extraordinary example for the descendant of israel
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if we willed we could have established angel on the earth instead of you

Al-Jaathiyah,21,0.8979,0.0,0.554,0.446,so those who believed and did good deed their lord will admit them into his mercy this is the clear triumph
Al-Jaathiyah,28,-0.4215,0.094,0.906,0.0,and to those who disbelieved it will be said wa it not that our verse were recited to you in response you were haughty and were guilty people
Al-Jaathiyah,45,-0.2163,0.134,0.768,0.098,and when it wa said indeed allah promise is true and there is no doubt regarding the last day you used to say we do not know what the last day is we think it is nothing except an imagination and we are not convinced
Al-Jaathiyah,19,-0.886,0.394,0.606,0.0,and the evil of their deed appeared to them and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
Al-Jaathiyah,36,-0.6921,0.194,0.806,0.0,and it will be said this day we shall forsake you the way you had forgotten the confronting of this day of yours and your destination is the fire and you do not have any supporter

Al-Ahqaaf,36,0.5267,0.0,0.885,0.115,and who is more astray than one who worship those instead of allah who cannot listen to their prayer until the day of resurrection and who do not even know of their worship will never listen
Al-Ahqaaf,26,-0.6808,0.201,0.747,0.052,and on the day when people are gathered they will become their enemy and will reject their worshipper the idol will give testimony against the polytheist
Al-Ahqaaf,25,0.743,0.0,0.751,0.249,and when our clear verse are recited to them the disbeliever say regarding the truth that ha come to them this is an obvious magic

Al-Ahqaaf,45,0.6488,0.113,0.663,0.223,say what is your opinion if the qur an is from allah and you have rejected faith in it and witness among the descendant of israel ha already testified upon this and accepted faith while you became arrogant indeed allah doe not guide the unjust
Al-Ahqaaf,42,0.4404,0.0,0.932,0.068,and the disbeliever said regarding the muslim if there were any good in it the muslim would not have surpassed u in achieving it and since they did not receive guidance with it they will now say this is an old slander
Al-Ahqaaf,34,0.765,0.107,0.636,0.257,and whereas before this exists the book of moosa guide and mercy and this is book giving testimony in the arabic language to warn the unjust and to give glad tidings to the virtuous
Al-Ahqaaf,22,0.7015,0.0,0.736,0.264,indeed those who said allah is our lord and then remained steadfast upon them is neither any fear nor shall they grieve
Al-Ahqaaf,15,0.836,0.0,0.622,0.378,they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the reward of their deed

Al-Ahqaaf,64,0.886,0.041,0.754,0.205,and the one who said to his parent uff am fed up with both of you what you promise me that will be raised again whereas generation have passed away before me and they both seek allah help and say to him may you be ruined accept faith indeed allah promise is true he therefore answer this is nothing except story of former people
Al-Ahqaaf,26,0.2023,0.108,0.728,0.165,it is these upon whom the word ha proved true among the nation that passed away before them of jinns and men indeed they were loser
Al-Ahqaaf,28,0.3412,0.0,0.918,0.082,and for all person are rank according to their deed and so that he may repay them in full for their deed and they will not be wronged
Al-Ahqaaf,64,-0.3818,0.119,0.797,0.084,and on the day when the disbeliever will be presented upon the fire it will be said to them you have wasted your portion of the good thing in the life of this world and enjoyed them so this day you will be repaid with the disgraceful punishment the recompense of your wrongfully priding yourself in the land and because you used to disobey
Al-Ahqaaf,48,-0.7709,0.217,0.713,0.07,and remember the fellowman of the tribe of ad when he warned his nation in the ahqaf and indeed herald of warning passed away before and after him that do not worship anyone except allah indeed fear the punishment of great day upon you country among sand dune
Al-Ahqaaf,28,0.7506,0.0,0.739,0.261,they said have you come to u in order to turn u away from our god therefore bring upon u what you promise u if you are truthful
Al-Ahqaaf,25,-0.3919,0.099,0.901,0.0,he said it knowledge is only with allah and convey to you the message of my lord but perceive that you are an ignorant nation
Al-Ahqaaf,43,-0.8402,0.225,0.725,0.049,so when they saw the punishment coming towards their valley spread like cloud on the horizon they said that is cloud which will shower rain upon u said hud in fact this is what you were being impatient for windstorm carrying painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,33,-0.8932,0.287,0.713,0.0,that destroys all thing by the command of it lord so at morning none could be seen except their empty house this is the sort of punishment we mete out to the guilty
Al-Ahqaaf,55,-0.8714,0.176,0.824,0.0,and we had indeed given them the mean which we have not given you and made ear and eye and heart for them so their ear and eye and heart did not benefit them at all because they used to deny the sign of allah and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
Al-Ahqaaf,16,-0.4939,0.176,0.824,0.0,and we indeed destroyed township surrounding you and brought several sign so that they may desist
Al-Ahqaaf,35,-0.3523,0.124,0.818,0.057,so why did they the one whom they had chosen a god a mean of attaining allah proximity not help them in fact the disbeliever lost them and this is just their slander and fabrication
Al-Ahqaaf,51,0.8625,0.04,0.745,0.215,and when we sent number of jinns towards you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him listening attentively to the qur an so when they presented themselves there they said to each other listen quietly and when the recitation finished they turned back to their people giving them warning
Al-Ahqaaf,28,0.4939,0.0,0.861,0.139,they said our people we have indeed heard book sent down after moosa which confirms the book preceding it and guide towards the truth and the straight path
Al-Ahqaaf,28,-0.0,0.234,0.507,0.258,our people listen to allah caller and accept faith in him so that he may forgive you some of your sin and save you from the painful punishment
Al-Ahqaaf,25,-0.2306,0.208,0.647,0.146,and whoever doe not listen to allah caller cannot escape in the earth and he ha no supporter against allah they are in open error
Al-Ahqaaf,39,0.498,0.157,0.623,0.22,have they not realised that allah who did not tire in creating the heaven and the earth and in creating them is able to revive the dead surely yes why not indeed he is able to do all thing
Al-Ahqaaf,45,0.0,0.107,0.785,0.107,and on the day when the disbeliever are presented upon the fire it will be said is this not reality they will answer by oath of our lord surely yes why not it will be said therefore taste the punishment the recompense of your disbelief
Al-Ahqaaf,63,0.9544,0.041,0.673,0.287,therefore patiently endure dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him like the courageous noble messenger had endured and do not be impatient for them on the day when they see what they are promised it will be a if they had not stayed on earth except part of day this is to be conveyed will anyone be destroyed except the disobedient
Muhammad,14,-0.1779,0.181,0.621,0.198,allah ha destroyed the deed of those who disbelieved and prevented from allah way
Muhammad,46,0.9501,0.068,0.557,0.375,and those who accepted faith and did good deed and believed in what ha been sent down upon mohammed peace and blessing be upon him and that is the truth from their lord allah ha relieved them of some of their evil and refined their condition
Muhammad,29,0.3182,0.0,0.924,0.076,this is because the disbeliever followed falsehood and the believer followed the truth which is from their lord this is how allah illustrates the example of people to them
Muhammad,83,-0.5905,0.141,0.767,0.091,so when you confront the disbeliever strike at their neck until when you have slain them in plenty tie them up firmly then after that you may either release them a favour or take ransom until the war lay down it ordeal this is it and had allah willed he himself could have taken revenge from them but this is to test some of you with others and allah will surely never waste the deed of those who were killed in his way
Muhammad,11,0.8126,0.0,0.549,0.451,he will soon guide them towards paradise and make them succeed
Muhammad,14,0.7184,0.0,0.667,0.333,and he will admit them into paradise they have been made familiar with it
Muhammad,18,0.6597,0.0,0.748,0.252,people who believe if you help the religion of allah he will help you and will stabilise you
Muhammad,16,-0.8316,0.404,0.596,0.0,and for those who disbelieve may they be ruined and may allah destroy all their deed
Muhammad,17,0.2732,0.126,0.651,0.223,this is because they disliked what allah ha sent down he ha therefore squandered all their deed
Muhammad,32,-0.3182,0.105,0.826,0.069,so did they not travel in the land to see what sort of fate befell those who preceded them allah poured ruin upon them and for the disbeliever are several like it
Muhammad,18,0.4939,0.0,0.792,0.208,this is because allah is the supporter of the believer whereas the disbeliever do not have any supporter
Muhammad,35,0.7906,0.056,0.701,0.243,allah will indeed admit those who believed and did good deed into garden beneath which river flow and the disbeliever enjoy and they eat like the cattle eat and their destination is in the fire
Muhammad,35,0.7837,0.109,0.632,0.259,and many township existed which wa stronger than your town dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him those who removed you from your town we destroyed them so they do not have supporter
Muhammad,34,0.6486,0.1,0.658,0.243,so will one who is upon on clear proof from his lord ever be like any of those whose evil deed are made to appear good to them and they follow their own desire
Muhammad,92,0.9001,0.023,0.837,0.14,description of the garden which is promised to the pious in it are river of water which shall never pollute and river of milk the taste of which shall never change and river of wine delicious to drink and river of purified honey and in it for them are fruit of all kind and the forgiveness of their lord so will such ever be equal to those who are to stay in the fire for ever and who will be given boiling water to drink so that it tear their gut apart
Muhammad,46,0.6249,0.0,0.896,0.104,and among them are some who listen to what you say until when they go away from you they say to those who have been given knowledge what did he say now they are those whose heart allah ha sealed and they follow their own desire
Muhammad,19,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,and those who attained the right path allah increase the guidance for them and bestows their piety to them
Muhammad,33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so what are they waiting for except that the last day suddenly come upon them for it sign have already appeared so when it doe come of what use is their realising it
Muhammad,52,0.5432,0.123,0.7,0.177,therefore know dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him that there is none worthy of worship except allah and seek the forgiveness of sin of your close one and for the common believing men and woman and allah know your movement during the day and your resting during the night
Muhammad,49,0.2911,0.098,0.784,0.118,and the muslim say why wa not chapter sent down so when positive chapter wa sent down and war wa commanded in it you will see those in whose heart is disease looking at you with the dazed look of dying man so it would be better for them
Muhammad,25,0.8271,0.0,0.717,0.283,to obey and speak good so when the manifest command came it would have been better for them if they had remained faithful to allah
Muhammad,22,-0.5719,0.15,0.85,0.0,so do you portray that if you get governance you would spread chaos in the land and sever your relation the hypocrite
Muhammad,19,0.5719,0.0,0.783,0.217,it is these whom allah ha cursed so he made them deaf to the truth and blinded their eye
Muhammad,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so do they not ponder the qur an deeply or are there lock on some of their heart
Muhammad,25,0.5267,0.093,0.673,0.234,indeed those who turn back after the guidance had become clear to them satan ha deceived them and made them optimistic of living for age
Muhammad,32,-0.4019,0.142,0.763,0.095,this is because they said to those who dislike what allah ha sent down we will obey you regarding one matter and allah know their secret to fight against the holy prophet
Muhammad,19,-0.4902,0.15,0.85,0.0,so how dreadful will it be when the angel remove their soul striking at their face and their back
Muhammad,23,-0.3818,0.109,0.847,0.044,this is because they followed the matter which displeases allah and they disliked what plea him he therefore squandered away all their deed
Muhammad,16,0.1139,0.0,0.912,0.088,what do they in whose heart is disease fancy that allah will not expose concealed enmity
Muhammad,35,0.4404,0.0,0.921,0.079,and if we will we can show them to you so that you may recognise them by their face and you will surely recognise them by the way they talk and allah know your deed
Muhammad,22,0.25,0.0,0.913,0.087,and we shall indeed test you until we make known the warrior and the steadfast among you and to test your proclamation
Muhammad,38,0.8201,0.0,0.781,0.219,indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah way and opposed the noble messenger after the guidance had become clear to them they cannot harm allah in the least and soon he will squander away their deed
Muhammad,17,0.4588,0.0,0.842,0.158,people who believe obey allah and obey the noble messenger and do not render your deed void
Muhammad,21,-0.6501,0.23,0.723,0.047,indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah way and then died a disbeliever so allah will never forgive them
Muhammad,31,-0.2368,0.115,0.827,0.058,therefore do not relax nor call towards truce by yourself and it is you who will dominate and allah is with you and he will never cause loss in your deed
Muhammad,32,0.9062,0.0,0.695,0.305,the worldly life is just sport and pastime and if you accept faith and be pious he will bestow your reward to you and not at all ask you for your wealth
Muhammad,25,-0.765,0.257,0.743,0.0,were he to ask it from you and ask in plenty you would be miserly and the miserliness would expose the filth within your heart
Muhammad,63,-0.7105,0.165,0.764,0.071,yes undoubtedly it is you who are being called that you may spend in allah way so some among you act miserly and whoever is miserly is being miser upon himself and allah is the independent wealthy not requiring anything whereas you all are needy and if you renege he will replace you with other people and they will not be like you
Al-Fath,18,0.8979,0.0,0.541,0.459,we have indeed for your sake dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him bestowed clear victory
Al-Fath,31,0.3182,0.096,0.72,0.184,so that allah may forgive for your sake the sin of those before you and those after you and complete his favour upon you and to show you the straight path
Al-Fath,9,0.7783,0.0,0.507,0.493,and so that allah may provide you great help

Al-Fath,37,0.9042,0.0,0.73,0.27,in order to admit the believing men and believing woman into garden beneath which river flow in which they will abide and to relieve them of their misdeed and this in allah sight is the greatest success
Al-Fath,52,-0.9628,0.328,0.553,0.12,and to punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite woman and the polytheist men and polytheist woman who think evilly about allah upon them only is the evil cycle of misfortune and allah ha wreaked anger upon them and ha cursed them and ha prepared hell for them and what an evil destination

Al-Fath,51,0.9764,0.039,0.569,0.393,in order that you people may accept faith in allah and his noble messenger and honour and revere the noble messenger and may say the purity of allah morning and evening to honour the holy prophet peace and blessing be upon him is part of faith to disrespect him is blasphemy
Al-Fath,64,0.9844,0.028,0.585,0.387,those who swear allegiance to you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him do indeed in fact swear allegiance to allah allah hand of power is above their hand so whoever breach his oath ha breached his own greater promise and whoever fulfils the covenant he ha with allah so very soon allah will bestow upon him great reward used a metaphor
Al-Fath,72,0.4215,0.072,0.808,0.121,the ignorant one who had stayed behind will now say to you our wealth and our family prevented u from going by keeping u pre occupied therefore seek forgiveness for u they utter with their tongue what is not in their heart say so doe anyone have any control over you against allah if he will to harm you or provide you benefit in fact allah is aware of what you do
Al-Fath,39,-0.2789,0.157,0.71,0.133,rather you had assumed that the noble messenger and the muslim will never return to their home and you thought this a good within your heart whereas you had thought evilly and you were people about to be ruined
Al-Fath,21,-0.2537,0.249,0.575,0.176,and whoever doe not accept faith in allah and his noble messenger we have indeed kept prepared blazing fire for disbeliever

Al-Fath,60,-0.5023,0.084,0.886,0.03,those who had stayed behind will now say when you go to receive the war booty let u also go with you they wish to change the word of allah say you shall never come with u this is already decreed by allah so they will now say but rather you envy u in fact they never understood except little
Al-Fath,58,0.7096,0.143,0.662,0.195,say to the ignorant who stayed behind you will soon be called against nation of great military strength to fight against them or that they become muslim so if you obey allah will give you an excellent reward and if you turn away the way you had turned away before he will mete out painful punishment to you
Al-Fath,47,-0.9062,0.281,0.64,0.079,there is no reproach upon the blind nor reproach against the lame nor reproach upon the sick and whoever obeys allah and his noble messenger allah will admit him into garden beneath which river flow and whoever turn away he will mete out painful punishment to him
Al-Fath,39,0.91,0.0,0.737,0.263,indeed allah wa truly pleased with the believer when they swore allegiance to you beneath the tree so he knew what wa in their heart he therefore sent down peace upon them and rewarded them with an imminent victory
Al-Fath,13,0.4351,0.189,0.484,0.328,and plenty of war booty to take and allah is most honourable wise
Al-Fath,43,0.886,0.0,0.754,0.246,allah ha promised you plenty of booty which you will take and ha bestowed this to you quickly and restrained people hand from you and in order that it may be sign for the believer and to guide you on the straight path

Al-Fath,56,0.128,0.042,0.908,0.05,whereas the disbeliever had set up in their heart an obstinacy the same obstinacy of the day of ignorance so allah sent down his solace upon his noble messenger and upon the believer and decreed upon them the word of piety and they were more deserving and suitable for it and allah is the all knowing
Al-Fath,53,0.9511,0.031,0.655,0.313,allah ha indeed made the truthful dream of his noble messenger come true indeed you will all enter the sacred mosque if allah will in safety with your head shaven or hair cut short without fear so he know what you do not know and ha therefore ordained another imminent victory before this
Al-Fath,39,0.802,0.0,0.81,0.19,it is he who ha sent his noble messenger with the guidance and the true religion in order to make it prevail over all other religion and allah is sufficient a witness the holy prophet is light from allah

At-Toor,24,0.9118,0.0,0.613,0.387,therefore dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him enlighten for by the munificence of your lord you are neither soothsayer nor madman
At-Toor,15,0.1027,0.0,0.909,0.091,or they allege he is poet we await calamity of the time to befall him

At-Toor,15,0.0176,0.132,0.733,0.135,what they say he ha invented the qur an rather they do not have faith
At-Toor,12,0.6705,0.0,0.645,0.355,so let them bring single discourse like it if they are truthful
At-Toor,14,-0.1877,0.118,0.882,0.0,have they not been created from some source or are they themselves the creator
At-Toor,14,0.5553,0.1,0.604,0.296,or did they create the heaven and the earth rather they are not certain
At-Toor,14,0.3612,0.0,0.774,0.226,or do they have the treasure of your lord or are they the authority
At-Toor,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,or do they have any stair climbing upon which they eavesdrop so their eavesdropper should bring some clear proof

At-Toor,14,-0.7783,0.362,0.638,0.0,or are they planning conspiracy so the conspiracy will befall only upon the disbeliever
At-Toor,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,or do they have god besides allah purity is to allah from their ascribing of partner to him
At-Toor,18,-0.1531,0.086,0.914,0.0,and were they to see portion of the sky falling they will say it is heap of cloud
At-Toor,14,-0.3182,0.281,0.719,0.0,therefore leave them until they confront their day in which they will be stunned
At-Toor,16,-0.357,0.142,0.858,0.0,day on which their scheming will not benefit them at all nor will they be helped
At-Toor,26,-0.899,0.352,0.648,0.0,and indeed for the unjust is another punishment before this but most of them do not know punishment in the grave is proven by this verse
At-Toor,36,0.9153,0.0,0.714,0.286,and be patient upon your lord command dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him for you are indeed in our sight and proclaim the purity of your lord while praising him whenever you stand
At-Toor,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and proclaim his purity during the night and when the star turn back
An-Najm,20,0.875,0.0,0.63,0.37,by oath of the beloved shining star mohammed peace and blessing be upon him when he returned from the ascent
An-Najm,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,your companion did not err nor did he go astray
An-Najm,10,0.4019,0.0,0.769,0.231,and he doe not say anything by his own desire
An-Najm,10,0.7096,0.0,0.647,0.353,it is but divine revelation which is revealed to him
An-Najm,8,0.6697,0.0,0.522,0.478,he ha been taught by the extremely powerful
An-Najm,8,0.5106,0.0,0.68,0.32,the strong then the spectacle inclined towards him
An-Najm,10,0.5106,0.0,0.732,0.268,and he wa on the horizon of the highest heaven
An-Najm,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the spectacle became closer and came down in full view
An-Najm,34,0.9325,0.0,0.682,0.318,so the distance between the spectacle and the beloved wa only two arm length or even le the heavenly journey of prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him wa with body and soul
An-Najm,11,0.854,0.0,0.519,0.481,so allah divinely revealed to his bondman whatever he divinely revealed
An-Najm,20,0.2584,0.0,0.903,0.097,the heart did not deny what it saw the holy prophet wa bestowed with seeing allah see also preceding verse
An-Najm,11,-0.4522,0.229,0.771,0.0,what so do you dispute with him regarding what he saw
An-Najm,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed he did see the spectacle again
An-Najm,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,near the lote tree of the last boundary
An-Najm,7,0.6369,0.0,0.588,0.412,close to which is the everlasting paradise
An-Najm,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when the lote tree wa being enveloped by whatever around it
An-Najm,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the sight did not shift nor did it cross the limit
An-Najm,9,0.5574,0.0,0.69,0.31,indeed he saw the supreme sign of his lord
An-Najm,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so did you observe the idol lat and uzza
An-Najm,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and subsequently the third the manat
An-Najm,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what for you the son and for him the daughter
An-Najm,7,-0.1761,0.313,0.435,0.252,then that is surely very unjust distribution
An-Najm,40,0.8674,0.0,0.791,0.209,they are nothing but some name that you have coined you and your forefather allah ha not sent any proof for them they follow only guess and their own desire whereas the guidance from their lord ha come to them
An-Najm,8,0.25,0.0,0.778,0.222,what will man get whatever he dream of
An-Najm,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so know that allah only is the owner of all the hereafter and this world
An-Najm,27,0.5139,0.077,0.743,0.18,and many an angel is in the heaven whose intercession doe not benefit the least unless allah give permission for whomever he will and whom he like
An-Najm,18,0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter coin the name of angel like those of female
An-Najm,26,0.3182,0.0,0.916,0.084,and they do not have any knowledge of it they just follow assumption and indeed assumption doe not serve any purpose in place of the truth
An-Najm,20,0.7096,0.0,0.711,0.289,therefore turn away from whoever ha turned away from our remembrance and ha desired only the life of this world
An-Najm,28,0.7906,0.0,0.727,0.273,this is the extent of their knowledge indeed your lord well know one who ha strayed from his path and he well know one who ha attained guidance

Al-Hadeed,24,0.8766,0.0,0.676,0.324,all whatever is in the heaven and in the earth proclaims the purity of allah and he only is the most honourable the wise
Al-Hadeed,26,-0.1531,0.125,0.769,0.106,for him only is the kingship of the heaven and the earth he give life and cause death and he is able to do all thing
Al-Hadeed,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he only is the first and he only the last and he only is the evident and he only the concealed and it is he who know all thing

Al-Hadeed,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he brings the night in part of the day and brings the day in part of the night and he know what lie within the heart
Al-Hadeed,38,0.9702,0.0,0.561,0.439,accept faith in allah and his noble messenger and spend in his cause from what he ha made you the heir of so for those among you who accepted faith and spent in his cause is great reward
Al-Hadeed,39,0.3578,0.099,0.747,0.154,and what is the matter with you that you should not accept faith in allah whereas this noble messenger is calling you to believe in your lord and allah ha indeed already taken covenant from you if you believe
Al-Hadeed,35,0.624,0.05,0.798,0.152,it is he who sends down clear verse upon his chosen bondman in order to take you out from the realm of darkness towards light and indeed allah is most compassionate most merciful upon you
Al-Hadeed,78,0.91,0.05,0.752,0.197,and what is the matter with you that you should not spend in allah cause whereas allah is the inheritor of all that is in the heaven and in the earth those among you who spent and fought before the conquest of mecca are not equal to others they are greater in rank than those who spent and fought after the conquest and allah ha promised paradise to all of them and allah well know what you do
Al-Hadeed,22,0.875,0.0,0.655,0.345,who will lend handsome loan to allah so that he may double it for him and for such is an honourable reward
Al-Hadeed,50,0.9201,0.0,0.795,0.205,the day when you will see the believing men and believing woman that their light run before them and on their right it being said to them this day the best tidings for you are the garden beneath which river flow abide in it forever this is the greatest success
Al-Hadeed,67,0.4019,0.044,0.874,0.082,the day when hypocrite men and hypocrite woman will say to the muslim look mercifully towards u so that we may gain some of your light it will be said to them turn back search light over there so they will turn around whereupon wall will be erected between them in which is gate inside the gate is mercy and on the outer side is the punishment
Al-Hadeed,63,-0.6369,0.14,0.762,0.098,the hypocrite will call out to the muslim were we not with you they will answer yes you were why not but you had put your soul into trial and you used to await misfortune for the muslim and you doubted and false hope deceived you until allah command came and the big cheat had made you conceited towards the command of allah
Al-Hadeed,29,-0.5945,0.153,0.847,0.0,so this day no ransom is to be taken from you nor from the declared disbeliever your destination is the fire that is your companion and what wretched outcome
Al-Hadeed,52,0.6503,0.037,0.834,0.129,ha not the time come for the believer to surrender their heart to allah remembrance and to this truth that ha come down and do not be like those who were earlier given the book and when long term passed over them their heart became hardened and many of them are sinner
Al-Hadeed,24,-0.3182,0.137,0.772,0.091,know that it is allah who revives the earth after it death we have indeed illustrated the sign for you for you to understand
Al-Hadeed,27,0.9403,0.0,0.584,0.416,indeed the charity giving men and woman and those who lend an excellent loan to allah for them is double and for them is an honourable reward
Al-Hadeed,44,0.5859,0.13,0.657,0.213,and those who believe in allah and all his noble messenger are the truly sincere and are witness upon others before their lord for them is their reward and their light and those who disbelieved and denied our sign are the people of hell
Al-Hadeed,80,0.9668,0.094,0.632,0.274,know that the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime and adornment and boasting amongst yourselves and the desire to surpass each other in wealth and child like the rain the produce of which pleased the farmer then dried so you see it yellow and then turned into dry trampled hay and in the hereafter is severe punishment and the forgiveness from allah and his pleasure and the life of this world is nothing but counterfeit wealth
Al-Hadeed,48,0.9118,0.0,0.773,0.227,rush towards the forgiveness of your lord and paradise wide a the expanse of the heaven and the earth made for those who believe in allah and all his noble messenger this is allah munificence he may bestow it to whomever he will and allah is extremely munificent
Al-Hadeed,28,0.5106,0.051,0.794,0.156,there is no misfortune that reach in the earth or in your self but is mentioned in book before we initiate it indeed this is easy for allah
Al-Hadeed,26,-0.5171,0.223,0.69,0.087,so that you may not be saddened upon losing something nor rejoice upon what you are given and allah doe not like any boastful conceited person
Al-Hadeed,23,-0.5118,0.232,0.643,0.125,those who practice miserliness and exhort others to miserliness and whoever turn away then know that allah is the independent the most praiseworthy
Al-Hadeed,61,0.9217,0.035,0.749,0.215,indeed we sent our noble messenger with proof and sent down the book and the balance of justice along with them so that people may stay upon justice and we sent down iron having severe heat and benefit for mankind and so that allah may see him who without seeing aide him and his noble messenger indeed allah is almighty dominant
Al-Hadeed,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed we sent nooh and ibrahim and placed prophethood and the book among their descendant so some among them took to guidance and many of them are sinner
Al-Hadeed,85,0.9423,0.0,0.832,0.168,we then sent our other noble messenger after them following their footstep and after them we sent eisa the son of maryam and bestowed the injeel to him and we instilled compassion and mercy in the heart of his follower and they invented monasticism which we had not ordained upon them only to seek allah pleasure then did not properly abide by it a it should have been rightfully abided we therefore gave the believer among them their reward and many of them are sinner
Al-Hadeed,50,0.9413,0.049,0.629,0.322,people who believe in the earlier noble messenger fear allah and accept faith in this noble messenger of his he will bestow two portion of his mercy to you and will create light for you to walk in it and will forgive you and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Hadeed,43,0.4939,0.0,0.929,0.071,this is so that the disbeliever among people given the book may know that they do not have any control over allah munificence and that the munificence is in allah hand control he bestows to whomever he will and allah is extremely munificent
Al-Mujadila,46,0.7845,0.085,0.708,0.207,allah ha indeed heard the speech of the woman who is arguing with you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him concerning her husband and is complaining to allah and allah hears the conversation of you both indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
Al-Mujadila,43,0.1918,0.089,0.787,0.124,those among you who have proclaimed their wife a their mother so their wife are not their mother their mother are only those that gave them birth and undoubtedly they utter evil and blatant lie and indeed allah is most pardoning oft forgiving
Al-Mujadila,51,0.7269,0.0,0.869,0.131,and those among you who have proclaimed their wife a their mother and then wish to revert to the matter upon which they had uttered such an enormous word must then free slave before they touch one another this is what you are advised and allah is aware of your deed
Al-Mujadila,58,-0.1531,0.124,0.76,0.115,so one who cannot find slave must then fast for two successive month before they touch one another and one who cannot even fast must then feed sixty needy one this is in order that you keep faith in allah and his noble messenger and these are the limit of allah and for the disbeliever is painful punishment
Al-Mujadila,34,0.0258,0.181,0.635,0.184,indeed those who oppose allah and his noble messenger have been humiliated like those before them who were humiliated and we have indeed sent down clear verse and for the disbeliever is disgraceful punishment
Al-Mujadila,34,0.128,0.052,0.882,0.066,the day when allah will raise all of them together and inform them of their misdeed allah ha kept count of them whereas they have forgotten them and all thing are present before allah
Al-Mujadila,82,0.2732,0.026,0.936,0.039,listener did you not see that allah know all whatever is in the heaven and all whatever is in the earth wherever there is any discussion among three he is the fourth present with them and among five he is the sixth and there is no discussion among fewer or more except that he is with them wherever they may be and then on the day of resurrection he will inform them of all what they did indeed allah know all thing
Al-Mujadila,80,-0.3013,0.14,0.722,0.138,did you not see those who were forbidden from conspiracy yet they do what wa forbidden and consult each other for sinning and for exceeding limit and for disobeying the noble messenger and when they come in your presence they greet you with word not chosen by allah for respectfully greeting you and they inwardly say why doe not allah punish u for what we say hell is sufficient for them they will sink into it and what wretched outcome
Al-Mujadila,38,-0.0516,0.076,0.853,0.071,people who believe when you consult each other do not consult for sinning nor for exceeding limit nor for disobeying the noble messenger and consult for righteousness and piety and fear allah towards whom you will be raised
Al-Mujadila,35,-0.8608,0.252,0.685,0.063,the evil consultation is only from the devil in order that he may upset the believer whereas he cannot harm them in the least without allah command and only upon allah must the muslim rely
Al-Mujadila,59,0.3612,0.0,0.959,0.041,people who believe when you are told to give room in the assembly then do give room allah will give you room in his mercy and when it is said stand up in reverence then do stand up allah will raise the believer among you and those given knowledge to high rank and allah is aware of your deed
Al-Mujadila,45,0.9231,0.0,0.737,0.263,people who believe when you wish to humbly consult with the noble messenger give some charity before you consult that is much better and much purer for you so if you do not have the mean then know that allah is oft forgiving most merciful
Al-Mujadila,48,0.9022,0.025,0.738,0.237,were you afraid to offer charity before you consult so when you did not do this and allah ha inclined towards you with his mercy keep the prayer established and pay the obligatory charity and obey allah and his noble messenger and allah is aware of your deed
Al-Mujadila,29,-0.0516,0.041,0.959,0.0,did you not see those who befriended those upon whom is allah wrath they are neither of you nor of these and they swear false oath whereas they know
Al-Mujadila,14,-0.7178,0.42,0.32,0.26,allah ha kept prepared severe punishment for them indeed they commit extremely evil deed
Al-Mujadila,17,-0.5106,0.235,0.765,0.0,they use their oath a shield therefore preventing from allah way so for them is disgraceful punishment
Al-Mujadila,27,-0.5574,0.2,0.706,0.094,their wealth and their child will be of no use to them before allah they are the people of hell they are to remain in it forever
Al-Mujadila,42,-0.6249,0.157,0.843,0.0,the day when allah will raise them all they will swear in his presence the way they now swear in front of you and they will assume that they have achieved something pay heed indeed it is they who are the liar
Al-Mujadila,29,-0.9485,0.415,0.53,0.055,the devil ha overpowered them so they forgot the remembrance of allah they are the devil group pay heed indeed it is the devil group who are the loser
Al-Mujadila,14,0.4588,0.0,0.812,0.188,indeed those who oppose allah and his noble messenger are among the most despicable
Al-Mujadila,20,0.8313,0.0,0.659,0.341,allah ha already decreed that will indeed be victorious and my noble messenger indeed allah is almighty the most honourable
Al-Mujadila,97,0.9652,0.012,0.776,0.211,you will not find the people who believe in allah and the last day befriending those who oppose allah and his noble messenger even if they are their father or their son or their brother or their tribesman it is these upon whose heart allah ha ingrained faith and ha aided them with spirit from himself and he will admit them into garden beneath which river flow abiding in them forever allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him this is allah group pay heed indeed it is allah group who are the successful
Al-Hashr,27,0.8766,0.0,0.705,0.295,all whatever is in the heaven and all whatever is in the earth proclaims the purity of allah and he only is the most honourable the wise
Al-Hashr,81,0.5141,0.079,0.816,0.104,it is he who expelled the disbeliever among the people given the book from their home for their first gathering you did not expect them to leave whereas they assumed that their fortress would save them from allah so allah command came to them from place they had not imagined and he instilled awe in their heart so they ruin their own house by their own hand and at the hand of the muslim therefore learn lesson those who can perceive
Al-Hashr,29,-0.6908,0.236,0.685,0.079,and had allah not decreed exile for them he would have surely punished them in this world and for them in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire
Al-Hashr,28,0.0516,0.162,0.67,0.168,this is because they remained opposed to allah and his noble messenger and whoever remains opposed to allah and his noble messenger then indeed allah punishment is severe
Al-Hashr,24,-0.6486,0.194,0.806,0.0,the tree you had cut down or left standing on their root wa all by allah permission and in order to disgrace the sinner
Al-Hashr,47,0.7184,0.0,0.882,0.118,and from them the booty which allah gave to his noble messenger so you had not raced your horse or camel against them but it is allah who give whomever he will within the control of his noble messenger and allah is able to do all thing
Al-Hashr,71,-0.033,0.178,0.656,0.166,the booty which allah gave to his noble messenger from the people of the township is for allah and his noble messenger and for the relative and the orphan and the needy and the traveller so that it doe not become the wealth of the rich among you and accept whatever the noble messenger give you and refrain from whatever he forbids you and fear allah indeed allah punishment is severe
Al-Hashr,38,0.8316,0.102,0.64,0.258,and the booty is also for the poor migrant who were expelled from their home and their wealth seeking allah munificence and his pleasure and aiding allah and his noble messenger it is they who are the truthful
Al-Hashr,66,0.7845,0.074,0.75,0.176,and those who accepted this city a their home and accepted faith before them befriend those who migrated towards them and in their breast do not find any need for what they have been given and prefer the migrant above themselves even if they themselves are in dire need and whoever is saved from the greed of his soul it is they who are the successful
Al-Hashr,42,0.8588,0.0,0.774,0.226,and those who came after them say our lord forgive u and our brother who accepted faith before u and do not keep any malice in our heart towards the believer our lord indeed you only are the most compassionate most merciful

Al-Mulk,17,-0.8316,0.342,0.658,0.0,and for those who disbelieved in their lord is the punishment of hell and what wretched outcome
Al-Mulk,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will hear it hissing when they will be thrown into it and it is boiling
Al-Mulk,28,-0.8,0.24,0.701,0.059,a if about to explode with rage whenever group is thrown into it the guardian of hell will ask them did not herald of warning come to you
Al-Mulk,33,-0.7347,0.266,0.613,0.12,they will say yes why not indeed herald of warning did come to u in response we denied and said allah ha not sent down anything you are not except in great error
Al-Mulk,19,-0.6808,0.204,0.796,0.0,and they will say had we listened or understood we would not have been among the people of hell
Al-Mulk,13,-0.7984,0.405,0.493,0.102,so now they admit their sin therefore accursed be the people of hell
Al-Mulk,14,0.584,0.22,0.438,0.342,indeed for those who fear their lord without seeing is forgiveness and great reward
Al-Mulk,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and whether you speak softly or proclaim it aloud he indeed know what lie within the heart
Al-Mulk,16,0.5267,0.0,0.761,0.239,what will he who ha created not know whereas he know every detail the all aware
Al-Mulk,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it is he who subjected the earth for you therefore tread it path and eat from allah sustenance and towards him is the resurrection
Al-Mulk,25,0.296,0.074,0.81,0.116,have you become unafraid of the one who control the heaven that he will not cause you to sink into the earth when it tremble
Al-Mulk,32,0.2263,0.067,0.84,0.092,or have you become unafraid of the one who control the heaven that he will not send torrent of stone upon you so now you will realise how my warning turned out
Al-Mulk,14,-0.7506,0.348,0.652,0.0,and indeed those before them had denied therefore how did my rejection turn out
Al-Mulk,27,0.5984,0.0,0.87,0.13,and did they not see the bird above them spreading and closing their wing none except the most gracious hold them up indeed he see all thing
Al-Mulk,22,0.7645,0.0,0.752,0.248,or which army do you have that will help you against the most gracious the disbeliever are in nothing except an illusion
Al-Mulk,22,-0.7845,0.294,0.706,0.0,or who is such that will give you sustenance if allah stop his sustenance in fact they persist in rebellion and hatred
Al-Mulk,21,0.2263,0.0,0.913,0.087,so is one who walk inverted upon his face more rightly guided or one who walk upright on the straight path
Al-Mulk,31,0.9214,0.0,0.647,0.353,proclaim dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him it is he who created you and made ear and eye and heart for you very little thanks do you offer
Al-Mulk,19,0.34,0.0,0.882,0.118,say it is he who ha spread you out in the earth and towards him you will be raised
Al-Mulk,12,0.6833,0.0,0.64,0.36,and they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
Al-Mulk,13,0.4404,0.136,0.565,0.299,proclaim surely allah ha it knowledge and am only herald of plain warning
Al-Mulk,26,-0.2263,0.071,0.929,0.0,so when they will see it close the face of the disbeliever will become ghastly and it will be declared this is what you were demanding
Al-Mulk,41,0.5859,0.171,0.571,0.257,say dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him what is your opinion allah may either destroy me and those with me or have mercy on u so who is such that will protect the disbeliever from the painful punishment
Al-Mulk,29,0.7264,0.074,0.685,0.241,proclaim he only is the most gracious we have accepted faith in him and have relied only upon him so you will now realise who is in open error
Al-Mulk,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,say what is your opinion if in the morning all your water were to sink into the earth then who is such who can bring you water flowing before you
Al-Qalam,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nuun by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meaning
Al-Qalam,10,0.3089,0.0,0.799,0.201,you are not insane by the munificence of your lord
Al-Qalam,8,0.5719,0.0,0.654,0.346,and indeed for you is an unlimited reward
Al-Qalam,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed you posse an exemplary character
Al-Qalam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so very soon you will see and they too will realise
Al-Qalam,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,name
Al-Qalam,21,0.4939,0.0,0.819,0.181,indeed your lord well know those who have strayed from his path and he well know those who are upon guidance
Al-Qalam,7,-0.3612,0.294,0.706,0.0,therefore do not listen to the denier
Al-Qalam,16,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,they wish that in some way you may yield so they too might soften their stand
Al-Qalam,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nor ever listen to any excessive oath maker ignoble person
Al-Qalam,7,-0.765,0.569,0.431,0.0,the excessively insulting one spreader of spite
Al-Qalam,8,0.1531,0.205,0.536,0.259,one who excessively forbids the good transgressor sinner
Al-Qalam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,foul mouthed and in addition to all this of improper lineage
Al-Qalam,15,0.6808,0.0,0.699,0.301,because he ha some wealth and son walid bin mugaira who cursed the holy prophet
Al-Qalam,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when our verse are recited to him he say these are story of earlier people
Al-Qalam,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we will soon singe his pig nose
Al-Qalam,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we have indeed tested them the way we had tested the owner of the garden when they swore that they would reap it harvest the next morning
Al-Qalam,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they did not say if allah will
Al-Qalam,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so an envoy from your lord completed his round upon the garden whilst they were sleeping
Al-Qalam,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so in the morning it became a if harvested
Al-Qalam,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they then called out to each other at daybreak
Al-Qalam,13,0.0772,0.0,0.902,0.098,that go to your field at early morn if you want to harvest
Al-Qalam,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they went off while whispering to one another
Al-Qalam,11,-0.3182,0.309,0.537,0.154,make sure that no needy person enters your garden this day
Al-Qalam,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they left at early morn assuming they were in control of their purpose
Al-Qalam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then when they saw it they said we have indeed strayed
Al-Qalam,5,-0.4588,0.429,0.571,0.0,in fact we are unfortunate
Al-Qalam,16,0.6369,0.0,0.781,0.219,the best among them said did not tell you why do you not proclaim his purity
Al-Qalam,12,-0.5106,0.231,0.769,0.0,they said purity is to our lord we have indeed been unjust
Al-Qalam,7,-0.4939,0.348,0.652,0.0,so they came towards each other blaming
Al-Qalam,9,-0.6124,0.455,0.545,0.0,they said woe to u we were indeed rebellious
Al-Qalam,16,0.6808,0.0,0.699,0.301,hopefully our lord will give u better replacement than this we now incline towards our lord
Al-Qalam,18,-0.296,0.25,0.586,0.164,such is the punishment and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is the greatest if only they knew
Al-Qalam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed for the pious with their lord are garden of serenity
Al-Qalam,8,-0.4215,0.286,0.714,0.0,shall we equate the muslim to the guilty
Al-Qalam,12,-0.2732,0.165,0.752,0.083,what is the matter with you what sort of judgement you impose
Al-Qalam,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,is there book for you from which you read
Al-Qalam,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,name
Al-Qalam,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or is it that you have covenant from u right up to the day of judgement that you will get all what you claim
Al-Qalam,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ask them who among them is guarantor for it
Al-Qalam,20,0.6369,0.0,0.776,0.224,or is it that they have partner in worship so they should bring their appointed partner if they are truthful
Al-Qalam,24,-0.0772,0.056,0.944,0.0,on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves they will be unable used a metaphor
Al-Qalam,20,-0.25,0.193,0.697,0.111,with lowered eye disgrace overcoming them and indeed they used to be called to prostrate themselves whilst they were healthy
Al-Qalam,23,-0.4357,0.159,0.796,0.045,therefore leave the one who denies this matter to me we shall soon steadily take them away from place they do not know
Al-Qalam,11,0.2247,0.0,0.841,0.159,and will give them respite indeed my plan is very solid
Al-Qalam,26,0.5165,0.164,0.579,0.256,or is it that you dear prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him ask any fee from them so they are burdened with the penalty
Al-Qalam,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or that they posse the hidden so they are writing it
Al-Qalam,29,-0.5873,0.226,0.679,0.095,therefore wait for your lord command and do not be like the one of the fish who cried out when he wa distraught prophet yunus peace be upon him
Al-Qalam,21,0.7351,0.0,0.714,0.286,were it not for his lord favour that reached him he would have surely been cast onto the desolate land reproached
Al-Qalam,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,his lord therefore chose him and made him among those deserving his proximity
Al-Qalam,28,-0.7964,0.221,0.779,0.0,and indeed the disbeliever seem a if they would topple you with their evil gaze when they hear the qur an and they say he is indeed insane
Al-Qalam,11,0.3919,0.0,0.791,0.209,whereas it is not but an advice to the entire creation
Al-Haaqqa,3,0.4215,0.0,0.417,0.583,the true event
Al-Haaqqa,6,0.4215,0.0,0.641,0.359,how tremendous is the true event
Al-Haaqqa,11,0.4215,0.0,0.781,0.219,and what have you understood how tremendous the true event is
Al-Haaqqa,16,-0.1531,0.25,0.57,0.18,the tribe of thamud and ad denied the event of great dismay the day of resurrection
Al-Haaqqa,10,-0.8402,0.562,0.438,0.0,so regarding the thamud they were destroyed by terrible scream
Al-Haaqqa,11,-0.7003,0.42,0.58,0.0,and a for ad they were destroyed by severe thundering windstorm
Al-Haaqqa,30,0.0516,0.148,0.699,0.153,he forced it upon them with strength consecutively for seven night and eight day so you would see those people overthrown in it like trunk of date palm fallen down
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.3612,0.0,0.737,0.263,so do you see any survivor among them
Al-Haaqqa,17,-0.3818,0.144,0.798,0.059,and firaun and those before him and the dwelling that were inverted and thrown had brought error
Al-Haaqqa,17,0.5106,0.0,0.777,0.223,they therefore disobeyed the noble messenger of their lord so he seized them with an intense seizure
Al-Haaqqa,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed when the water swelled up we boarded you onto the ship
Al-Haaqqa,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in order to make it remembrance for you and in order that the ear that store may remember
Al-Haaqqa,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so when the trumpet will be blown with sudden single blow
Al-Haaqqa,15,-0.5267,0.253,0.747,0.0,and the earth and the mountain will be lifted up and crushed with single crush
Al-Haaqqa,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so that is the day when the forthcoming event will occur
Al-Haaqqa,14,0.2023,0.14,0.674,0.185,and the heaven will split asunder so on that day it will be unstable
Al-Haaqqa,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the angel will be on it side and on that day eight angel will carry the throne of your lord above them
Al-Haaqqa,22,-0.4707,0.211,0.789,0.0,on that day all of you will be brought forth so none among you wishing to hide will be able to hide
Al-Haaqqa,17,0.4939,0.0,0.833,0.167,so whoever is given his book in his right hand he will say take read my account
Al-Haaqqa,7,0.1027,0.193,0.568,0.239,wa certain that will confront my account
Al-Haaqqa,7,0.2732,0.0,0.741,0.259,he is therefore in the desired serenity
Al-Haaqqa,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in lofty garden
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the fruit cluster of which are hanging down
Al-Haaqqa,16,0.8126,0.0,0.654,0.346,eat and drink with pleasure the reward of what you sent ahead in the past day
Al-Haaqqa,23,0.4939,0.0,0.873,0.127,and whoever is given his book in his left hand he will say ala if only my account were not given to me
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and had never come to know my account
Al-Haaqqa,8,-0.5994,0.358,0.642,0.0,ala if only it had been just death
Al-Haaqqa,9,0.1828,0.196,0.552,0.252,my wealth did not in the least benefit me
Al-Haaqqa,5,0.34,0.0,0.625,0.375,all my power ha vanished
Al-Haaqqa,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it will be said seize him and shackle him
Al-Haaqqa,7,-0.34,0.286,0.714,0.0,then hurl him into the blazing fire
Al-Haaqqa,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then bind him inside chain which is seventy arm length
Al-Haaqqa,10,0.8126,0.124,0.337,0.539,indeed he refused to accept faith in allah the greatest
Al-Haaqqa,8,-0.34,0.255,0.745,0.0,and did not urge to feed the needy
Al-Haaqqa,10,-0.3875,0.226,0.774,0.0,so he doe not have any friend here this day
Al-Haaqqa,12,-0.7717,0.401,0.599,0.0,nor any food except the pu discharged from the people of hell
Al-Haaqqa,7,0.3252,0.0,0.72,0.28,which none except the guilty shall eat
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so by oath of the thing you see
Al-Haaqqa,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and by oath of those you do not see
Al-Haaqqa,12,0.765,0.0,0.602,0.398,this qur an is the speech of allah with gracious noble messenger
Al-Haaqqa,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and it is not the speech of poet how little do you believe
Al-Haaqqa,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nor is it the speech of soothsayer how little do you ponder
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.2732,0.0,0.769,0.231,sent down by the lord of the creation
Al-Haaqqa,9,0.0258,0.0,0.864,0.136,and had he fabricated just one matter upon u
Al-Haaqqa,8,-0.1779,0.281,0.496,0.223,we would have definitely taken revenge from him
Al-Haaqqa,8,-0.2732,0.231,0.769,0.0,then would have cut off his heart artery
Al-Haaqqa,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then none among you would be his saviour
Al-Haaqqa,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed this qur an is an advice for the pious
Al-Haaqqa,10,-0.3612,0.217,0.783,0.0,and indeed we know that some among you are denier
Al-Haaqqa,8,-0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,and indeed it is despair for the disbeliever

Al-Insaan,19,0.25,0.0,0.9,0.1,indeed we have created man from mixed semen in order to test him we therefore made him hearing knowing
Al-Insaan,13,0.4588,0.0,0.8,0.2,we have indeed shown him the way whether he is grateful or ingrate
Al-Insaan,14,-0.128,0.147,0.736,0.117,we have indeed kept prepared chain and shackle and blazing fire for the disbeliever
Al-Insaan,11,0.5267,0.0,0.746,0.254,indeed the virtuous will drink from cup containing mixture of kafoor
Al-Insaan,23,0.4019,0.0,0.891,0.109,the kafoor is spring from which the chosen bondman of allah will drink causing it to flow wherever they wish inside their palace
Al-Insaan,13,-0.8225,0.409,0.591,0.0,they fulfil their pledge and fear day the evil of which is widespread
Al-Insaan,16,-0.1779,0.255,0.563,0.182,and out of his love they give food to the needy the orphan and the prisoner
Al-Insaan,24,-0.0253,0.107,0.789,0.104,they say to them we give you food only for the sake of allah we do not seek any reward or thanks from you
Al-Insaan,13,-0.8573,0.486,0.514,0.0,indeed we fear from our lord day which is extremely bitter most severe
Al-Insaan,16,0.3566,0.181,0.535,0.283,so allah saved them from the evil of that day and gave them freshness and joy
Al-Insaan,12,0.836,0.0,0.533,0.467,and gave them paradise and silk clothes a reward for their patience
Al-Insaan,18,0.6738,0.0,0.743,0.257,reclining in it upon throne they will not see the hot sunshine in it nor the bitter cold
Al-Insaan,15,-0.2732,0.13,0.87,0.0,and it shade will cover them and it fruit cluster brought down low for them
Al-Insaan,15,0.3612,0.0,0.848,0.152,round of silver cup and silver beaker looking like glass will be presented upon them
Al-Insaan,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,glass made from silver which the server have filled up to the measure
Al-Insaan,15,0.6369,0.0,0.769,0.231,and in paradise they will be given to drink cup filled with mixture of ginger
Al-Insaan,7,0.6369,0.0,0.588,0.412,which is spring in paradise called salsabeel
Al-Insaan,19,0.25,0.0,0.9,0.1,immortal youth shall surround them waiting upon them when you see them you would think they are scattered pearl
Al-Insaan,13,0.6249,0.0,0.745,0.255,and when you look towards it you will see serenity and great kingdom
Al-Insaan,29,0.4019,0.0,0.879,0.121,in it they adorn clothes of fine green silk and gold embroidery and they are given silver bracelet to wear and their lord gave them pure wine to drink
Al-Insaan,16,0.7906,0.0,0.667,0.333,it will be said to them this is your reward indeed your effort have been appreciated
Al-Insaan,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed we have sent down the qur an upon you in stage
Al-Insaan,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,therefore stay patient upon your lord command and do not listen to any of the sinner or ingrate among them
Al-Insaan,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
Al-Insaan,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and prostrate for him in part of the night and proclaim his purity into the long night
Al-Insaan,19,0.7184,0.0,0.739,0.261,indeed these people love what they have the fleeting one and have forsaken the immensely important day behind them
Al-Insaan,22,0.743,0.0,0.722,0.278,it is we who created them and strengthened their skeleton and we can replace them with others like them whenever we will
Al-Insaan,15,0.4549,0.0,0.825,0.175,this is indeed an advice so whoever wish may take the path towards his lord
Al-Insaan,15,0.7003,0.0,0.691,0.309,and what will you wish except if allah will indeed allah is all knowing wise
Al-Insaan,18,-0.34,0.32,0.374,0.306,he admits into his mercy whomever he will and for the unjust he ha kept prepared painful punishment

An-Naba,8,-0.4404,0.293,0.707,0.0,and they denied our sign to the extreme
An-Naba,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we have kept recorded everything in book accounted for

An-Naba,47,0.9117,0.0,0.773,0.227,the day when jibreel and all the angel will stand in row none will be able to speak except one whom the most gracious command and who spoke rightly prophet mohammed peace and blessing be upon him will be the first to be granted permission to intercede
An-Naba,15,0.4215,0.0,0.833,0.167,that is the true day therefore whoever will may take the path towards his lord

An-Naaziaat,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,by oath of those who harshly pull out the soul of the disbeliever
An-Naaziaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and who softly release the soul of the believer
An-Naaziaat,5,0.3612,0.0,0.615,0.385,and who glide with ease
An-Naaziaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and who quickly present themselves
An-Naaziaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and who plan the implementation
An-Naaziaat,16,-0.6597,0.351,0.541,0.108,on the day when the trembling one will tremble the disbeliever will certainly taste the punishment
An-Naaziaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the following event will come after it
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,many heart will flutter on that day
An-Naaziaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,unable to lift their gaze
An-Naaziaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the disbeliever say will we really return to our former state
An-Naaziaat,6,-0.3818,0.342,0.658,0.0,when we have become decayed bone
An-Naaziaat,9,-0.3182,0.223,0.777,0.0,they said so this return is an obvious loss
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so that is not but single shout
An-Naaziaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they will immediately be in an open plain
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0258,0.0,0.845,0.155,did the news of moosa reach you
An-Naaziaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
An-Naaziaat,7,0.1027,0.213,0.532,0.255,that go to firaun he ha rebelled

An-Naaziaat,12,-0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,and may guide you to your lord so that you may fear
An-Naaziaat,6,0.5994,0.0,0.562,0.438,so moosa showed him magnificent sign
An-Naaziaat,6,-0.4404,0.367,0.633,0.0,in response he denied and disobeyed
An-Naaziaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he then turned away striving in his effort
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he gathered the people and proclaimed
An-Naaziaat,8,0.5984,0.0,0.643,0.357,and then said am your most supreme lord
An-Naaziaat,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,allah therefore seized him in the punishment of this world and the hereafter
An-Naaziaat,9,-0.4939,0.286,0.714,0.0,indeed in this is lesson for one who fear
An-Naaziaat,17,0.8316,0.0,0.57,0.43,do you think that it is harder to create you or the heaven allah ha created it
An-Naaziaat,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he raised it roof and made it proper
An-Naaziaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and he made it night dark and started it light
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and after it spread out the earth
An-Naaziaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and from it produced it water and it pasture
An-Naaziaat,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and solidified the mountain
An-Naaziaat,8,0.4588,0.0,0.7,0.3,in order to benefit you and your cattle
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0935,0.302,0.369,0.329,so when the greatest universal disaster arrives
An-Naaziaat,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on that day man will recall all what he strove for
An-Naaziaat,12,-0.6808,0.295,0.705,0.0,and hell will be made visible to all those who can see
An-Naaziaat,5,-0.25,0.333,0.667,0.0,so for one who rebelled
An-Naaziaat,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and preferred the worldly life
An-Naaziaat,7,-0.6808,0.434,0.566,0.0,then indeed hell only is his destination
An-Naaziaat,16,-0.128,0.161,0.704,0.136,and for one who feared to stand before his lord and restrained his soul from desire
An-Naaziaat,7,0.6369,0.0,0.588,0.412,then indeed paradise only is his destination
An-Naaziaat,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they the disbeliever ask you regarding the last day a to when is it appointed time
An-Naaziaat,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what concern do you have regarding it explanation you are not bound to tell them
An-Naaziaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,towards your lord only is it conclusion
An-Naaziaat,11,-0.8126,0.451,0.549,0.0,you are but herald of warning for one who fear it
An-Naaziaat,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day when they will see it it will seem a if they had not stayed on earth except for an evening or it morning
Abasa,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he frowned and turned away
Abasa,10,-0.4019,0.231,0.769,0.0,because the blind man had come in his august presence
Abasa,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and what do you know he may be of the pure
Abasa,12,0.6808,0.0,0.641,0.359,or that he may accept advice so the advice may benefit him
Abasa,6,-0.3875,0.345,0.655,0.0,for him who doe not care
Abasa,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so you are after him
Abasa,12,0.3089,0.0,0.83,0.17,and you have nothing to lose if he doe not become pure
Abasa,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and for him who came to you striving

Abasa,8,0.0314,0.163,0.661,0.176,so you leave him and are engrossed elsewhere
Abasa,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,not this way this is the advice
Abasa,6,0.4549,0.0,0.627,0.373,so whoever wish may remember it

Abasa,6,0.296,0.0,0.694,0.306,then eased the way for him
Abasa,11,-0.7579,0.419,0.581,0.0,then gave him death so had him put in the grave
Abasa,41,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then when he willed he brought him out a during the night of holy prophet ascension when all the prophet gathered behind him in the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem or when allah will raise everyone on the day of resurrection
