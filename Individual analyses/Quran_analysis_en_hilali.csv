Al-Araf,77,0.8693,0.0,0.819,0.181,and we brought the child of israel with safety across the sea and they came upon people devoted to some of their idol in worship they said musa moses make for u an ilahan god a they have aliha god he said verily you are people who know not the majesty and greatness of allah and what is obligatory upon you to worship none but allah alone the one and the only god of all that exists

Al-Araf,33,-0.5588,0.21,0.673,0.117,and when they regretted and saw that they had gone astray they repented and said if our lord have not mercy upon u and forgive u we shall certainly be of the loser
Al-Araf,105,-0.9535,0.199,0.732,0.07,and when musa moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said what an evil thing is that which you have done worshipping the calf during my absence did you hasten and go ahead a regard the matter of your lord you left his worship and he threw down the tablet and seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him towards him harun aaron said son of my mother indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me so make not the enemy rejoice over me nor put me amongst the people who are zalimun wrong doer

Al-Araf,101,0.5694,0.108,0.752,0.14,and musa moses chose out of his people seventy of the best men for our appointed time and place of meeting and when they were seized with violent earthquake he said my lord if it had been your will you could have destroyed them and me before would you destroy u for the deed of the foolish one among u it is only your trial by which you lead astray whom you will and keep guided whom you will you are our wali protector so forgive u and have mercy on u for you are the best of those who forgive

Al-Araf,106,-0.5216,0.061,0.899,0.04,say muhammad saw mankind verily am sent to you all a the messenger of allah to whom belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth la ilaha illa huwa none ha the right to be worshipped but he it is he who give life and cause death so believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw the prophet who can neither read nor write muhammad saw who belief in allah and his word this quran the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and also allah word be and he wa iesa jesus son of maryam mary and follow him so that you may be guided

Al-Araf,85,-0.5994,0.089,0.865,0.046,and we divided them into twelve tribe a distinct nation we directed musa moses by inspiration when his people asked him for water saying strike the stone with your stick and there gushed forth out of it twelve spring each group knew it own place for water we shaded them with the cloud and sent down upon them al manna and the quail saying eat of the good thing with which we have provided you they harmed u not but they used to harm themselves
Al-Araf,49,0.8225,0.105,0.625,0.27,and remember when it wa said to them dwell in this town jerusalem and eat therefrom wherever you wish and say allah forgive our sin and enter the gate prostrate bowing with humility we shall forgive you your wrong doings we shall increase the reward for the good doer
Al-Araf,30,-0.5927,0.209,0.679,0.112,but those among them who did wrong changed the word that had been told to them so we sent on them torment from heaven in return for their wrong doings
Al-Araf,61,-0.4019,0.06,0.922,0.017,and ask them muhammad saw about the town that wa by the sea when they transgressed in the matter of the sabbath saturday when their fish came to them openly on the sabbath day and did not come to them on the day they had no sabbath thus we made trial of them for they used to rebel see the quran
Al-Araf,44,-0.8885,0.264,0.677,0.059,and when community among them said why do you preach to people whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with severe torment the preacher said in order to be free from guilt before your lord allah and perhaps they may fear allah
Al-Araf,35,-0.882,0.276,0.681,0.043,so when they forgot the remindings that had been given to them we rescued those who forbade evil but we seized those who did wrong with severe torment because they used to rebel disobey allah
Al-Araf,48,-0.875,0.2,0.8,0.0,so when they exceeded the limit of what they were prohibited we said to them be you monkey despised and rejected it is severe warning to the mankind that they should not disobey what allah command them to do and be far away from what he prohibits them
Al-Araf,58,0.4939,0.083,0.772,0.145,and remember when your lord declared that he would certainly keep on sending against them the jew till the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with humiliating torment verily your lord is quick in retribution for the disobedient wicked and certainly he is oft forgiving most merciful for the obedient and those who beg allah forgiveness
Al-Araf,45,-0.34,0.137,0.751,0.112,and we have broken them the jew up into various separate group on the earth some of them are righteous and some are away from that and we tried them with good blessing and evil calamity in order that they might turn to allah obedience
Al-Araf,115,0.8442,0.146,0.636,0.218,then after them succeeded an evil generation which inherited the book but they chose for themselves the good of this low life evil pleasure of this world saying a an excuse everything will be forgiven to u and if again the offer of the like evil pleasure of this world came their way they would again seize them would commit those sin wa not the covenant of the book taken from them that they would not say about allah anything but the truth and they have studied what is in it the book and the home of the hereafter is better for those who are al muttaqun the pious see do not you then understand

Yusuf,40,0.7506,0.0,0.833,0.167,so when they took him away they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well and we inspired in him indeed you shall one day inform them of this their affair when they know you not
Yusuf,14,-0.4404,0.182,0.818,0.0,and they came to their father in the early part of the night weeping
Yusuf,33,0.4497,0.0,0.913,0.087,they said our father we went racing with one another and left yusuf joseph by our belonging and wolf devoured him but you will never believe u even when we speak the truth
Yusuf,41,0.2617,0.055,0.866,0.079,and they brought his shirt stained with false blood he said nay but your ownselves have made up tale so for me patience is most fitting and it is allah alone whose help can be sought against that which you assert
Yusuf,45,0.5141,0.035,0.86,0.105,and there came caravan of traveller they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket into the well he said what good news here is boy so they hid him a merchandise slave and allah wa the all knower of what they did
Yusuf,23,-0.5423,0.176,0.824,0.0,and they sold him for low price for few dirham for few silver coin and they were of those who regarded him insignificant
Yusuf,64,0.631,0.0,0.89,0.11,and he the man from egypt who bought him said to his wife make his stay comfortable may be he will profit u or we shall adopt him a son thus did we establish yusuf joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of event and allah ha full power and control over his affair but most of men know not
Yusuf,26,0.875,0.0,0.697,0.303,and when he yusuf joseph attained his full manhood we gave him wisdom and knowledge the prophethood thus we reward the muhsinun doer of good see
Yusuf,62,-0.8377,0.214,0.67,0.116,and she in whose house he wa sought to seduce him to do an evil act she closed the door and said come on you he said seek refuge in allah or allah forbid truly he your husband is my master he made my stay agreeable so will never betray him verily the zalimun wrong and evil doer will never be successful
Yusuf,47,-0.1779,0.137,0.72,0.142,and indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her desire had he not seen the evidence of his lord thus it wa that we might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse surely he wa one of our chosen guided slave
Yusuf,54,-0.93,0.216,0.784,0.0,so they raced with one another to the door and she tore his shirt from the back they both found her lord her husband at the door she said what is the recompense punishment for him who intended an evil design against your wife except that he be put in prison or painful torment
Yusuf,40,-0.5423,0.158,0.781,0.061,he yusuf joseph said it wa she that sought to seduce me and witness of her household bore witness saying if it be that his shirt is torn from the front then her tale is true and he is liar
Yusuf,23,0.5499,0.088,0.701,0.212,but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back then she ha told lie and he is speaking the truth
Yusuf,29,0.5106,0.06,0.781,0.159,so when he her husband saw his yusuf joseph shirt torn at the back her husband said surely it is plot of you woman certainly mighty is your plot
Yusuf,18,-0.7269,0.296,0.617,0.086,yusuf joseph turn away from this woman ask forgiveness for your sin verily you were of the sinful
Yusuf,31,-0.3182,0.168,0.724,0.109,and woman in the city said the wife of al aziz is seeking to seduce her slave young man indeed she love him violently verily we see her in plain error
Yusuf,76,0.3442,0.144,0.719,0.137,so when she heard of their accusation she sent for them and prepared banquet for them she gave each one of them knife to cut the foodstuff with and she said to yusuf joseph come out before them then when they saw him they exalted him at his beauty and in their astonishment cut their hand they said how perfect is allah or allah forbid no man is this this is none other than noble angel
Yusuf,51,-0.8765,0.241,0.672,0.087,she said this is he the young man about whom you did blame me for his love and did seek to seduce him but he refused and now if he refuse to obey my order he shall certainly be cast into prison and will be one of those who are disgraced
Yusuf,49,-0.5478,0.157,0.728,0.115,he said my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me unless you turn away their plot from me will feel inclined towards them and be one of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deed of the ignorants
Yusuf,22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so his lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot verily he is the all hearer the all knower
Yusuf,19,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126,then it appeared to them after they had seen the proof of his innocence to imprison him for time
Yusuf,62,0.3818,0.049,0.848,0.103,and there entered with him two young men in the prison one of them said verily saw myself in dream pressing wine the other said verily saw myself in dream carrying bread on my head and bird were eating thereof they said inform u of the interpretation of this verily we think you are one of the muhsinun doer of good see
Yusuf,73,0.2023,0.07,0.838,0.092,he said no food will come to you in wakefulness or in dream a your provision but will inform in wakefulness it interpretation before it the food come this is of that which my lord ha taught me verily have abandoned the religion of people that believe not in allah and are disbeliever in the hereafter the kan aniun of egypt who were polytheist and used to worship sun and other false deity
Yusuf,51,0.4999,0.042,0.856,0.101,and have followed the religion of my father ibrahim abraham ishaque isaac and ya qub jacob and never could we attribute any partner whatsoever to allah this is from the grace of allah to u and to mankind but most men thank not they neither believe in allah nor worship him
Yusuf,17,0.4767,0.139,0.549,0.312,two companion of the prison are many different lord god better or allah the one the irresistible
Yusuf,58,0.7978,0.094,0.711,0.195,you do not worship besides him but only name which you have named forged you and your father for which allah ha sent down no authority the command or the judgement is for none but allah he ha commanded that you worship none but him his monotheism that is the true straight religion but most men know not
Yusuf,52,-0.5106,0.064,0.936,0.0,two companion of the prison a for one of you he a servant will pour out wine for his lord king or master to drink and a for the other he will be crucified and bird will eat from his head thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire
Yusuf,71,-0.705,0.142,0.79,0.068,and he said to the one whom he knew to be saved mention me to your lord your king so a to get me out of the prison but shaitan satan made him forget to mention it to his lord or satan made yusuf joseph to forget the remembrance of his lord allah a to ask for his help instead of others so yusuf joseph stayed in prison few more year
Yusuf,44,0.6124,0.0,0.872,0.128,and the king of egypt said verily saw in dream seven fat cow whom seven lean one were devouring and of seven green ear of corn and seven others dry notable explain to me my dream if it be that you can interpret dream
Yusuf,16,0.4588,0.0,0.778,0.222,they said mixed up false dream and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dream
Yusuf,29,-0.5106,0.105,0.895,0.0,then the man who wa released one of the two who were in prison now at length remembered and said will tell you it interpretation so send me forth
Yusuf,45,0.5106,0.0,0.907,0.093,he said yusuf joseph the man of truth explain to u the dream of seven fat cow whom seven lean one were devouring and of seven green ear of corn and seven others dry that may return to the people and that they may know
Yusuf,33,-0.0516,0.037,0.963,0.0,yusuf joseph said for seven consecutive year you shall sow a usual and that the harvest which you reap you shall leave in ear all except little of it which you may eat
Yusuf,30,-0.1027,0.046,0.954,0.0,then will come after that seven hard year which will devour what you have laid by in advance for them all except little of that which you have guarded stored
Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then thereafter will come year in which people will have abundant rain and in which they will press wine and oil
Yusuf,44,0.8462,0.05,0.748,0.202,and the king said bring him to me but when the messenger came to him yusuf joseph said return to your lord and ask him what happened to the woman who cut their hand surely my lord allah is well aware of their plot
Yusuf,56,-0.1779,0.133,0.745,0.122,the king said to the woman what wa your affair when you did seek to seduce yusuf joseph the woman said allah forbid no evil know we against him the wife of al aziz said now the truth is manifest to all it wa who sought to seduce him and he is surely of the truthful
Yusuf,32,-0.6124,0.114,0.886,0.0,then yusuf joseph said asked for this enquiry in order that he al aziz may know that betrayed him not in secret and verily allah guide not the plot of the betrayer
Yusuf,34,0.2263,0.153,0.652,0.196,and free not myself from the blame verily the human self is inclined to evil except when my lord bestows his mercy upon whom he will verily my lord is oft forgiving most merciful
Yusuf,36,0.5256,0.0,0.909,0.091,and the king said bring him to me that may attach him to my person then when he spoke to him he said verily this day you are with u high in rank and fully trusted
Yusuf,35,-0.6486,0.115,0.885,0.0,yusuf joseph said set me over the storehouse of the land will indeed guard them with full knowledge a minister of finance in egypt in place of al aziz who wa dead at that time
Yusuf,47,0.9344,0.0,0.694,0.306,thus did we give full authority to yusuf joseph in the land to take possession therein a when or where he like we bestow of our mercy on whom we please and we make not to be lost the reward of al muhsinun the good doer see
Yusuf,43,-0.4576,0.198,0.638,0.164,and verily the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and used to fear allah and keep their duty to him by abstaining from all kind of sin and evil deed and by performing all kind of righteous good deed
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and yusuf joseph brother came and they entered unto him and he recognized them but they recognized him not
Yusuf,41,0.6369,0.0,0.905,0.095,and when he had furnished them forth with provision according to their need he said bring me brother of yours from your father he meant benjamin see you not that give full measure and that am the best of the host
Yusuf,25,-0.4215,0.104,0.896,0.0,but if you bring him not to me there shall be no measure of corn for you with me nor shall you come near me
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we shall try to get permission for him from his father and verily we shall do it
Yusuf,40,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and yusuf joseph told his servant to put their money with which they had bought the corn into their bag so that they might know it when they go back to their people in order that they might come back
Yusuf,42,0.1779,0.05,0.884,0.066,so when they returned to their father they said our father no more measure of grain shall we get unless we take our brother so send our brother with u and we shall get our measure and truly we will guard him
Yusuf,35,0.8873,0.0,0.748,0.252,he said can entrust him to you except a entrusted his brother yusuf joseph to you aforetime but allah is the best to guard and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
Yusuf,64,0.8055,0.0,0.879,0.121,and when they opened their bag they found their money had been returned to them they said our father what more can we desire this our money ha been returned to u so we shall get more food for our family and we shall guard our brother and add one more measure of camel load this quantity is easy for the king to give
Yusuf,56,-0.6486,0.123,0.877,0.0,he ya qub jacob said will not send him with you until you swear solemn oath to me in allah name that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded by enemy etc and when they had sworn their solemn oath he said allah is the witness over what we have said
Yusuf,47,0.9366,0.0,0.767,0.233,and he said my son do not enter by one gate but enter by different gate and cannot avail you against allah at all verily the decision rest only with allah in him put my trust and let all those that trust put their trust in him
Yusuf,52,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when they entered according to their father advice it did not avail them in the least against the will of allah it wa but need of ya qub jacob inner self which he discharged and verily he wa endowed with knowledge because we had taught him but most men know not
Yusuf,30,-0.5214,0.104,0.896,0.0,and when they went in before yusuf joseph he betook his brother benjamin to himself and said verily am your brother so grieve not for what they used to do
Yusuf,30,-0.4767,0.167,0.752,0.081,so when he had furnished them forth with their provision he put the golden bowl into his brother bag then crier cried you in the caravan surely you are thief
Yusuf,12,-0.296,0.167,0.833,0.0,they turning towards them said what is it that you have missed
Yusuf,28,0.3612,0.069,0.815,0.116,they said we have missed the golden bowl of the king and for him who produce it is the reward of camel load will be bound by it
Yusuf,22,-0.5408,0.21,0.711,0.079,they said by allah indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land and we are no thief
Yusuf,20,-0.743,0.259,0.741,0.0,they yusuf joseph men said what then shall be the penalty of him if you are proved to be liar
Yusuf,34,-0.9451,0.358,0.642,0.0,they yusuf joseph brother said the penalty should be that he in whose bag it is found should be held for the punishment of the crime thus we punish the zalimun wrong doer etc
Yusuf,86,-0.3919,0.049,0.932,0.019,so he yusuf joseph began the search in their bag before the bag of his brother then he brought it out of his brother bag thus did we plan for yusuf joseph he could not take his brother by the law of the king a slave except that allah willed it so allah made the brother to bind themselves with their way of punishment enslaving of thief we raise to degree whom we please but over all those endowed with knowledge is the all knowing allah
Yusuf,54,-0.0258,0.146,0.725,0.129,they yusuf joseph brother said if he steal there wa brother of his yusuf joseph who did steal before him but these thing did yusuf joseph keep in himself revealing not the secret to them he said within himself you are in worst case and allah know best the truth of what you assert

Yusuf,28,-0.7003,0.182,0.818,0.0,he said allah forbid that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property indeed if we did so we should be zalimun wrong doer
Yusuf,70,-0.4794,0.095,0.837,0.068,so when they despaired of him they held conference in private the eldest among them said know you not that your father did take an oath from you in allah name and before this you did fail in your duty with yusuf joseph therefore will not leave this land until my father permit me or allah decides my case by releasing benjamin and he is the best of the judge
Yusuf,31,-0.2023,0.092,0.838,0.069,return to your father and say our father verily your son benjamin ha stolen and we testify not except according to what we know and we could not know the unseen
Yusuf,25,0.3182,0.0,0.913,0.087,and ask the people of the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned and indeed we are telling the truth
Yusuf,40,0.8402,0.0,0.826,0.174,he ya qub jacob said nay but your ownselves have beguiled you into something so patience is most fitting for me may be allah will bring them back all to me truly he only he is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,27,-0.836,0.271,0.729,0.0,and he turned away from them and said ala my grief for yusuf joseph and he lost his sight because of the sorrow that he wa suppressing
Yusuf,25,-0.802,0.238,0.762,0.0,they said by allah you will never cease remembering yusuf joseph until you become weak with old age or until you be of the dead

Al-Kahf,27,0.743,0.0,0.767,0.233,we narrate unto you muhammad saw their story with truth truly they were young men who believed in their lord allah and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,72,0.891,0.0,0.842,0.158,and we made their heart firm and strong with the light of faith in allah and bestowed upon them patience to bear the separation of their kith and kin and dwelling etc when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth never shall we call upon any ilah god other than him if we did we should indeed have uttered an enormity in disbelief
Al-Kahf,34,0.4228,0.084,0.714,0.202,these our people have taken for worship aliha god other than him allah why do they not bring for them clear authority and who doe more wrong than he who invents lie against allah
Al-Kahf,55,0.7717,0.0,0.854,0.146,the young men said to one another and when you withdraw from them and that which they worship except allah then seek refuge in the cave your lord will open way for you from his mercy and will make easy for you your affair will give you what you will need of provision dwelling etc
Al-Kahf,77,0.3612,0.034,0.914,0.052,and you might have seen the sun when it rose declining to the right from their cave and when it set turning away from them to the left while they lay in the midst of the cave that is one of the ayat proof evidence sign of allah he whom allah guide is rightly guided but he whom he sends astray for him you will find no wali guiding friend to lead him to the right path
Al-Kahf,78,0.5859,0.0,0.94,0.06,and you would have thought them awake while they were asleep and we turned them on their right and on their left side and their dog stretching forth his two foreleg at the entrance of the cave or in the space near to the entrance of the cave a guard at the gate had you looked at them you would certainly have turned back from them in flight and would certainly have been filled with awe of them
Al-Kahf,94,0.6705,0.041,0.873,0.085,likewise we awakened them from their long deep sleep that they might question one another speaker from among them said how long have you stayed here they said we have stayed perhaps day or part of day they said your lord alone know best how long you have stayed here so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him find out which is the good lawful food and bring some of that to you and let him be careful and let no man know of you
Al-Kahf,35,-0.94,0.321,0.679,0.0,for if they come to know of you they will stone you to death or abuse and harm you or turn you back to their religion and in that case you will never be successful
Al-Kahf,77,0.8442,0.078,0.756,0.166,and thus we made their case known to the people that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that there can be no doubt about the hour remember when they the people of the city disputed among themselves about their case they said construct building over them their lord know best about them then those who won their point said most probably the disbeliever we verily shall build place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,91,0.765,0.0,0.91,0.09,some say they were three the dog being the fourth among them others say they were five the dog being the sixth guessing at the unseen yet others say they were seven the dog being the eighth say muhammad saw my lord know best their number none know them but few so debate not about their number etc except with the clear proof which we have revealed to you and consult not any of them people of the scripture jew and christian about the affair of the people of the cave
Al-Kahf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and never say of anything shall do such and such thing tomorrow
Al-Kahf,31,0.1027,0.057,0.873,0.069,except with the saying if allah will and remember your lord when you forget and say it may be that my lord guide me unto nearer way of truth than this
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they stayed in their cave three hundred solar year and add nine for lunar year
Al-Kahf,54,0.8595,0.063,0.742,0.195,say allah know best how long they stayed with him is the knowledge of the unseen of the heaven and the earth how clearly he see and hears everything they have no wali helper disposer of affair protector etc other than him and he make none to share in his decision and his rule
Al-Kahf,50,0.34,0.0,0.952,0.048,and recite what ha been revealed to you muhammad saw of the book the quran of your lord recite it understand and follow it teaching and act on it order and preach it to men none can change his word and none will you find a refuge other than him
Al-Kahf,80,0.765,0.026,0.872,0.102,and keep yourself muhammad saw patiently with those who call on their lord your companion who remember their lord with glorification praising in prayer etc and other righteous deed etc morning and afternoon seeking his face and let not your eye overlook them desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world and obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance one who follows his own lust and whose affair deed ha been lost
Al-Kahf,78,-0.3818,0.157,0.682,0.161,and say the truth is from your lord then whosoever will let him believe and whosoever will let him disbelieve verily we have prepared for the zalimun polytheist and wrong doer etc fire whose wall will be surrounding them disbeliever in the oneness of allah and if they ask for help relief water etc they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their face terrible the drink and an evil murtafaqa dwelling resting place etc
Al-Kahf,32,0.892,0.056,0.63,0.314,verily a for those who believe and do righteous deed certainly we shall not suffer to be lost the reward of anyone who doe his righteous deed in the most perfect manner
Al-Kahf,56,0.9531,0.0,0.718,0.282,these for them will be adn eden paradise everlasting garden wherein river flow underneath them therein they will be adorned with bracelet of gold and they will wear green garment of fine and thick silk they will recline therein on raised throne how good is the reward and what an excellent murtafaqa dwelling resting place etc
Al-Kahf,39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and put forward to them the example of two men unto one of them we had given two garden of grape and we had surrounded both with date palm and had put between them green crop cultivated field etc
Al-Kahf,28,-0.5106,0.109,0.891,0.0,each of those two garden brought forth it produce and failed not in the least therein and we caused river to gush forth in the midst of them
Al-Kahf,35,0.836,0.0,0.782,0.218,and he had property or fruit and he said to his companion in the course of mutual talk am more than you in wealth and stronger in respect of men see tafsir qurtubi vol page
Al-Kahf,25,-0.2263,0.115,0.801,0.084,and he went into his garden while in state of pride and disbelief unjust to himself he said think not that this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,32,0.7003,0.0,0.838,0.162,and think not the hour will ever come and if indeed am brought back to my lord on the day of resurrection surely shall find better than this when return to him
Al-Kahf,41,-0.3182,0.097,0.858,0.045,his companion said to him during the talk with him do you disbelieve in him who created you out of dust your father adam then out of nutfah mixed semen drop of male and female discharge then fashioned you into man
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but a for my part believe that he is allah my lord and none shall associate a partner with my lord
Al-Kahf,38,0.6858,0.037,0.817,0.146,it wa better for you to say when you entered your garden that which allah will will come to pas there is no power but with allah if you see me le than you in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,32,0.4404,0.0,0.914,0.086,it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and will send on it husban torment bolt etc from the sky then it will be slippery earth
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or the water thereof of the garden becomes deep sunken underground so that you will never be able to seek it
Al-Kahf,45,-0.8555,0.226,0.717,0.057,so his fruit were encircled with ruin and he remained clapping his hand with sorrow over what he had spent upon it while it wa all destroyed on it trellis he could only say would had ascribed no partner to my lord tafsir ibn kathir
Al-Kahf,19,0.5719,0.091,0.664,0.245,and he had no group of men to help him against allah nor could he defend or save himself
Al-Kahf,49,0.8216,0.084,0.668,0.248,there on the day of resurrection al walayah the protection power authority and kingdom will be for allah alone the true god he allah is the best for reward and the best for the final end la ilaha ill allah none ha the right to be worshipped but allah
Al-Kahf,59,-0.4118,0.065,0.881,0.054,and put forward to them the example of the life of this world it is like the water rain which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and becomes fresh and green but later it becomes dry and broken piece which the wind scatter and allah is able to do everything
Al-Kahf,52,0.9942,0.0,0.445,0.555,wealth and child are the adornment of the life of this world but the good righteous deed five compulsory prayer deed of allah obedience good and nice talk remembrance of allah with glorification praise and thanks etc that last are better with your lord for reward and better in respect of hope
Al-Kahf,41,0.2551,0.036,0.903,0.061,and remember the day we shall cause the mountain to pas away like cloud of dust and you will see the earth a levelled plain and we shall gather them all together so a to leave not one of them behind
Al-Kahf,44,-0.3182,0.066,0.898,0.035,and they will be set before your lord in line a row and allah will say now indeed you have come to u a we created you the first time nay but you thought that we had appointed no meeting for you with u
Al-Kahf,93,-0.4118,0.13,0.757,0.114,and the book one record will be placed in the right hand for believer in the oneness of allah and in the left hand for disbeliever in the oneness of allah and you will see the mujrimun criminal polytheist sinner etc fearful of that which is recorded therein they will say woe to u what sort of book is this that leaf neither small thing nor big thing but ha recorded it with number and they will find all that they did placed before them and your lord treat no one with injustice
Al-Kahf,66,-0.8625,0.148,0.82,0.032,and remember when we said to the angel prostrate to adam so they prostrated except iblis satan he wa one of the jinns he disobeyed the command of his lord will you then take him iblis and his offspring a protector and helper rather than me while they are enemy to you what an evil is the exchange for the zalimun polytheist and wrong doer etc
Al-Kahf,38,0.7678,0.051,0.725,0.224,allah made them iblis and his offspring not to witness nor took their help in the creation of the heaven and the earth and not even their own creation nor wa allah to take the misleader a helper
Al-Kahf,45,-0.9455,0.271,0.729,0.0,and remember the day he will say call those so called partner of mine whom you pretended then they will cry unto them but they will not answer them and we shall put maubiqa barrier or enmity or destruction or valley in hell between them
Al-Kahf,28,-0.743,0.237,0.712,0.05,and the mujrimun criminal polytheist sinner shall see the fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein and they will find no way of escape from there
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and indeed we have put forth every kind of example in this quran for mankind but man is ever more quarrelsome than anything
Al-Kahf,49,-0.1083,0.09,0.827,0.083,and nothing prevents men from believing now when the guidance the quran ha come to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that the way of the ancient be repeated with them their destruction decreed by allah or the torment be brought to them face to face
Al-Kahf,52,-0.7184,0.229,0.617,0.154,and we send not the messenger except a giver of glad tidings and warner but those who disbelieve dispute with false argument in order to refute the truth thereby and they treat my ayat proof evidence verse lesson sign revelation etc and that with which they are warned a jest and mockery
Al-Kahf,72,0.7878,0.028,0.87,0.103,and who doe more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayat proof evidence verse lesson sign revelation etc of his lord but turn away from them forgetting what deed his hand have sent forth truly we have set veil over their heart lest they should understand this the quran and in their ear deafness and if you muhammad saw call them to guidance even then they will never be guided
Al-Kahf,42,0.2374,0.101,0.739,0.161,and your lord is most forgiving owner of mercy were he to call them to account for what they have earned then surely he would have hastened their punishment but they have their appointed time beyond which they will find no escape
Al-Kahf,21,-0.875,0.357,0.643,0.0,and these town population ad thamud etc we destroyed when they did wrong and we appointed fixed time for their destruction
Al-Kahf,31,0.0258,0.0,0.965,0.035,and remember when musa moses said to his boy servant will not give up travelling until reach the junction of the two sea or until spend year and year in travelling
Al-Kahf,25,0.1531,0.0,0.935,0.065,but when they reached the junction of the two sea they forgot their fish and it took it way through the sea a in tunnel
Al-Kahf,33,-0.3182,0.14,0.782,0.078,so when they had passed further on beyond that fixed place musa moses said to his boy servant bring u our morning meal truly we have suffered much fatigue in this our journey
Al-Kahf,36,-0.5499,0.118,0.882,0.0,he said do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock indeed forgot the fish none but shaitan satan made me forget to remember it it took it course into the sea in strange way
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,musa moses said that is what we have been seeking so they went back retracing their footstep
Al-Kahf,23,0.3612,0.0,0.889,0.111,then they found one of our slave unto whom we had bestowed mercy from u and whom we had taught knowledge from u
Al-Kahf,29,0.4215,0.0,0.909,0.091,musa moses said to him khidr may follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge guidance and true path which you have been taught by allah

Al-Kahf,26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,khidr said this is the parting between me and you will tell you the interpretation of those thing over which you were unable to hold patience

Al-Kahf,20,0.6597,0.0,0.769,0.231,so we intended that their lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy
Al-Kahf,74,0.8442,0.0,0.871,0.129,and a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the town and there wa under it treasure belonging to them and their father wa righteous man and your lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure a mercy from your lord and did it not of my own accord that is the interpretation of those thing over which you could not hold patience

Al-Qasas,25,-0.4939,0.118,0.882,0.0,and to establish them in the land and we let fir aun pharaoh and haman and their host receive from them that which they feared
Al-Qasas,46,-0.8694,0.198,0.763,0.038,and we inspired the mother of musa moses saying suckle him musa moses but when you fear for him then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve verily we shall bring him back to you and shall make him one of our messenger
Al-Qasas,32,-0.7717,0.183,0.817,0.0,then the household of fir aun pharaoh picked him up that he might become for them an enemy and cause of grief verily fir aun pharaoh haman and their host were sinner
Al-Qasas,43,0.128,0.096,0.757,0.147,and the wife of fir aun pharaoh said comfort of the eye for me and for you kill him not perhaps he may be of benefit to u or we may adopt him a son and they perceive not the result of that
Al-Qasas,51,-0.0854,0.077,0.871,0.052,and the heart of the mother of musa moses became empty from every thought except the thought of musa moses she wa very near to disclose his case the child is her son had we not strengthened her heart with faith so that she might remain a one of the believer

Al-Qasas,47,0.926,0.0,0.761,0.239,and when he attained his full strength and wa perfect in manhood we bestowed on him hukman prophethood right judgement of the affair and religious knowledge of the religion of his forefather islamic monotheism and thus do we reward the muhsinun good doer see the footnote of
Al-Qasas,74,-0.9211,0.228,0.685,0.087,and he entered the city at time of unawareness of it people and he found there two men fighting one of his party his religion from the child of israel and the other of his foe the man of his own party asked him for help against his foe so musa moses struck him with his fist and killed him he said this is of shaitan satan doing verily he is plain misleading enemy

Al-Qasas,54,-0.7814,0.136,0.864,0.0,then when he decided to seize the man who wa an enemy to both of them the man said musa moses is it your intention to kill me a you killed man yesterday your aim is nothing but to become tyrant in the land and not to be one of those who do right
Al-Qasas,40,0.2895,0.097,0.741,0.162,and there came man running from the farthest end of the city he said musa moses verily the chief are taking counsel together about you to kill you so escape truly am to you of those who give sincere advice
Al-Qasas,27,-0.4767,0.188,0.716,0.096,so he escaped from there looking about in state of fear he said my lord save me from the people who are zalimun polytheist and wrong doer
Al-Qasas,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when he went towards the land of madyan midian he said it may be that my lord guide me to the right way
Al-Qasas,60,0.0258,0.0,0.982,0.018,and when he arrived at the water of madyan midian he found there group of men watering their flock and besides them he found two woman who were keeping back their flock he said what is the matter with you they said we cannot water our flock until the shepherd take their flock and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,29,0.7003,0.0,0.823,0.177,so he watered their flock for them then he turned back to shade and said my lord truly am in need of whatever good that you bestow on me
Al-Qasas,60,-0.5106,0.12,0.825,0.055,then there came to him one of the two woman walking shyly she said verily my father call you that he may reward you for having watered our flock for u so when he came to him and narrated the story he said fear you not you have escaped from the people who are zalimun polytheist disbeliever and wrong doer
Al-Qasas,26,0.9022,0.0,0.674,0.326,and said one of them the two woman my father hire him verily the best of men for you to hire is the strong the trustworthy
Al-Qasas,54,0.1901,0.053,0.882,0.065,he said intend to wed one of these two daughter of mine to you on condition that you serve me for eight year but if you complete ten year it will be favour from you but intend not to place you under difficulty if allah will you will find me one of the righteous
Al-Qasas,32,-0.25,0.152,0.722,0.126,he musa moses said that is settled between me and you whichever of the two term fulfill there will be no injustice to me and allah is surety over what we say
Al-Qasas,50,-0.3612,0.127,0.791,0.083,then when musa moses had fulfilled the term and wa travelling with his family he saw fire in the direction of tur mount he said to his family wait have seen fire perhaps may bring to you from there some information or burning fire brand that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,40,0.4877,0.053,0.823,0.124,so when he reached it the fire he wa called from the right side of the valley in the blessed place from the tree musa moses verily am allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
Al-Qasas,41,-0.296,0.095,0.837,0.068,and throw your stick but when he saw it moving a if it were snake he turned in flight and looked not back it wa said musa moses draw near and fear not verily you are of those who are secure
Al-Qasas,75,0.886,0.092,0.705,0.203,put your hand in your bosom it will come forth white without disease and draw your hand close to your side to be free from fear that which you suffered from the snake and also by that your hand will return to it original state these are two burhan sign miracle evidence proof from your lord to fir aun pharaoh and his chief verily they are the people who are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
Al-Qasas,16,-0.9246,0.488,0.512,0.0,he said my lord have killed man among them and fear that they will kill me
Al-Qasas,30,-0.2023,0.098,0.828,0.074,and my brother harun aaron he is more eloquent in speech than me so send him with me a helper to confirm me verily fear that they will belie me
Al-Qasas,47,-0.0258,0.07,0.842,0.088,allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and give you both power so they shall not be able to harm you with our ayat proof evidence verse lesson sign revelation etc you two a well a those who follow you will be the victor
Al-Qasas,37,0.2023,0.0,0.952,0.048,then when musa moses came to them with our clear ayat proof evidence verse lesson sign revelation etc they said this is nothing but invented magic never did we hear of this among our father of old
Al-Qasas,41,0.4075,0.121,0.724,0.155,musa moses said my lord know best him who came with guidance from him and whose will be the happy end in the hereafter verily the zalimun wrong doer polytheist and disbeliever in the oneness of allah will not be successful
Al-Qasas,66,-0.3612,0.079,0.862,0.058,fir aun pharaoh said chief know not that you have an ilah god other than me so kindle for me fire haman to bake brick out of clay and set up for me sarhan lofty tower or palace etc in order that may look at or look for the ilah god of musa moses and verily think that he musa moses is one of the liar
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.138,0.862,0.0,and he and his host were arrogant in the land without right and they thought that they would never return to u
Al-Qasas,52,-0.8834,0.174,0.826,0.0,so we seized him and his host and we threw them all into the sea and drowned them so behold muhammad saw what wa the end of the zalimun wrong doer polytheist and those who disbelieved in the oneness of their lord allah or rejected the advice of his messenger musa moses
Al-Qasas,20,-0.0258,0.106,0.793,0.101,and we made them leader inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
Al-Qasas,37,-0.5994,0.2,0.661,0.139,and we made curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be among al maqbuhun those who are prevented to receive allah mercy or any good despised or destroyed etc
Al-Qasas,35,-0.1779,0.085,0.849,0.066,and indeed we gave musa moses after we had destroyed the generation of old the scripture the taurat torah a an enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy that they might remember or receive admonition
Al-Qasas,29,0.3818,0.0,0.915,0.085,and you muhammad saw were not on the western side of the mount when we made clear to musa moses the commandment and you were not among those present
Al-Qasas,44,0.2885,0.029,0.916,0.055,but we created generation after generation after musa moses and long were the age that passed over them and you muhammad saw were not dweller among the people of madyan midian reciting our verse to them but it is we who kept sending messenger
Al-Qasas,75,-0.3919,0.074,0.886,0.041,and you muhammad saw were not at the side of the tur mount when we did call it is said that allah called the follower of muhammad saw and they answered his call or that allah called musa moses but you are sent a mercy from your lord to give warning to people to whom no warner had come before you in order that they may remember or receive admonition tafsir at tabari vol page
Al-Qasas,58,0.4939,0.0,0.946,0.054,and if we had not sent you to the people of makkah in case calamity should seize them for the deed that their hand have sent forth they should have said our lord why did you not send u messenger we should then have followed your ayat verse of the quran and should have been among the believer
Al-Qasas,70,0.8185,0.034,0.822,0.144,but when the truth muhammad saw with his message ha come to them from u they say why is he not given the like of what wa given to musa moses did they not disbelieve in that which wa given to musa moses of old they say two kind of magic the taurat torah and the quran each helping the other and they say verily in both we are disbeliever
Al-Qasas,31,0.7096,0.0,0.831,0.169,say to them muhammad saw then bring book from allah which is better guide than these two the taurat torah and the quran that may follow it if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,59,-0.631,0.067,0.933,0.0,but if they answer you not do not believe in your doctrine of islamic monotheism nor follow you then know that they only follow their own lust and who is more astray than one who follows his own lust without guidance from allah verily allah guide not the people who are zalimun wrong doer disobedient to allah and polytheist
