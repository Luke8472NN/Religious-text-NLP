Al-Baqarah,51,0.5574,0.048,0.839,0.113,just recall the time when your lord said to the angel am going to appoint vicegerent on the earth they humbly enquired are you going to appoint such one a will cause disorder and shed blood on the earth we are already engaged in hymning your praise and hallowing your name
Al-Baqarah,48,-0.4019,0.054,0.946,0.0,allah replied know what you do not know after this he taught adam the name of all thing then he set these before the angel and asked tell me the name of these thing if you are right in thinking that the appointment of vicegerent will cause disorder
Al-Baqarah,32,0.6705,0.155,0.605,0.24,they replied glory be to you you alone are free from defect we posse only that much knowledge which you have given u indeed you alone are all knowing and all wise
Al-Baqarah,51,0.5994,0.031,0.868,0.101,then allah said to adam tell them the name of these thing when adam told them the name of all those thing allah declared did not tell you that know those truth about the earth and the heaven which are hidden from you know what you disclose and what you hide
Al-Baqarah,24,0.4109,0.095,0.75,0.155,then we commanded the angel bow yourselves to adam all bowed but iblis refused to do so he waxed proud and joined the defiers
Al-Baqarah,35,0.0644,0.0,0.965,0.035,then we said adam you and your wife both dwell in the garden and eat to your heart content where from you will but do not go near this tree otherwise you shall become transgressor

Al-Baqarah,42,-0.9274,0.264,0.736,0.0,recall the time when we delivered you from the slavery of pharaoh people they had inflicted dreadful torment on you they killed your son and let your daughter live and in this there wa hard trial for you from your your lord
Al-Baqarah,29,-0.1779,0.114,0.792,0.094,remember the time when we parted the sea to make way for you and let you pas safely through it and then drowned pharaoh people before your very eye
Al-Baqarah,30,-0.0258,0.098,0.778,0.124,call to mind that when we invited moses for fixed term of forty night and day you took to calf worship in his absence though you had committed wicked transgression
Al-Baqarah,13,0.5994,0.0,0.692,0.308,yet we pardoned you even after that so that you might become grateful
Al-Baqarah,32,-0.7525,0.182,0.783,0.035,remember that at that very time when you were committing this gross iniquity we gave moses the book and the criterion of right and wrong so that you might be guided aright
Al-Baqarah,66,0.765,0.103,0.713,0.184,remember that when moses returned with the divine gift he said to his people my people you have wronged yourselves grievously by taking the calf for worship therefore turn to your creator in penitence and slay the guilty one among you this is best for you in the sight of your creator at that time your creator accepted your repentance because he is relenting and merciful
Al-Baqarah,39,-0.3102,0.056,0.944,0.0,remember when you said moses we are not going to believe you until we see with our own eye allah talking to you at that very time thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on and you fell lifeless
Al-Baqarah,15,0.7096,0.0,0.688,0.312,then we raised you to life so that you might become grateful for this favour
Al-Baqarah,51,0.4031,0.078,0.796,0.126,remember that we caused the cloud to overshadow you and provided you with manna and salva for your food saying eat of the clean and pure thing we have bestowed upon you in spite of this your forefather violated our command however they did not harm u but harmed only themselves
Al-Baqarah,47,0.6956,0.084,0.734,0.182,then call to mind the time when we said go into the town before you and eat to your heart content therein wherefrom you will but enter the gate bowing down with humility repeating hittatun we will forgive your sin and increase the reward of the righteous
Al-Baqarah,35,-0.9253,0.28,0.72,0.0,but the transgressor perverted the word said to them entirely into different thing so we sent down upon the transgressor severe torment from the sky that wa the punishment for the disobedience they were showing
Al-Baqarah,56,0.4867,0.025,0.896,0.079,remember that when moses prayed for water for his people we answered strike the rock with your staff whereupon twelve spring gushed forth from it the people of every clan came to know their drinking place then they were enjoined eat and drink of what allah ha provided and do not spread disorder on the earth
Al-Baqarah,121,-0.957,0.167,0.786,0.047,remember you grumbled moses we cannot endure one and the same sort of food pray your lord to bring for u the product of the earth green herb vegetable corn garlic onion pulse and the like moses replied what would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler well go and live in town and you will get there what you demand by and by they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred allah wrath that wa because they began to reject the revelation of allah and kill his messenger without any just cause that wa the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the law
Al-Baqarah,46,0.128,0.149,0.693,0.158,rest assured that whosoever from among the muslim or the jew or the christian or the sabaeans belief in allah and the last day and performs good deed he will have his reward with his lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief
Al-Baqarah,54,0.6369,0.0,0.909,0.091,call to mind the time when we raised above you the tur and made covenant with you saying hold fast to the book which we are giving you and bear in mind the command and precept contained therein it is expected that this will lead you on to the path of virtue and piety
Al-Baqarah,29,-0.6528,0.206,0.706,0.088,but even after that you forsook the covenant nevertheless allah did not withhold his grace and mercy from you otherwise you would have been utterly ruined long before this
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.8225,0.305,0.629,0.066,and you know well the story of those among you who broke sabbath we said to them be ape despised and hated by all
Al-Baqarah,22,-0.2023,0.207,0.612,0.18,thus we made their end warning to the people of their time and succeeding generation and an admonition for god fearing people
Al-Baqarah,39,0.1027,0.052,0.887,0.062,then call to mind the other event when moses said to his people allah command you to sacrifice cow they replied do you mean to have jest with u he answered crave allah protection from behaving like ignorant people
Al-Baqarah,40,0.1655,0.0,0.957,0.043,then they said please make request to your lord to give u some detail of the cow moses answered allah say that the cow should neither be old nor immature but of middle age do therefore a you are bidden
Al-Baqarah,40,0.9513,0.0,0.681,0.319,but they further asked please request your lord to make it clear to u of what colour she should be moses answered he say that she should be of yellow colour so deep and bright a to delight the beholder
Al-Baqarah,35,0.5267,0.0,0.876,0.124,again they said pray your lord to specify for u the kind of cow that is required for cow of this type look alike to u we shall then find her if god so will
Al-Baqarah,55,0.1531,0.031,0.909,0.059,moses answered allah say that she should be cow which ha not been yoked nor ha ploughed the land nor watered the field which is sound and whole without belemish then they cried out now you have given an accurate description then they sacrificed her but they did not appear to be doing this willingly
Al-Baqarah,38,-0.7311,0.193,0.807,0.0,you should also recall to mind another incident you slew man and began to dispute about the murder and accuse one another of it but allah had decreed that what you were trying to hide should be disclosed
Al-Baqarah,34,-0.9345,0.321,0.679,0.0,so we commanded strike the corpse of the murdered man with part of the sacrificed cow see how allah brings the dead to life and show you his sign so that you may understand
Al-Baqarah,63,-0.6139,0.09,0.882,0.029,but even after seeing these sign your heart hardened and became a hard a rock nay even harder than rock for there are some rock out of which spring gush forth and others which split open and water issue out of them then there are some which tumble down for fear of allah and allah is not unaware of what you are doing
Al-Baqarah,42,0.5859,0.043,0.812,0.145,muslim do you then expect that these people will accept your invitation and become believer whereas there have always been among them some who have been hearing the word of god understanding it well and then perverting and tampering with it knowingly
Al-Baqarah,56,0.0772,0.048,0.9,0.053,when they meet those who believe in muhammad they say we also believe in him but when they meet one another in private they say have you got no sense that you disclose to them those thing which allah ha revealed to you so that they might bring them a proof against you before your lord
Al-Baqarah,18,-0.1779,0.091,0.909,0.0,do they really not know that allah is fully aware of what they hide and what they disclose
Al-Baqarah,30,0.2617,0.11,0.779,0.111,then there are among them some un lettered people who have no knowledge of the book but depend upon empty hope and are guided by mere conjecture and guess work
Al-Baqarah,58,0.4963,0.135,0.687,0.178,so woe to their learned people who write the law with their own hand and then say to the people this is from allah so that they might gain some paltry worldly end they do not see that this writing of their hand will bring woe to them and what they gain thereby will lead to their ruin
Al-Baqarah,59,-0.9136,0.202,0.765,0.033,they also say the fire of hell is not going to touch u and even if it doe at all it will be only for few day say have you obtained promise from allah which he would not break or do you attribute to allah thing you do not know why will not the fire of hell touch you
Al-Baqarah,18,-0.9531,0.535,0.414,0.051,whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in sin shall be doomed to hell and abide therein for ever
Al-Baqarah,21,0.4939,0.0,0.819,0.181,only those people who believe and do good deed will be the dweller of the garden and live there for ever
Al-Baqarah,66,-0.529,0.125,0.825,0.05,remember that we made solemn covenant with the child of israel to this effect worship none save allah be good to your parent to your relative to the orphan and to the helpless speak aright with the people establish the salat and pay the zakat but with the exception of few you all slid back from it and are paying no heed to it even now
Al-Baqarah,34,0.2746,0.036,0.896,0.067,remember also that we made another solemn covenant with you you shall not shed blood among yourselves nor expel one another from your home and you confirmed it and you are witness to it
Al-Baqarah,97,-0.9819,0.237,0.747,0.016,but inspite of this you are killing your brother and driving them out from their home and making unjust and aggressive alliance against one another and when they come to you a captive you trade on their ransom whereas their expulsion itself wa unlawful for you do you then believe in one part of the scripture and disbelieve in the other what other punishment do such people from among you deserve except an ignominious life in this world and the most grievous doom on the day of resurrection allah is not unaware of what you are doing
Al-Baqarah,33,-0.3089,0.066,0.934,0.0,these are the people who have preferred the worldly life to the life in the hereafter therefore their torment shall not be lightened nor shall help be given to them from any quarter
Al-Baqarah,61,0.7845,0.032,0.805,0.163,and we gave moses the book and sent after him train of messenger in succession then we sent jesus son of mary with clear sign and supported him with the holy spirit then how is it that whenever messenger came to you wish that which did not suit your lust you grew rebellious against him and repudiated some and slew others
Al-Baqarah,25,0.5859,0.0,0.827,0.173,they say our heart are secure nay the fact is that allah ha cursed them for their disbelief so they are little disposed to believe
Al-Baqarah,64,-0.4767,0.095,0.839,0.066,and how are they behaving now towards book which ha come to them from allah inspite of the fact that it confirms the scripture which they already possessed and inspite of the fact that before it came they used to pray for signal victory over the disbeliever they rejected it when it came although they recognized it may allah curse be upon such disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,56,-0.1531,0.087,0.836,0.077,what mean thing it is with which they delude their mind they reject the guidance which allah ha sent down merely because of their grudge why allah ha in his bounty sent it to whom he chose from amongst his servant they have thus incurred wrath after wrath and for such disbeliever there is disgraceful doom
Al-Baqarah,72,0.4404,0.088,0.765,0.147,when it is said to them believe in that which allah ha sent down they say we believe only in that which ha been sent to u and reject everything else though it is the truth and confirms what is with them well ask them if you sincerely believed in what wa sent down to you why did you kill the messenger of allah who were sent to you from amongst yourselves
Al-Baqarah,27,0.3818,0.071,0.774,0.155,more than that moses came to you with clear sign yet no sooner wa he away from you than you transgressed and took the calf for worship
Al-Baqarah,76,0.1406,0.093,0.796,0.11,recall also to mind the covenant we made with you while we raised the tur over you follow strictly the precept we are giving you and give ear to our commandment your forefather replied we have heard but we will not obey they were so prone to unbelief that they cherished the calf in their heart tell them muhammad if indeed you are believer yours is strange faith that enjoins you to do such evil thing
Al-Baqarah,36,-0.296,0.096,0.837,0.067,say to them if the abode of the hereafter with allah is exclusively reserved for you and not for the rest of mankind then you should long for death if you arc sincere in your claim
Al-Baqarah,36,-0.0408,0.059,0.886,0.055,believe it that they will never wish for it for they are fully aware of the consequence of what they have sent before them for the hereafter and allah know well the mentality of the transgressor
Al-Baqarah,53,-0.7351,0.126,0.874,0.0,you will find that of all mankind they are the greediest for life nay they are even greedier than the mushriks each one of them longs to have life of thousand year but long life can by no mean remove them away from the scourge for allah is watching whatever they are doing
Al-Baqarah,39,0.2263,0.078,0.802,0.12,say to them whoever is enemy to gabriel should understand that he ha by allah command revealed to your heart the qur an which confirms what wa revealed before it and brings guidance and glad tidings to the believer
Al-Baqarah,31,-0.7906,0.194,0.806,0.0,if their enmity to gabriel is due to this let them understand that whoever is enemy to allah his angel his messenger gabriel and michael allah is enemy to such disbeliever

Al-Baqarah,27,0.6705,0.0,0.82,0.18,ha it not always been so that every time they made covenant some of them set it aside nay most of them never believe in it sincerely
Al-Baqarah,38,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and whenever messenger came to them from allah confirming that scripture which they already possessed some from among the people of the book threw the book of allah behind their back a though they knew nothing about it
Al-Baqarah,191,-0.961,0.14,0.803,0.057,instead of this they began to follow that magic to which the devil falsely attributed the greatness of the kingdom of solomon in fact solomon wa never involved in any practice of disbelief but the satan who taught magic to the people were themselves guilty of disbelief they were after that thing which wa sent to harut and marut the two angel at babylon whenever these two angel taught black art to anyone they would always give clear warning beforehand saying we are merely trial for you so you should not commit blasphemy but in spite of this warning those people used to learn from the angel the art which caused division between husband and wife although it wa obvious that they could not do any harm to anyone by mean of this magic without allah permission yet they learnt that art which could not be profitable even for them but wa actually harmful moreover they knew it full well that anyone who purchased that art would have no share in the hereafter what vile commodity it wa for which they sold off their soul if they had but known it
Al-Baqarah,23,0.5106,0.0,0.83,0.17,had they believed in allah and practised piety they would have received far better reward from aiiah if they had but known it
Al-Baqarah,21,-0.8462,0.3,0.7,0.0,believer do not say ra ina but say unzurna and listen to what is said for the disbeliever deserve painful punishment

Al-Baqarah,36,0.6486,0.0,0.862,0.138,would you then ask your prophet such question a were asked of moses in former time in fact anyone who change the way of belief for that of disbelief ha surely swerved from the right way
Al-Baqarah,49,0.8999,0.035,0.71,0.255,many of the people of the book desire to turn you anyhow back to unbelief they wish this out of the envy of their heart though the truth ha become quite clear to them yet you should show forbearance and forgiveness to them till allah himself enforces his judgement

Al-Baqarah,59,-0.0418,0.066,0.871,0.063,the jew say that the christian have nothing of the truth and the christian say that the jew have nothing of it though both read the scripture and those who have no knowledge of the scripture also make similar claim allah will surely give his judgement on the day of resurrection in all the matter in which they differ
Al-Baqarah,64,-0.8714,0.201,0.712,0.088,and who could be greater wrongdoer than the one who forbids the mention of allah name in place of worship and strives for their ruin such people do not deserve to enter the place of worship and if they enter at all they should do so in fear for there is ignominy for them in this world and an awful punishment in the hereafter

Al-Anam,58,-0.9531,0.249,0.751,0.0,those who consider it lie that they will have to meet allah are indeed the loser so much so that when that hour come to them suddenly they will say ala for u how negligent we have been in this behalf they will carry their burden of sin on their back how evil is the burden they bear
Al-Anam,34,-0.3291,0.127,0.78,0.094,the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime and the life of the hereafter is far better for those who seek to ward off their ruin will you not then understand
Al-Anam,36,-0.8338,0.22,0.742,0.038,muhammad we know indeed that the thing they say grieve you though in truth it is not you whom they give the lie to but it is the sign of allah that these wrong doer reject
Al-Anam,51,-0.2197,0.112,0.791,0.097,messenger before you have been given the lie to and they endured with patience their being given the lie to and being persecuted until the time when our help reached them none ha the power to alter the word of allah indeed some account of the messenger ha already reached you
Al-Anam,52,0.2023,0.089,0.808,0.103,nevertheless if their turning away grief you then seek if you can either way down into the earth or ladder to the heaven and try to bring to them some sign had allah so willed he would have gathered them all to the true guidance do not then be among the ignorant
Al-Anam,28,-0.4588,0.136,0.791,0.073,only they who listen can respond to the call of the truth a for the dead allah will raise them and then to him they will be returned
Al-Anam,33,0.4118,0.045,0.807,0.149,and they say why ha no miraculous sign been sent down to him from his lord say surely allah ha the power to send down sign but most of them do not know
Al-Anam,40,-0.5499,0.166,0.765,0.069,there is no animal that crawl on the earth no bird that fly with it two wing but are community like you we have neglected nothing in the book of decree then to their lord will they all be mustered
Al-Anam,35,-0.7269,0.196,0.758,0.046,those who gave the lie to our sign are deaf and dumb and blunder about in darkness allah cause whomsoever he will to stray in error and set whomsoever he will on the straight way
Al-Anam,30,-0.2023,0.093,0.838,0.069,say what do you think if some chastisement of allah or the hour suddenly overtakes you do you cry to any other than allah answer if you speak the truth
Al-Anam,37,-0.9001,0.289,0.711,0.0,lo it is to him alone that you cry and then if he so will he remove the distress for which you had cried to him then you forget the partner you had set up with allah
Al-Anam,29,-0.3182,0.078,0.922,0.0,and we did indeed send messenger to other nation before you and then we seized those nation with misfortune and hardship so that they might humble themselves before u
Al-Anam,27,0.4497,0.0,0.894,0.106,but when misfortune befell them from u why did they not humble themselves their heart had hardened and satan had made their deed seem fair to them
Al-Anam,39,0.4019,0.053,0.831,0.115,so when they forgot what they had been reminded of we opened the gate of all thing so that while they rejoiced in what they had been granted we seized them suddenly and they were plunged into utter despair
Al-Anam,27,-0.128,0.156,0.734,0.11,thus the last remnant of those wrongdoing people wa cut off all praise is for allah the lord of the entire universe for having punished them so
Al-Anam,50,0.5106,0.0,0.918,0.082,say muhammad what do you think if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your heart who is the god other than allah who could restore them to you behold how we put forth our sign in diverse form and yet they turn away from them
Al-Anam,22,-0.743,0.24,0.76,0.0,say if the chastisement of allah were to overtake you unawares or openly shall any except the wrong doing people be destroyed
Al-Anam,32,-0.0557,0.144,0.718,0.138,we do not send messenger except a bearer of glad tidings and warner so he who belief in their message and mend his conduct need have no fear and need not grieve
Al-Anam,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,whereas those who give the lie to our sign chastisement will visit them for their transgression
Al-Anam,55,-0.1027,0.047,0.897,0.057,muhammad say do not say to you have the treasure of allah nor do have knowledge of what is beyond the reach of human perception nor do say to you am an angel only follow what is revealed to me then ask them are the blind and the seeing alike do you not then reflect
Al-Anam,39,-0.7351,0.187,0.766,0.047,and warn with this revealed message those who fear that they shall be mustered to their lord that there will be none apart from allah to act a their protector and intercessor then maybe they will become god fearing
Al-Anam,53,-0.4215,0.127,0.811,0.062,and do not drive away those who invoke their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his pleasure all the time you are by no mean accountable for them just a they are by no mean accountable for you if you still drive them away you will become among the wrong doer
Al-Anam,38,0.8716,0.04,0.703,0.257,thus we have made some of them mean for testing others so that they should say are these theones among u upon whom allah ha bestowed his favour yes doe allah not know well who are the thankful
Al-Anam,51,0.802,0.093,0.685,0.221,and when those who believe in our sign come to you say to them peace be upon you your lord ha made mercy incumbent upon himself so that if anyone of you doe bad deed out of ignorance and thereafter repents and make amends surely you will find him all forgiving
Al-Anam,17,-0.1779,0.161,0.711,0.128,thus we clearly set forth our sign so that the way of the wicked might become distinct
Al-Anam,39,-0.6197,0.12,0.88,0.0,say muhanimad have been forbidden to serve those to whom you call other than allah say do not follow your desire for were to do that would go astray and would not be of those who are rightly guided
Al-Anam,47,0.8689,0.036,0.753,0.211,say take stand upon clear evidence from my lord and it is that which you have given the lie to that which you desire to be hastened is not within my power judgement lie with allah alone he declares the truth and he is the best judge
Al-Anam,32,0.3506,0.134,0.696,0.17,say if what you demand so hastily were in my power the matter between me and you would have been long decided but allah know best how to judge the wrong doer
Al-Anam,68,0.6956,0.033,0.843,0.124,he ha the key to the realm that lie beyond the reach of human perception none know them but he and he know what is on the land and in the sea there is not leaf which fall that he doe not know about and there is not grain in the darkness of the earth or anything green or dry which ha not been recorded in clear book
Al-Anam,48,0.4215,0.0,0.944,0.056,he recall your soul by night and know what you do by day and then he raise you back each day in order that the term appointed by him is fulfilled then to him you will return whereupon he will let you know what you have been doing

Al-Anam,23,0.6369,0.0,0.802,0.198,then all are restored to allah their true protector behold his is the judgement he is the swiftest of those who take account
Al-Anam,58,0.8042,0.114,0.686,0.2,ask them muhammad who is it that delivers you from danger in the deep darkness of the land and the sea and to whom do you call in humility and in the secrecy of your heart to whom do you pray if he will but save u from this distress we shall most certainly be among the thankful
Al-Anam,24,-0.1779,0.179,0.698,0.123,say it is allah alone who delivers you from this and from every distress and yet you associate others with allah in his divinity
Al-Anam,55,-0.4588,0.107,0.817,0.075,say it is he who ha the power to send forth chastisement upon you from above you or from beneath your foot or split you into hostile group and make some of you taste each others violence behold how we set forth our sign in diverse form so that maybe they will understand the truth
Al-Anam,17,-0.1531,0.144,0.743,0.114,your people have denied it even though it is the truth say am not guardian over you
Al-Anam,13,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,every tiding ha it appointed time you yourselves will soon know the end
Al-Anam,46,-0.3182,0.099,0.848,0.053,when you see those who are engaged in blasphemy against our sign turn away from them until they begin to talk of other thing and should satan ever cause you to forget then do not remain after recollection in the company of those wrong doing people
Al-Anam,29,-0.8481,0.275,0.668,0.056,for those who are god fearing are by no mean accountable for the others except that it is their duty to adinonish them maybe then they will shun evil
Al-Anam,98,-0.8004,0.122,0.821,0.057,leave alone those who have made sport and pastime of their religion and whom the life of the world ha beguiled but continue to admonish them with the qur an lest man should be caught for what he ha himself earned for there shall neither be any protector nor intercessor apart from allah and though he may offer any conceivable ransom it shall not be accepted from him for such people have been caught for the deed that they have themselves earned boiling water to drink and painful chastisement to suffer for their unbelief is what awaits them
Al-Anam,83,0.8294,0.094,0.712,0.193,ask them muharnmad shall we invoke apart from allah something that can neither benefit nor harm u and thus be turned back on our heel after allah ha guided u like the one whom the evil one have lured into bewilderment in the earth even though he ha friend who call him to true guidance saying come to u say surely allah guidance is the only true guidance and we have been commanded to submit ourselves to the lord of the entire universe
Al-Anam,21,-0.4939,0.138,0.862,0.0,and to establish prayer and to have fear of him it is to him that all of you shall be gathered
Al-Anam,73,0.9393,0.0,0.772,0.228,and he it is who ha created the heaven and the earth in truth and the very day he will say be resurrection there will be his word is the truth and his will be the dominion on the day when the trumpet is blown he know all that lie beyond the reach of human perception a well a all that is visible to man he is the all wise the all aware
Al-Anam,23,-0.1531,0.105,0.814,0.081,and recall when abraham said to his father azar do you take idol for god see you and your people in obvious error
Al-Anam,113,0.8074,0.038,0.855,0.107,and thus we showed abraham the kingdom of the heaven and the earth so that he might become one of those who have sure faith the adversary are told that they can observe god sign in the phenomenon of the universe just a abraham could the difference is that they see nothing a if they were blind whereas abraham saw with open eye the sun moon and star which rise and set before their eye day after day and night after night witness them a misguided at their setting a at their rising yet the same sign were observed by the perceptive abraham and the physical phenomenon helped him arrive at the truth
Al-Anam,31,-0.6759,0.132,0.868,0.0,then when the night outspread over him he beheld star and said this is my lord but when it went down he said do not love the thing that go down
Al-Anam,39,-0.4782,0.076,0.924,0.0,then when he beheld the moon rising he said this is my lord but when it went down he said were that my lord did not guide me surely would have become among the people who have gone astray
Al-Anam,42,0.8908,0.0,0.786,0.214,then when he beheld the sun rising he said this is my lord this is the greatest of all then when it went down he said my people most certainly am quit of those whom you associate with allah in his divinity
Al-Anam,33,0.9169,0.0,0.668,0.332,behold have turned my face in exclusive devotion to the one who originated the heaven and the earth and am certainly not one of those who associate others with allah in his divinity
Al-Anam,60,0.8413,0.029,0.808,0.162,his people remonstrated with him whereupon abraharn said do you remonstrate with me concerning allah who ha guided me to the right way do not fear those whom you associate with allah in his divinity only that which my lord will indeed that alone will come by my lord embrace all thing within his knowledge will you not take heed
Al-Anam,54,0.8979,0.119,0.583,0.298,why should fear those whom you have associated with allah in his divinity when you do not fear associating others with allah in his divinity something for which he ha sent down to you no authority then which of the two party ha better title to security tell u if you have any knowledge
Al-Anam,29,-0.4646,0.161,0.769,0.071,those who believe and did not tarnish their faith with wrong doing for them there is security and it is they who have been guided to the right way
Al-Anam,27,0.5423,0.077,0.738,0.185,that wa our argument which we gave to abraham against his people we raise in rank whom we will truly your lord is all wise all knowing
Al-Anam,62,0.765,0.0,0.899,0.101,and we bestowed upon abraham offspring ishaq isaac and ya qub jacob and each of them did we guide to the right way a we had earlier guided noah to the right way and of his descendant we guided da ud david and sulayman solomon ayyub job yusuf joseph musa moses and harun aaron thus do we reward those who do good
Al-Anam,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and of his descendant we guided zakariya zachariah yahya john isa jesus and ilyas elia each one of them wa of the righteous
Al-Anam,27,0.4215,0.0,0.903,0.097,and of his descendant we guided isma il ishmael al yasa elisha yunus jonah and lut lot and each one of them we favoured over all mankind
Al-Anam,23,0.2263,0.0,0.921,0.079,and likewise we elected for our cause and guided on to straight way some of their forefather and their offspring and their brother
Al-Anam,36,0.3291,0.087,0.795,0.118,that is allah guidance wherewith he guide those of his servant whom he will but if they ever associated others with allah in his divinity then all that they had done would have gone to waste
Al-Anam,35,0.2903,0.057,0.855,0.087,those are the one to whom we gave the book and judgement and prophethood and if they refuse to believe in it now we will bestow this favour on people who do believe in it
Al-Anam,35,0.3612,0.057,0.848,0.095,muhammad those are the one allah guided to the right way follow then their way and say ask of you no reward for carrying on this mission it is merely an admonition to all mankind
Al-Anam,83,0.296,0.014,0.957,0.029,they did not form any proper estimate of allah when they said allah ha not revealed anything to any man ask them the book which moses brought a light and guidance for men and which you keep in bit and scrap some of which you disclose while the rest you conceal even though through it you were taught that which neither you nor your forefather knew who wa it who revealed it say allah and then leave them to sport with their argumentation
Al-Anam,52,0.6486,0.025,0.873,0.102,like that book this too is book which we have revealed full of blessing confirming what wa revealed before it so that you might warn the people of the mother of city makka and those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and are evermindful of their prayer
Al-Anam,89,-0.7,0.149,0.727,0.124,who can be more unjust than he who place lie on allah and who say revelation ha come to me when in fact nothing wa revealed to him and who say will produce the like of what allah ha revealed if you could but see the wrongdoer in the agony of death and the angel stretching out their hand saying yield up your soul today you will be recompensed with the chastisement of humiliation for the lie you spoke concerning allah and for you waxing proud against his sign
Al-Anam,81,-0.4939,0.086,0.864,0.049,and allah will say now you have come to u all alone even a we had created you in the first instance and you have left behind all that we had bestowed upon you in the world we do not see with you your intercessor whom you imagined to have share with allah in your affair you have now been cut off from one another and all those whom you imagined to be allah associate in your affair have failed you
Al-Anam,40,-0.8555,0.225,0.717,0.058,truly it is allah who cause the grain and the fruit kernel to sprout he brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living such is allah so whither are you tending in error
Al-Anam,37,0.5859,0.0,0.879,0.121,it is he who cause the dawn to split forth and ha ordained the night for repose and the sun and the moon for reckoning time all this is determined by allah the almighty the all knowing
Al-Anam,38,0.1027,0.05,0.891,0.059,it is he who ha made for you the star that you may follow the right direction in the darkness of the land and the sea we have indeed spelled out sign for the people who have knowledge
Al-Anam,33,0.25,0.0,0.941,0.059,it is he who created you out of single being and appointed for each of you time limit and resting place we have indeed spelled out our sign for those who can understand
Al-Anam,97,0.9001,0.0,0.886,0.114,and it is he who ha sent down water from the heaven and thereby we have brought vegetation of every kind and out of this we have brought forth green foliage and then from it close packed ear of corn and out of the palm tree from the sheath of it thick clustered date hanging down with heaviness and garden of vine and the olive tree and the pomegranate all resembling one another and yet so different behold their fruit when they bear fruit and ripen surely in all this there are sign for those who believe
Al-Anam,46,0.4939,0.049,0.84,0.111,and yet some people have come to associate the jinni with allah in his divinity even though it is he who created them and in ignorance they impute to him son and daughter he is holy and exalted far above that which they attribute to him
Al-Anam,34,0.8519,0.052,0.656,0.293,he is the originator of the heaven and the earth how can he have son when he ha had no mate and he ha created everything and he ha full knowledge of all thing
Al-Anam,29,-0.3716,0.13,0.821,0.049,such is allah your lord there is no god but he the creator of all thing serve him alone for it is he who is the guardian of everything
Al-Anam,21,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,no visual perception can encompass him even though he encompasses all visual perception he is the all subtle the all aware
Al-Anam,43,0.25,0.118,0.725,0.156,the light of clear perception have now come to you from your lord then he who chooses to see clearly doe so for his own good and he who chooses to remain blind doe so to his own harm am not your keeper
Al-Anam,37,0.7579,0.0,0.819,0.181,thus do we make our sign clear in diverse way that they might say you have learned this from somebody and we do this in order that we make the truth clear to the people of knowledge
Al-Anam,32,0.7184,0.057,0.729,0.214,muhammad follow the revelation which ha come to you from your lord other than whom there is no god and turn away from those who associate others with allah in his divinity
Al-Anam,30,0.5719,0.0,0.887,0.113,had allah so willed they would not have associated others with him in his divinity and we have not appointed you watcher over them and you are not their guardian
Al-Anam,51,-0.5574,0.105,0.854,0.041,do not revile those whom they invoke other than allah because they will revile allah in ignorance out of spite for we have indeed made the deed of every people seem fair to them tlen their return is to their lord and he will inform them of what they have done
Al-Anam,46,-0.101,0.097,0.854,0.049,they swear by allah with their most solemn oath that if sign come to them they will certainly believe in it say sign are in allah power alone what will make you realize that even if those sign were to come they would still not believe
Al-Anam,31,0.2732,0.038,0.889,0.073,we are turning their heart and eye away from the truth even a they did not believe in the first instance and we leave them in their insurgence to stumble blindly
Al-Anam,50,-0.7783,0.124,0.876,0.0,even if we had sent angel down to them and the dead had spoken to them and even if we had assembled before them all the thing face to face they would still not believe unless it be allah will that they believe most of them behave in utter ignorance
Al-Anam,53,-0.4404,0.126,0.813,0.061,and so it is that against every prophet we have set up the evil one from among men and jinni some of them inspire others with specious speech only by way of delusion had it been your lord will they would not have done it leave them alone to fabricate what they will
Al-Anam,41,0.4543,0.088,0.743,0.168,so that the heart of those who do not believe in the life to come might incline towards this attractive delusion and that they may be well pleased with it and might acquire the evil that they are bent on acquiring
Al-Anam,50,0.5423,0.047,0.826,0.127,shall look upon anyone apart from allah for judgement when it is he who ha revealed to you the book in detail and those whom we gave the book before you know that this book ha been revealed in truth by your lord do not then be among the doubter
Al-Anam,25,0.8225,0.067,0.636,0.297,the word of your lord is perfect in truthfulness and justice no one can change his word he is the all hearing the all knowing
Al-Anam,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,muhammad if you obey the majority of those who live on earth they will lead you away from allah path they only follow idle fancy indulging in conjecture
Al-Anam,17,0.2732,0.0,0.884,0.116,and your lord know well who stray from his path and also those who are rightly guided
Al-Anam,20,0.34,0.0,0.888,0.112,if you believe in the sign of allah eat the flesh of that over which allah name ha been pronounced
Al-Anam,58,0.6124,0.098,0.728,0.174,and how is it that you do not eat of that over which allah name ha been pronounced even though he ha clearly spelled out to you what he ha forbidden you unless you are constrained to it many indeed say misleading thing without knowledge driven merely by their lowly desire but your lord know well the transgressor
Al-Anam,23,-0.4767,0.23,0.607,0.163,abstain from sin be it either open or secret indeed those who commit sin shall surely be requited for all they have done
Al-Anam,68,0.8631,0.079,0.736,0.185,do not eat of the animal over which the name of allah ha not been pronounced at the time of it slaughtering for that is transgression and behold the evil one do inspire doubt and objection into the heart of their friend so that they dispute with you but if you obey them you will surely yourselves turn into those who associate others with allah in his divinity
Al-Anam,49,-0.3612,0.112,0.802,0.086,he who wa dead and whom we raised to life and we set light for him to walk among men is he like the one steeped in darkness out of which he doe not come out thus have their own doings been made to seem fair to the unbeliever
Al-Anam,31,-0.6124,0.183,0.739,0.078,thus we have appointed the leader of the wicked one in every land to weave their plot but in truth they plot only to their own harm without even realizing it
Al-Anam,52,-0.872,0.216,0.72,0.064,whenever there come to them sign from allah they say we will not believe until we are given what wa given to the messenger of allah allah know best where to place his message soon shall these wicked one meet with humiliation and severe chastigement from allah for all their evil plotting
Al-Anam,59,-0.2263,0.066,0.882,0.052,thus it is fact that whomsoever allah will to guide he open his breast for islam and whomsoever he will to let go astray he cause his breast to become strait and constricted a if he were climbing towards the heaven thus allah lay the abomination of flight from and hatred of islam on those who do not believe
Al-Anam,23,0.2263,0.0,0.921,0.079,even though this way is the straight way of your lord and we have distinguished it sign to those who heed to admonition
Al-Anam,19,0.5423,0.0,0.837,0.163,theirs shall be an abode of peace with their lord their protector in recompense for all they have done
Al-Anam,90,0.7717,0.071,0.782,0.147,and on the day when he shall muster them all together he will say to the jinni assembly of the jinni you have seduced good many of mankind and their companion from among the human will say our lord we did indeed benefit from one another and now have reached the term which you had set for u thereupon allah will say the fire is now your abode and therein you shall abide only those whom allah will shall escape the fire surely your lord is all wise all knowing
Al-Anam,24,-0.6486,0.237,0.662,0.101,in this manner we shall make the wrong doer friend of each other in the hereafter because they earned evil together in the world
Al-Anam,68,0.0772,0.034,0.928,0.038,then allah will also ask them assembly of jinni and men did there not come to ou messenger from among yourselves relating to you my sign and warning you of the encounter of this your day of judgement they will say yes we bear witness against ourselves they have been deluded by the life of this world and they will bear witness against themselves that they had disbelieved
Al-Anam,31,-0.4588,0.149,0.787,0.065,they will be made to bear this witness to show that it is not the way of your lord to destroy city unjustly while their people were unaware of the truth

Al-Anam,63,0.7506,0.093,0.743,0.164,and likewise the being supposed to have share in allah divinity have made the slaying of their offspring seem lawful to many of those who associate others with allah in his divinity so that they may ruin them and confound them regarding their faith if allah had so willed they would not have done that leave them alone to persist in their fabrication

Al-Araf,22,-0.7717,0.251,0.749,0.0,and those whose scale are light will be the loser for they are the one who have been unjust to our sign
Al-Araf,19,0.743,0.0,0.687,0.313,we assuredly established you in the earth and arranged for your livelihood in it little do you give thanks
Al-Araf,34,0.2732,0.0,0.94,0.06,we initiated your creation then we gave you each shape and then we said to the angel prostrate before adam they all prostrated except iblis he wa not one of those who fell prostrate
Al-Araf,30,0.5574,0.068,0.706,0.226,allah said what prevented you from prostrating when commanded you to do so he said am better than he you created me from fire and him you created from clay
Al-Araf,26,-0.6808,0.189,0.811,0.0,allah said then get you down from here it doe not behove you to be arrogant here so be gone you will be among the humiliated
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,satan replied give me respite till the day they shall be raised
Al-Araf,6,0.25,0.0,0.714,0.286,allah said you are granted respite
Al-Araf,19,0.5859,0.0,0.78,0.22,satan said since you have led me astray shall surely sit in ambush for them on your straight path
Al-Araf,29,0.6077,0.0,0.876,0.124,then will come upon them from the front and from the rear and from their right and from their left and you will not find most of them thankful
Al-Araf,19,-0.8625,0.375,0.625,0.0,allah said go away from here disgraced and expelled shall fill the hell with all those that follow you
Al-Araf,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,adam live you and your spouse in the garden and both of you eat from it wherever you will but never approach the tree or you shall become wrongdoer
Al-Araf,44,-0.8807,0.238,0.647,0.115,but satan made an evil suggestion to both of them that he might reveal to them their shame that had remained hidden from them he said your lord ha forbidden you to approach this tree only to prevent you from becoming angel or immortal
Al-Araf,11,0.6808,0.0,0.616,0.384,and he swore to them both surely am your sincere adviser
Al-Araf,57,-0.8096,0.148,0.802,0.05,thus satan brought about their fall by deceit and when they tasted of the tree their shame became vislible to them and both began to cover themselves with leaf from the garden then their lord called out to them did not forbid you from that tree and did not warn you that satan is your declared enemy
Al-Araf,29,-0.837,0.349,0.572,0.079,both cried out our lord we have wronged ourselves if you do not forgive u and do not have mercy on u we shall surely be among the loser
Al-Araf,23,-0.5267,0.137,0.82,0.043,allah said go down you are enemy one of the other for you there is dwelling and provision on the earth for while
Al-Araf,20,-0.5994,0.17,0.83,0.0,he continued you shall live there and there shall you die and from it you shall be raised to life
Al-Araf,44,-0.1027,0.045,0.919,0.036,child of adam indeed we have sent down to you garment which cover your shame and provides protection and adornment but the finest of all is the garment of piety that is one of the sign of allah so that they may take heed
Al-Araf,56,0.52,0.09,0.769,0.141,child of adam let not satan deceive you in the manner he deceived your parent out of paradise pulling off from them their clothing to reveal to them their shame he and his host surely see you from whence you do not see them we have made satan the guardian of those who do not believe
Al-Araf,41,0.7579,0.0,0.831,0.169,and when such people commit an indecent act they say we found our father doing that and allah ha enjoined it on u say surely allah never enjoins any indecency do you say thing regarding allah that you do not know
Al-Araf,42,0.802,0.0,0.823,0.177,say to them muhammad my lord enjoins justice and that you set your face aright at the time of every prayer and that you call upon him exclusively dedicating your faith to him you shall return to him a you were created
Al-Araf,37,0.7783,0.0,0.809,0.191,party he ha guided to the right way and for another party straying is justly it due for they have taken satan rather than allah a their guardian even though they think that they are rightly guided
Al-Araf,29,0.049,0.067,0.86,0.073,child of adam take your adornment at every time of prayer and eat and drink without going to excess for allah doe not like those who go to excess

Al-Araf,60,-0.1027,0.177,0.651,0.172,tell them muhammad my lord ha only forbidden indecent act whether overt or hidden all manner of sin wrongful transgression and he ha forbidden that you associate with allah in his divinity that for which he ha sent down no sanction and that you ascribe to allah thing of which you have no sure knowledge that they are from him
Al-Araf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for every community there is an appointed term and when it term arrives they cannot tarry behind moment nor can they get ahead
Al-Araf,35,0.5875,0.0,0.873,0.127,child of adam if messenger come to you from amongst yourselves who rehearse to you my sign then those who shun disobedience and mend their way shall have nothing to fear nor shall they grieve
Al-Araf,27,-0.8934,0.318,0.682,0.0,and those who reject our revelation a false and turn away from them in arrogance they shall be the inmate of hell and there shall they abide
Al-Araf,76,-0.624,0.079,0.881,0.04,who is more unjust then he who invents falsehood ascribing it to allah or who reject his revelation a false their full portion of god decree shall reach them until our deputed angel come to them to take charge of their soul and say where are the deity now those whom you invoked besides allah they will say they are all gone away from u and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbeliever

Al-Araf,25,0.6705,0.074,0.702,0.224,then the preceding one will say to the succeeding one you were in no way superior to u taste then this torment for your deed
Al-Araf,44,0.7351,0.151,0.61,0.239,surely the gate of heaven shall not be opened for those who reject our sign a false and turn away from them in arrogance nor shall they enter paradise until camel pass through the eye of needle thus do we reward the guilty one
Al-Araf,18,-0.6124,0.292,0.568,0.14,hell shall be their bed and also above them their covering thus do we reward the wrong doer
Al-Araf,30,0.7259,0.077,0.686,0.237,and those who believe and do good we do not impose upon any of them burden beyond his capacity they are the people of paradise and there they shall abide
Al-Araf,83,0.9517,0.032,0.748,0.219,we shall strip away all rancour from their heart and river shall flow beneath them and they shall say all praise be to allah who ha guided u on to this had it not been for allah who granted u guidance we would not be on the right path surely the messenger of our lord did indeed come down with truth then voice will cry out to them this is the paradise which you are made to inherit a reward for your deed
Al-Araf,53,0.4939,0.22,0.494,0.286,and the people of paradise shall cry to the people of hell surely we have found our lord promise to u to be true have you also found true what your lord ha promised you yes they shall answer and herald shall cry out among them allah curse be upon the wrong doer

Al-Araf,55,0.8519,0.069,0.752,0.179,and between the two there will be barrier and on the height will be men who will recognize each person by his mark and will cry out to the people of paradise peace be to you these will be the one who had not yet joined them in paradise though they long to do so
Al-Araf,31,-0.6808,0.137,0.863,0.0,and when the eye of the people of the height will be turned towards the people of hell they will say our lord do not cast u among the wrongdoing people
Al-Araf,33,-0.4847,0.184,0.737,0.079,and the people of the height will cry out to the men whom they would recognize by their mark saving neither your number nor the rich of which you were proud availed you
Al-Araf,36,0.3343,0.162,0.647,0.191,are these not the one of whom you swore that allah shall grant them nothing of his mercy to such it will be said enter paradise you have no cause to fear nor shall you grieve

Al-Araf,43,-0.1027,0.129,0.771,0.1,who have made their religion sport and play and whom the life of the world ha beguiled so on that day we shall forget them in the manner they forget their meeting of this day with u and persist in denying our revelation
Al-Araf,18,0.6597,0.0,0.748,0.252,surely we have brought them book which we expounded with knowledge guidance and mercy to those who believe
Al-Araf,77,-0.5267,0.15,0.738,0.113,are they waiting for the fulfilment of it warning on the day that warning is fulfilled those that have neglected it before will say the messenger of our lord did indeed bring forth the truth are there any intercessor who will now plead on our behalf or can we be restored to life that we might perform differently from that which we did they surely ended in utter loss and the lie they had fabricated failed them
Al-Araf,74,0.9468,0.0,0.785,0.215,surely your lord is none other than allah who created the heaven and the earth in six day and then ascended his throne who cause the night to cover the day and then the day swiftly pursues the night who created the sun and the moon and the star making them all subservient to his command lo his is the creation and his is the command blessed is allah the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,15,-0.12,0.175,0.675,0.151,call upon your lord with humility and in secret surely he doe not love transgressor
Al-Araf,32,0.8181,0.102,0.594,0.304,anddo not make mischief in the earth after it ha been set in order and call upon him with fear and longing surely allah mercy is close to those who do good
Al-Araf,58,-0.1779,0.124,0.748,0.128,and it is he who sends forth wind a glad tidings in advance of his mercy and when they have carried heavy laden cloud we drive it to dead land then we send down rain from it and bring forth therwith fruit of every kind in this manner do we raise the dead that you may take heed
Al-Araf,40,-0.1779,0.139,0.737,0.124,a for the good land vegetation come forth in abundance by the command of it lord whereas from the bad land only poor vegetation come forth thus do we expound our sign in diverse way for people who are grateful
Al-Araf,32,0.2023,0.136,0.707,0.157,indeed we sent forth noah to his people and he said my people serve allah you have no other god than him indeed fear for you the chastisement of an awesome day
Al-Araf,15,-0.4019,0.162,0.838,0.0,the leading men of his people replied we see that you are in palpable error

Al-Araf,36,-0.9136,0.315,0.607,0.078,but they charged him with falsehood thereupon we delivered noah and those who were with him in the ark and caused those who rejected our sign a false to be drowned surely they were blind folk
Al-Araf,28,0.649,0.065,0.712,0.223,and to ad we sent forth their brother hud he said my people serve allah you have no other god than him will you then not avoid evil
Al-Araf,22,-0.5106,0.136,0.864,0.0,the unbeliever among the leading men of his people said indeed we see you in folly and consider you to be liar
Al-Araf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,he said my people there is no folly in me rather am messenger from the lord of the universe

Al-Araf,55,0.3818,0.024,0.906,0.07,do you wonder that an exhortation should come to you from your lord through man from amongst yourselves that he may warn you and do call to mind when he made you successor after the people of noah and amply increased you in stature remember then the wondrous bounty of allah that you may prosper
Al-Araf,41,0.5267,0.068,0.766,0.167,they said have you come to u that we should worship none other than allah and forsake all whom our forefather were wont to worship then bring upon u the scourge with which you have threatened u if you are truthful
Al-Araf,49,-0.5994,0.174,0.735,0.091,hud warned them surely punishment and wrath from your lord have befallen upon you do you dispute with me about mere name that you and your forefather have concocted and for which allah ha sent down no sanction wait then and too am with you among those who wait
Al-Araf,31,0.0276,0.071,0.856,0.074,then we delivered hud and his companion by our mercy and we utterly cut off the last remnant of those who called the lie to our sign and would not believe
Al-Araf,66,-0.2453,0.185,0.653,0.162,and to thamud we sent forth their brother salih he said to them my people serve allah you have no other god than him truly there ha come to you clear proof from your lord this she camel from allah is divine portent for you so leave her alone to pasture on allah earth and touch her with no evil lest painful chastisement should seize you
Al-Araf,52,-0.3374,0.079,0.867,0.054,and call to mind when he made you successor after ad and gave you power in the earth so that you took for yourselves palace in it plain and hewed out dwelling in the mountain remember then the wondrous bounty of allah and do not go about creating mischief in the land
Al-Araf,42,0.296,0.065,0.823,0.112,the haughty elder of his people said to those believer who had been oppressed do you know that salih is one sent forth with message from his lord they replied surely we believe in the message with which he ha been sent
Al-Araf,13,0.0591,0.152,0.681,0.167,the haughty one remarked most certainly we disbelieve in that which you believe
Al-Araf,33,-0.0258,0.086,0.831,0.083,then they hamstrung the she camel disdainfuliy disobeyed the commandment of their lord and said salih bring upon u the scourge with which you threatened u if you are truly messenger of allah
Al-Araf,13,-0.7906,0.39,0.549,0.06,thereupon shocking catastrophe seized them so that they lay prostrate in their dwelling
Al-Araf,29,0.6542,0.078,0.695,0.227,and salih left them saying my people conveyed to you the message of my lord and gave you good advice but you have no liking for your well wishers
Al-Araf,36,-0.6124,0.132,0.868,0.0,and remember when we sent lot a messeng to his people and he said to them do you realize you practise an indecency of which no other people in the world were guilty of before you
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you approach men lustfully in place of woman you are people who exceed all bound
Al-Araf,17,-0.5106,0.223,0.777,0.0,their only answer wa banish them from your town they are people who pretend to be pure
Al-Araf,13,0.4939,0.0,0.789,0.211,then we delivered lot and his household save his wife who stayed behind
Al-Araf,17,-0.7717,0.309,0.691,0.0,and we let loose shower of stone upon them observe then the end of the evil doer
Al-Araf,71,0.9437,0.084,0.668,0.248,and to midian we sent forth their brother shu ayb he exhorted them my people serve allah you have no god but him indeed clear proof ha come to you from your lord so give just weight and measure and diminish not to men their thing and make no mischief on the earth after it ha been set in good order that is to your own good if you truly believe
Al-Araf,53,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and do not lie in ambush by every path of life seeking to overawe or to hinder from the path of allah those who believe nor seek to make the path crooked remember how you were once few and then he multiplied you and keep in mind what wa the end of mischiefmakers
Al-Araf,35,0.6369,0.0,0.887,0.113,and if there are some among you who believe in the message that bear while some do not believe have patience till allah shall judge between u he is the best of those who judge
Al-Araf,40,0.5994,0.116,0.671,0.213,the haughty elder of his people said shu ayb we shall certainly banish you and your companion in faith from our town or else you shall return to our faith shu ayb said what even though we abhor your faith
Al-Araf,69,0.9337,0.0,0.804,0.196,if we return to your faith after allah ha delivered u from it we would be fabricating lie against allah nor can we return to it again unless it be by the will of allah our lord our lord ha knowledge of all thing and in allah we put our trust our lord judge rightly between u and our people for you are the best of those who judge
Al-Araf,18,-0.5267,0.167,0.833,0.0,the elder of his people who disbelieved said should you follow shu ayb you will be utter loser
Al-Araf,12,-0.7906,0.413,0.523,0.064,thereupon shocking catastrophe seized them and they remained prostrate in their dwelling
Al-Araf,23,-0.8225,0.312,0.688,0.0,those who had charged shu ayb with lying became a though they had never lived there it is they who became utter loser
Al-Araf,37,0.6705,0.108,0.667,0.226,shu ayb then departed from his people and said my people surely conveyed to you the message of my lord and gave you sincere advice how then can mourn for people who refuse to accept the truth
Al-Araf,20,-0.6249,0.221,0.779,0.0,never have we sent prophet to place without trying it people with adversity and hardship that they may humble themselves
Al-Araf,30,-0.4767,0.16,0.769,0.071,then we changed adversity into ease until they throve and said our forefather had also seen both adversity and prosperity so we suddenly seized them without their even perceiving it
Al-Araf,43,0.4854,0.049,0.794,0.157,had the people of those town believed and been god fearing we would certainly have opened up to them blessing from the heaven and the earth but they gave the lie to their prophet and so we seized them for their deed so
Al-Araf,22,-0.2023,0.125,0.781,0.094,do the people of those town feel secure that our punishment will not come to them at night while they are asleep
Al-Araf,24,0.1531,0.11,0.724,0.166,or do the people of those town feel secure that our punishment will not come to them by daylight while they are at play
Al-Araf,22,0.1027,0.125,0.699,0.176,do they feel secure against the design of allah none can feel secure against the design of allah except the utter loser
Al-Araf,51,-0.5719,0.108,0.85,0.042,ha it not then become plain to those who have inherited the earth in the wake of the former generation that had we so willed we could have afflicted them for their sin they however are heedless to basic fact and so we seal their heart so that they hear nothing
Al-Araf,46,-0.5859,0.142,0.769,0.089,to those earlier community some of whose story we relate to you there had indeed come messenger with clear proof but they would not believe what they had once rejected a false thus it is that allah seal the heart of those who deny the truth
Al-Araf,20,0.4703,0.0,0.861,0.139,we did not find most of them true to their covenant indeed we found most of them to he transgressor
Al-Araf,29,-0.3071,0.101,0.837,0.062,after those we sent forth moses with our sign to pharaoh and his noble but they dealt with our sign unjustly observe then what happened to the mischief maker
Al-Araf,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and moses said pharaoh am messenger from the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,36,0.6597,0.0,0.863,0.137,and it behoves me to say nothing about allah except what is true have come to you with clear sign of having been sent from your lord so let the child of israel go with me
Al-Araf,15,0.4588,0.0,0.824,0.176,pharaoh said if you have brought sign then bring it forth if you are truthful
Al-Araf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereupon moses threw his rod and suddenly it wa veritable serpent
Al-Araf,13,0.4939,0.0,0.789,0.211,then he drew out his hand and it appeared luminous to all beholder
Al-Araf,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,the elder of pharaoh people said surely this man is skilful magician
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who seek to drive you out from your land what would you have u do
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they advised pharaoh put off moses and his brother for while and send forth herald to your city
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,to summon every skilful magician to your presence
Al-Araf,15,0.8176,0.0,0.634,0.366,and the magician came to pharaoh and said shall we have reward if we win
Al-Araf,14,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,pharaoh replied certainly and you shall be among those who are near to me
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they said moses will you first throw your rod or shall we throw
Al-Araf,26,0.1531,0.07,0.839,0.091,moses said you throw so when they threw their rod they enchanted the eye of the people and struck them with awe and produced mighty sorcery
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we directed moses now you throw your rod and lo it swallowed up all their false device
Al-Araf,11,-0.128,0.199,0.638,0.163,thus wa the truth established and their doings proved in vain
Al-Araf,10,-0.7351,0.437,0.563,0.0,pharaoh and his men were defeated and put to shame
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and the magician flung themselves prostrate
Al-Araf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,saying we believe in the lord of the universe
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,30,0.4404,0.0,0.909,0.091,pharaoh said what do you believe before you have my permission surely this is plot you have contrived to drive out the ruler from the capital so you shall see
Al-Araf,16,0.2732,0.109,0.725,0.166,shall cut off your hand and foot on the opposite side and then crucify you all
Al-Araf,9,0.4404,0.0,0.734,0.266,they replied we shall surely return to our lord
Al-Araf,37,-0.8074,0.196,0.804,0.0,will you punish u just because we believed in the sign of our lord when they came to u our lord shower u with perseverance and cause u to die a those who have submitted to you
Al-Araf,47,-0.7096,0.186,0.733,0.081,the elder of pharaoh people said will you leave alone moses and his people to spread mischief in the land and forsake you and your god pharaoh replied we will kill their male child and spare their female one for indeed we hold irresistible sway over them
Al-Araf,35,0.2732,0.089,0.747,0.164,moses said to his people seek help from allah and be steadfast the earth is allah he bestows it on those of his servant he chooses the end of thing belongs to the god fearing
Al-Araf,39,-0.8779,0.224,0.776,0.0,the people of moses replied we were oppressed before your coming to u and after it moses said your lord will soon destroy your enemy and make you ruler in the land then he will see how you act
Al-Araf,17,-0.7184,0.333,0.667,0.0,we afflicted the people of pharaoh with hard time and with poor harvest that they may heed
Al-Araf,46,0.2263,0.058,0.866,0.076,but whenever prosperity came their way they said this is our due and whatever hardship befell them they attributed it to the misfortune of moses and those who followed him surely their misfortune had been decreed by allah but most of them do not know that
Al-Araf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and they said to moses whatever sign you might produce before u in order to enchant u we are not going to believe you
Al-Araf,32,-0.5267,0.209,0.69,0.101,then we afflicted them with great flood and locust and the louse and the frog and the blood all these were distinct sign and yet they remained haughty they were wicked people
Al-Araf,49,0.8934,0.035,0.723,0.242,each time scourge struck them they said moses pray for u to your lord on the strength of the prophethood he ha bestowed upon you surely if you remove this scourge from u we will truly believe in you and will let the child of israel go with you
Al-Araf,23,-0.1531,0.133,0.719,0.147,but when we removed the scourge from them until term term which they were bound to reach they at once broke their promise
Al-Araf,28,-0.5719,0.121,0.879,0.0,so we inflicted our retribution on them and caused them to drown in the sea because they gave the lie to our sign and were heedless of them
Al-Araf,53,0.7964,0.084,0.722,0.194,and we made those who had been persecuted inherit the eastern and western land which we had blessed thus your lord gracious promise wa fulfilled to the child of israel for they had endured with patience and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people had wrought and all that they had built
Al-Araf,45,0.7184,0.043,0.772,0.185,and we led the child of israel across the sea and then they came upon people who were devoted to the worship of their idol they said moses make for u god even a they have god moses said you are indeed an ignorant people
Al-Araf,17,-0.7579,0.302,0.698,0.0,the way these people follow is bound to lead to destruction and all their work are vain
Al-Araf,21,0.5423,0.0,0.809,0.191,moses said should seek any god for you other than allah although it is he who ha exalted you above all
Al-Araf,39,0.0,0.143,0.714,0.143,and call to mind when we delivered you from pharaoh people who perpetrated on you terrible torment putting your male to death and sparing your female surely in it there wa an awesome trial for you from your lord
Al-Araf,50,0.34,0.046,0.864,0.09,and we appointed for moses thirty night to which we added ten whereby the term of forty night set by his lord wa fulfilled and moses said to aaron his brother take my place among my people act righteously and do not follow the path of those who create mischief
Al-Araf,100,0.7184,0.027,0.89,0.083,and when moses came at our appointment and his lord spoke to him he said my lord reveal yourself to me that may look upon you he replied never can you see me however behold this mount if it remains firm in it place only then you will be able to see me and a soon a his lord unveiled his glory to the mount he crushed it into fine dust and moses fell down in swoon and when he recovered he said glory be to you to you turn in repentance and am the foremost among those who believe
Al-Araf,38,0.8834,0.0,0.728,0.272,he said moses have indeed preferred you to all others by virtue of the message have entrusted to you and by virtue of my speaking to you hold fast therefore to whatever have granted you and give thanks
Al-Araf,50,0.6124,0.059,0.813,0.128,and we ordained for moses in the tablet all manner of admonition and instruction concerning all thing and said to him hold to these with all your strength and bid your people to follow them in accord with their best understanding shall soon show you the habitation of the wicked
Al-Araf,73,-0.8402,0.103,0.897,0.0,shall turn away from my sign those who without any right behaved haughtily in the earth even if they may witness each and every sign they shall not believe therein and even if they see the right path they shall still not follow it but if they see the path of error they shall choose it for their path this is because they rejected our sign a false and were heedless to them
Al-Araf,28,-0.6705,0.18,0.82,0.0,vain are the deed of those who reject our sign a false and to the meeting of the hereafter shall they be recompensed except according to their deed
Al-Araf,46,-0.4019,0.098,0.858,0.044,and in the absence of moses his people made the image of calf from their ornament which lowed did they not observe that it could neither speak nor give them any guidance and still they made it an object of worship they were indeed wrong doing
Al-Araf,37,-0.9357,0.382,0.618,0.0,and when they were afflicted with remorse and realized that they had fallen into error they said if our lord doe not have mercy on u and doe not pardon u we shall be among the loser
Al-Araf,86,-0.9213,0.162,0.809,0.029,and when moses returned to his people full of wrath and sorrow he said vile is the course you have followed in my absence could you not patiently wait for the decree of your lord and he threw down the tablet of the law and took hold of his brother head dragging him to himself aaron said my mother son the people overpowered me and almost killed me so let not my enemy gloat over me and do not number me among the wrong doing folk
Al-Araf,25,0.7845,0.0,0.692,0.308,thereupon moses said lord grant forgiveness upon me and my brother and admit u to your mercy for you are most merciful of the merciful
Al-Araf,36,0.7506,0.075,0.708,0.217,in reply they were told verily those who worshipped the calf will certainly incur indignation from their lord and will be abased in the life of this world thus do we reward those who fabricate lie
Al-Araf,26,0.5423,0.128,0.612,0.259,a for those who do evil and later repent and have faith such shall find their lord all forgiving all compassionate after they repent and believe
Al-Araf,28,-0.6597,0.201,0.727,0.073,and when the anger of moses wa stilled he took up the tablet again the text of which comprised guidance and mercy to those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,87,0.6956,0.126,0.73,0.144,and out of his people moses singled out seventy men for our appointment then when violent shaking seized them he addressed his lord had you willed my lord you could have destroyed them and me long ago will you destroy u for what the fool amongst u did that wa nothing but trial from you whereby you mislead whom you will and guide whom you will you alone are our guardian forgive u then and have mercy upon u you are the best of those who forgive
Al-Araf,54,0.765,0.09,0.701,0.209,and ordain for u what is good in this world and in the world to come for to you have we turned he replied afflict whomsoever wish with my chastisement a for my mercy it encompasses everything will show mercy to those who abstain from evil pay zakat and have faith in our sign
Al-Araf,92,0.0708,0.091,0.806,0.103,to day this mercy is for those who follow the ummi prophet whom they find mentioned in the torah and the gospel with them he enjoins upon them what is good and forbids them what is evil he make the clean thing lawful to them and prohibits all corrupt thing and remove from them their burden and the shackle that were upon them so those who believe in him and assist him and succour him and follow the light which ha been sent down with him it is they who shall prosper
Al-Araf,63,0.4019,0.093,0.764,0.143,say muhammad men am allah messenger to you all of him to whom belongs the dominion of the heaven and the earth there is no god but he he grant life and deal death have faith then in allah and in his messenger the ummi prophet who belief in allah and his word and follow him so that you may be guided aright
Al-Araf,23,0.8126,0.0,0.704,0.296,among the people of moses there wa party who guided others in the way of the truth and established justice in it light
Al-Araf,82,-0.6059,0.068,0.911,0.022,and we divided them into twelve tribe forming them into community when his people asked moses for water we directed him smite the rock with your rod then twelve spring gushed forth from the rock and every people knew their drinking place and we caused thick cloud to provide them shade and we sent down upon them manna and quail saying eat of the clean thing that we have provided you they wronged not u but it wa themselves that they wronged
Al-Araf,43,0.7269,0.069,0.707,0.224,and recall when it wa said to them dwell in this town and eat plentifully of whatever you please and say repentance and enter the gate prostrate we shall forgive you your sin and shall bestow further favour on those who do good
Al-Araf,31,-0.7269,0.243,0.672,0.085,then the wrong doer among them substituted another word in place of the one told them so we sent upon them scourge from the heaven a punishment for their wrong doing
Al-Araf,51,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and ask the people of moses concerning the town situated along the sea how it people profaned the sabbath when fish came to them breaking the water surface on sabbath day and would not come to them on other than sabbath day thus did we try them because of their disobedience
Al-Araf,48,-0.6124,0.168,0.714,0.117,and recall when party of them said why do you admonish people whom allah is about to destroy or punish severely they said we admonish them in order to be able to offer an excuse before your lord and in the hope that they will guard against disobedience
Al-Araf,27,-0.9524,0.437,0.563,0.0,then when they forgot what they had been exhorted we delivered those who forbade evil and afflicted the wrong doer with grievous chastisement because of their evildoing
Al-Araf,16,-0.6705,0.282,0.718,0.0,and when they persisted in pursuing that which had been forbidden we said become despised ape
Al-Araf,41,0.6369,0.057,0.756,0.187,and recall when your lord proclaimed that he would continually set in authority over them till the day of judgement those who would ruthless oppress thern surely your lord is swift in chastising and yet he is all forgiving all merciful
Al-Araf,30,-0.4215,0.088,0.912,0.0,and we dispersed them through the earth in community some were righteous others were not and we tested them with prosperity and adversity that they may turn back to righteousness
Al-Araf,92,0.872,0.047,0.776,0.177,then others succeeded them who inherited the scripture and yet kept themselves occupied in acquiring the good of this world and kept saying we shall be forgiven and when there come to them an opportunity for acquiring more of those good they seize it wa not the covenant of the book taken from them that they would not ascribe to allah anything but the truth and they have read what is in the book and know that the abode of the hereafter is better for the god fearing do you not understand
Al-Araf,24,-0.7553,0.262,0.738,0.0,those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer we shall not allow the reward of such righteous men to go to waste
Al-Araf,49,-0.7003,0.112,0.888,0.0,and recall when we shook the mountain over them a though it were canopy and they thought that it wa going to fall over them and we said hold firmly to that which we have given you and remember what is in it that you may guard against evil
Al-Araf,52,0.2263,0.033,0.917,0.05,and recall prophet when your lord brought forth descendant from the loin of the son of adam and made them witness against their ownselves asking them am not your lord they said yes we do testify we did so lest you claim on the day of resurrection we were unaware of this
Al-Araf,33,0.0516,0.097,0.801,0.102,or say our forefather before u who associated others with allah in his divinity we were merely their offspring who followed them and would you destroy u for that which the unrighteous did
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thus do we expound the sign that they may turn back to the right path
Al-Araf,34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and recite to them muhammad the story of the man to whom we gave our sign and who turned away from them then ultimately satan caught up with him and he wa led astray
Al-Araf,67,-0.7876,0.151,0.802,0.047,now had we so willed we could indeed have exalted him through those sign but he clung to earthly life and followed his carnal desire thus his parable is that of the dog who lolls out his tongue whether you attack him or leave him alone such is the parable of those who reject our sign a false narrate to them these parable that they may reflect
Al-Araf,20,-0.8807,0.389,0.611,0.0,evil is the example of the people who reject our sign a false and perpetrate wrong against their own self
Al-Araf,23,-0.6597,0.205,0.795,0.0,he whom allah guide he alone is rightly guided and he whom allah let go astray it is they who are the loser
Al-Araf,54,-0.8807,0.219,0.681,0.1,and certainly we have created for hell many of the jinni and mankind they have heart with which they fail to understand and they have eye with which they fail to see and they have ear with which they fail to hear they are like cattle indeed even more astray such are utterly heedless
Al-Araf,27,0.624,0.07,0.734,0.196,allah ha the most excellent name so call on him by his name and shun those who distort them they shall soon be requited for their deed
Al-Araf,22,0.7184,0.0,0.731,0.269,and of those whom we have created there is party who guide men through the truth and act justly according to it
Al-Araf,24,-0.7579,0.245,0.755,0.0,a for those who reject our sign a false we shall lead them step by step to their ruin without their even perceiving it
Al-Araf,11,0.3612,0.0,0.8,0.2,and for this purpose will grant them respite my design is
Al-Araf,20,0.6259,0.0,0.779,0.221,have they not pondered that their companion the prophet muhammad is not afflicted with insanity he is only plain warner
Al-Araf,43,0.6059,0.056,0.789,0.156,have they not observed the kingdom of the heaven and the earth and all that allah ha created and that their term of life might have drawn near after this warning from the prophet what will it be that will make them believe
Al-Araf,22,-0.34,0.145,0.855,0.0,for those whom allah let go astray there is no guide and he will leave them in their transgression to stumble blindly
Al-Araf,85,0.7785,0.044,0.85,0.106,they ask you concerning the hour when will it coming be say the knowledge of it is with my lord alone none but he will disclose it at it time that will weigh heavily on the heaven and the earth and it shall not come to you other than all of sudden they ask you a if you are eagerly inquisitive about it concerning it say to them the knowledge of it is with none except allah but most people are unaware of this reality
Al-Araf,51,0.1045,0.184,0.612,0.205,tell them muhammad have no power to benefit or harm myself except a allah may please and had knowledge of the unseen should have amassed all kind of good and no evil would have ever touched me am merely warner and the herald of glad tidings to those who have faith
Al-Araf,61,0.886,0.041,0.744,0.215,it is he allah who created you from single being and out of it he made it mate that he may find comfort in her and when he cover her she bear light burden and go about with it then when she grows heavy they pray to their lord if you bestow upon u healthy child we will surely give thanks
Al-Araf,30,0.5499,0.0,0.891,0.109,but when he vouchsafes them healthy child they attribute to him partner regarding what allah had bestowed upon them subliminally exalted is allah above that which they associate with him
Al-Araf,18,0.7783,0.0,0.658,0.342,do they associate with allah in his divinity those who can create nothing rather they are themselves created
Al-Araf,12,0.4939,0.133,0.542,0.325,they have no power to help others nor can they help themselves

Al-Araf,19,-0.6256,0.242,0.758,0.0,a for their brother the satan they draw them deeper into error and do not relax in their effort
Al-Araf,55,0.875,0.0,0.823,0.177,prophet when you do not produce before them any miracle they say why do you not choose for yourself miracle say to them follow only what is revealed to me by my lord this is nothing but mean of insight into the truth and guidance and mercy from your lord to the people who believe
Al-Araf,21,0.4588,0.0,0.826,0.174,so when the qur an is recited listen carefully to it and keep silent so that you may be shown mercy

Al-Araf,26,0.0772,0.109,0.772,0.119,the angel who are near to your lord never turn away from his service out of arrogance they rather glorify him and prostrate themselves before him
Al-Anfal,40,-0.8783,0.235,0.71,0.055,they ask you concerning the spoil of war tell them the spoil of war belong to allah and the messenger so fear allah and set thing right between you and obey allah and his messenger if you are true believer
Al-Anfal,33,0.836,0.0,0.771,0.229,the true believer are those who when allah name is mentioned their heart quake and when his verse are recited to them their faith grows and who put their trust in their lord
Al-Anfal,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided them
Al-Anfal,22,0.5267,0.122,0.608,0.27,such people are indeed true believer they have high rank with their lord and forgiveness for their sin and an honourable sustenance
Al-Anfal,33,0.4019,0.0,0.92,0.08,now with regard to the spoil the same situation exists a when your lord brought you forth from your home in righteous cause while party among the believer were much averse to it
Al-Anfal,25,-0.6124,0.213,0.709,0.078,they disputed with you about the truth after that had become evident a if they were being driven to death with their eye wide open
Al-Anfal,51,0.8591,0.0,0.817,0.183,and recall when allah promised you that one of the two host would fall to you and you wished that the one without arm should fall into your hand but allah sought to prove by his word the truth to be true and to annihilate the unbeliever to the last remnant
Al-Anfal,24,-0.0772,0.144,0.689,0.167,that he might prove the truth to be true and the false to be false however averse the evil doer might be to it
Al-Anfal,25,0.4019,0.0,0.899,0.101,and recall when you implored your lord for help and he responded to you will indeed reinforce you with thousand angel coming host after host
Al-Anfal,29,0.8807,0.054,0.618,0.328,allah meant this a glad tidings and that your heart may be set at rest for every help come from allah alone surely allah is all mighty all wise
Al-Anfal,53,0.8779,0.0,0.799,0.201,and recall when allah brought on you drowsiness giving you feeling of peace and security from him and he sent down rain upon you from the sky that he might cleanse you through it and take away from you the pollution of satan and strengthen your heart and steady your foot through it
Al-Anfal,43,-0.4557,0.184,0.709,0.107,and recall when your lord inspired the angel am certainly with you so make firm the foot of those who believe will cast terror into the heart of those who disbelieve so strike at their neck and strike at every pore and tip
Al-Anfal,23,-0.7003,0.216,0.784,0.0,this is because they defied allah and his messenger whoever defies allah and his messenger must know that allah is severe in punishment
Al-Anfal,22,-0.9001,0.4,0.6,0.0,that is your punishment from allah so taste this punishment and know that for the unbeliever is the punishment of the fire
Al-Anfal,17,-0.3818,0.14,0.86,0.0,believer whenever you encounter hostile force of unbeliever do not turn your back to them in flight
Al-Anfal,43,-0.8316,0.176,0.781,0.043,for he who turn his back on them on such ar occasion except that it be for tactical reason or turning to join another company he shall incur the wrath of allah and hell shall be his abode it is an evil destination
Al-Anfal,60,-0.4497,0.091,0.846,0.063,so the fact is that it wa not you but it wa allah who killed them and it wa not you when you threw sand at them but it wa allah who threw it and the believer were employed for the task that he might cause the believer to successfully pas through this test allah is all hearing all knowing
Al-Anfal,18,0.1779,0.109,0.746,0.144,this is his manner of dealing with you a for the unbeliever allah will surely undermine their design
Al-Anfal,60,-0.4118,0.114,0.769,0.117,tell the unbeliever if you have sought judgement then surely judgement ha come to you and if you desist from disobedience it is all the better for you but if you revert to your mischief we will again chastise you and your host howsoever numerous will never be of any avail to you know well allah is with the believer
Al-Anfal,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,believer obey allah and his messenger and do not turn away from him after you hear his command
Al-Anfal,15,-0.2755,0.131,0.869,0.0,and do not be like those who say we hear though they do not hearken
Al-Anfal,24,-0.8126,0.252,0.748,0.0,indeed the worst kind of all beast in the sight of allah are the people that are deaf and dumb and do not understand
Al-Anfal,34,0.4404,0.095,0.714,0.191,and had allah known in them any good he would surely have made them hear but being a they are even if he made them hear they would have surely turned away in aversion
Al-Anfal,41,0.2732,0.0,0.95,0.05,believer respond to allah and respond to the messenger when he call you to that which give you life know well that allah stand between man and his heart and it is to him that all of you shall be mustered
Al-Anfal,25,-0.2129,0.237,0.55,0.213,and guard against the mischief that will not only bring punishment to the wrong doer among you know well that allah is severe in punishment
Al-Anfal,43,0.6808,0.111,0.657,0.232,and recall when you were few in number and deemed weak in the land fearful lest people do away with you then he provided you refuge strengthened you with his help and provided you sustenance with good thing that you may be grateful
Al-Anfal,17,0.5106,0.0,0.829,0.171,believer do not be unfaithful to allah and the messenger nor be knowingly unfaithful to your trust
Al-Anfal,19,0.765,0.0,0.72,0.28,know well that your belonging and your child are but trial and that with allah there is mighty reward
Al-Anfal,26,-0.4939,0.204,0.659,0.138,believer if you fear allah he will grant you criterion and will cleanse you of your sin and forgive you allah is lord of abounding bounty
Al-Anfal,35,-0.128,0.112,0.788,0.1,and recall how those who disbelieved schemed against you to take you captive or kill you or drive you away they schemed and allah did also scheme allah is the best of those who scheme
Al-Anfal,32,0.1901,0.0,0.947,0.053,and when our verse are recited to them they say we have heard we could if we willed compose the like of it they are nothing but fable of the ancient time
Al-Anfal,29,0.4019,0.089,0.738,0.172,and also recall when they said allah if this indeed be the truth from you then rain down stone upon u from heaven or bring upon u painful chastisement
Al-Anfal,25,0.8807,0.0,0.683,0.317,but allah wa not to chastise them while you are in their midst nor wa allah going to chastise them while they sought his forgiveness
Al-Anfal,44,-0.9466,0.299,0.675,0.026,but what prevents allah from chastising them now when they are hindering people from the holy mosque even though they are not even it true guardian for it true guardian are none but the god fearing though most of them do not know that
Al-Anfal,20,-0.0387,0.129,0.748,0.123,their prayer at the house is nothing but whistling and handclapping taste then this chastisement for your denying the truth
Al-Anfal,51,-0.3182,0.186,0.633,0.181,surely those who deny the truth spend their wealth to hinder people from the way of allah and will continue to so spend until their effort become source of intense regret for them and then they will be vanquished and then these denier of the truth will be driven to hell
Al-Anfal,36,-0.8979,0.299,0.599,0.102,so that allah may separate the bad from the good and join together all those who are bad into pile one upon another and cast them into hell they it is they who are the loser
Al-Anfal,36,-0.1779,0.105,0.784,0.112,prophet tell the unbeliever that if they desist from evil their past shall be forgiven and if they revert to their past way then it is well known what happened with the people of the past
Al-Anfal,31,-0.5719,0.203,0.72,0.077,and fight against them until the mischief end and the way prescribed by allah the whole of it prevail then if they give up mischief surely allah see what they do
Al-Anfal,20,0.9505,0.0,0.502,0.498,but if they turn away then know well that allah is your protector an excellent protector and an excellent helper
Al-Anfal,76,0.4767,0.059,0.844,0.096,know that one fifth of the spoil that you obtain belongs to allah to the messenger to the near of kin to the orphan and the needy and the wayfarer this you must observe if you truly believe in allah and in what we sent down on our servant on the day when the true wa distinguished from the false the day on which the two army met in battle allah ha power over all thing
Al-Anfal,86,0.9366,0.0,0.851,0.149,and recall when you were encamped at the nearer end of the valley of badr and they were at the farther end and the caravan below you along the seaside had you made mutual appointment to meet in encounter you would have declined but encounter wa brought about so that allah might accomplish what he had decreed and that he who wa to perish should perish through clear proof and who wa to survive might survive through clear proof surely allah is all hearing all knowing
Al-Anfal,51,0.7783,0.058,0.768,0.174,and recall when allah showed them to you in your dream to be few in number and had he showed them to you to be numerous you would have flagged and disagreed with one another about fighting them but allah saved you surely allah know what is hidden in the breast
Al-Anfal,44,0.0772,0.057,0.857,0.086,and recall when he made them appear a few in your eye when you met them in the battle just a he lessened you in their eye so that allah might accomplish what had been decreed to allah are all matter referred for decision
Al-Anfal,17,0.128,0.126,0.725,0.15,believer when you encounter host in battle stand firm and remember allah much that you may triumph
Al-Anfal,32,0.7506,0.068,0.678,0.254,and obey allah and his messenger and do not quarrel with one another lest you should lose courage and your power depart be steadfast surely allah is with those who remain steadfast

Al-Anfal,58,0.636,0.063,0.782,0.155,and recall when satan made their work seem fair to them and said none shall overcome you today and am your supporter but when the two army faced each other he turned on his heel and said surely am quit of you for behold that which you do not indeed fear allah and allah is stern in punishment
Al-Anfal,33,0.9042,0.0,0.704,0.296,and recall when the hypocrite and those whose heart were diseased said their faith ha deluded these believer but he who put his trust in allah shall find allah all mighty all wise
Al-Anfal,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and if you could only see when the angel took away the soul of the unbeliever striking them on their face and back saying taste the torment of burning
Al-Anfal,19,0.4023,0.127,0.637,0.235,this is your punishment for what your hand wrought allah is not unjust in the least to his creature
Al-Anfal,36,0.1779,0.142,0.678,0.179,their case is like that of the people of pharaoh and those before them they denied the sign of allah and so allah seized them for their sin surely allah is all powerful stern in retribution
Al-Anfal,30,0.802,0.0,0.767,0.233,this happened because allah is not one to change the favour which he ha bestowed upon people until they have changed their attitude surely allah is all hearing all knowing
Al-Anfal,45,-0.9401,0.298,0.659,0.043,their case is like that of the people of pharaoh and those before them they rejected the sign of their lord a false and so we destroyed them for their sin and caused the people of pharaoh to drown for they were wrong doer all
Al-Anfal,27,-0.128,0.237,0.514,0.249,surely the worst moving creature in the sight of allah are those who definitively denied the truth and are therefore in no way prepared to accept it
Al-Anfal,23,-0.0444,0.106,0.795,0.099,especially those with whom you entered into covenant and then they broke their covenant time after time and who do not fear allah
Al-Anfal,22,-0.8591,0.333,0.667,0.0,so if you meet them in war make of them fearsome example for those who follow them that they may he admonished

At-Tawbah,50,0.5352,0.0,0.915,0.085,do you consider providing water to the pilgrim and tending the sacred mosque equal in worth to believing in allah and the last day and striving in the cause of allah the two are not equal with allah allah doe not direct the wrong doing folk to the right way
At-Tawbah,29,0.5267,0.0,0.892,0.108,the higher rank with allah is for those who believed and migrated and strove in his cause with their belonging and their person it is they who are triumphant

Hud,21,-0.19,0.215,0.595,0.189,if we ever favour man with our mercy and then take it away from him he becomes utterly desperate totally ungrateful
Hud,26,0.4588,0.172,0.574,0.254,and if we let him taste favour after harm ha touched him he say all my ill are gone and he suddenly becomes exultant and boastful
Hud,16,0.872,0.0,0.568,0.432,except those who are patient and act righteously such shall have allah forgiveness and great reward
Hud,51,0.5764,0.039,0.837,0.123,messenger let it not happen that you omit to expound portion of what wa revealed to you and do not be distressed that they will say why wa treasure not bestowed upon him or why did no angel accompany him for you are merely warner whereas allah ha control over everything
Hud,44,0.8625,0.0,0.791,0.209,do they say he ha invented this book himself say if that is so bring ten surahs the like of it of your composition and call upon all the deity you can other than allah to your help do so if you are truthful
Hud,41,0.7838,0.034,0.743,0.223,then if your deity do not respond to your call for help then feel assured that this book wa revealed with the knowledge of allah and that there is no true god but him will you then surrender to this truth
Hud,35,-0.5267,0.143,0.8,0.057,those who seek merely the present world and it adornment we fully recompense them for their work in this world and they are made to suffer no diminution in it concerning what is their due
Hud,38,-0.6697,0.132,0.868,0.0,they are the one who shall have nothing in the hereafter except fire there they shall come to know that their deed in the world have come to naught and that whatever they have done is absolutely useless
Hud,99,0.7605,0.103,0.738,0.159,can it happen that he who take his stand on clear evidence from his lord subsequently followed by witness from him in his support and prior to that the book of moses wa revealed a guide and mercy would even he deny the truth in the manner of those who adore the life of this world rather such men are bound to believe in it the fire shall be the promised resort of the group that disbelieve so be in no doubt about it for this indeed is the truth from your lord although most people do not believe
Hud,43,-0.8689,0.233,0.72,0.047,and who is greater wrong doer than he who invents lie against allah such men will be set forth before their lord and witness will say these are the one who lied against their lord lo allah curse be upon the wrong doer
Hud,20,-0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,upon those who bar people from the way of allah and seek in it crookedness and disbelieve in the hereafter
Hud,33,-0.6369,0.144,0.856,0.0,they had no power to frustrate allah design in the earth nor did they have any protector against allah their chastisement will be doubled they were unable to hear nor could they see
Hud,14,-0.6808,0.318,0.682,0.0,they caused utter loss to themselves and all that they had invented failed them
Hud,10,0.4588,0.202,0.417,0.381,doubtlessly they shall be the greatest loser in the hereafter
Hud,27,0.802,0.0,0.769,0.231,a for those who believed and acted righteously and dedicated themselves totally to their lord they are the people of paradise and there they shall abide forever

Hud,66,-0.4404,0.113,0.814,0.073,the notable among noah own people who had refused to follow him responded we merely consider you human being like ourselves nor do we find among those who follow you except the lowliest of our folk the men who follow you without any proper reason we see nothing in you to suggest that you are any better than u rather we believe you to be liar
Hud,39,0.8274,0.056,0.707,0.237,noah said my people if base myself on clear evidence from my lord and have also been blessed by his mercy to which you have been blind how can we force it upon you despite your aversion to it
Hud,35,-0.5023,0.114,0.886,0.0,my people seek no recompense from you my recompense is only with allah nor will drive away those who believe they are destined to meet their lord but find you to be an ignorant people
Hud,26,0.6597,0.0,0.816,0.184,my people were to drive the men of faith away who will protect me from the chastisement of allah do you not understand even this much
Hud,67,0.2249,0.074,0.841,0.085,do not say to you that posse allah treasure nor that have access to the realm beyond the ken of sense perception nor do claim to be an angel nor do say regarding those whom you look upon with disdain that allah will not bestow any good upon them allah know best what is in their heart were to say so would be one of the wrongdoer
Hud,31,-0.2023,0.21,0.628,0.161,they said noah surely you have disputed with u and have prolonged your dispute now bring upon u the chastisement that you threaten u with do so if you are truthful
Hud,22,-0.5046,0.135,0.865,0.0,noah said only allah will bring it upon you if he so will and you will be utterly unable to frustrate that
Hud,33,0.4929,0.063,0.763,0.174,if want to give you good advice that will not profit you if allah himself ha decided to let you go astray he is your lord and to him will you be returned
Hud,35,-0.7645,0.209,0.716,0.075,muhammad do they say that he himself ha forged this message tell them if have forged this the guilt of it will fall upon me but am not responsible for the crime you are committing
Hud,29,0.0638,0.07,0.853,0.077,it wa revealed to noah that no more of your people other than those who already believe will ever come to believe so do not grieve over their deed
Hud,29,-0.8591,0.288,0.643,0.069,and build the ark under our eye and our direction and do not supplicate me concerning those who have engaged in wrong doing they are doomed to be drowned
Hud,36,0.3612,0.0,0.93,0.07,a noah wa building the ark whenever the leading men of his nation passed by him they would scoff at him he said if you scoff at u we too scoff at you in like manner
Hud,21,-0.4939,0.181,0.819,0.0,you will come to know who will be struck by humiliating chastisement and who will be subjected to an unceasing torment
Hud,56,-0.25,0.036,0.964,0.0,thus it wa until our command came to pas and the oven boiled over we said take into the ark pair of every specie and take your own family except those who have already been declared a unworthy and also take everyone who belief but those who along with him had believed were indeed just few
Hud,23,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,noah said embark in it in the name of allah is it sailing and it anchorage my lord is ever forgiving most merciful
Hud,32,0.3612,0.0,0.923,0.077,the ark sailed along with them amid mountain like wave noah spotting his son at distance called out to him my son embark with u and do not be with the unbeliever
Hud,48,0.6124,0.069,0.775,0.157,the son replied will go to mountain for refuge and it will save me from the water noah said none can save anyone today from the command of allah except those on whom he may have mercy thereupon wave swept in between the two and he wa drowned
Hud,38,0.4588,0.07,0.792,0.138,and the command wa given earth swallow up your water and heaven abate so the water subsided the command wa fulfilled and the ark settled on mount judi and it wa said away with the wrong doing folk
Hud,30,0.9042,0.0,0.681,0.319,and noah called out to his lord saying my lord my son is of my family surely your promise is true and you are the greatest of those who judge
Hud,42,-0.4053,0.136,0.807,0.057,in response noah wa told most certainly he is not of your family verily he is of unrighteous conduct so do not ask of me for that concerning which you have no knowledge admonish you never to act like the ignorant one
Hud,38,-0.8188,0.219,0.781,0.0,noah said my lord take refuge with you that should ask you for that concerning which have no knowledge and if you do not forgive me and do not show mercy to me shall be among the loser
Hud,42,0.836,0.057,0.71,0.233,it wa said noah disembark with our peace and with blessing upon you and upon those who are with you there are also people whom we shall allow to enjoy themselves for while and then painful chastisement from u shall afflict them

Hud,31,0.4767,0.062,0.789,0.149,and to ad we sent their brother hud he said my people serve allah you have no god save him in attributing partner to allah you have merely been fabricating lie
Hud,24,0.802,0.07,0.633,0.297,my people seek no reward from you for my work my reward lie only with him who created me do you not understand anything
Hud,39,0.8658,0.045,0.704,0.252,my people ask your lord for forgiveness and turn to him in repentance he will shower abundant rain upon you from the heaven and will add strength to your strength do not turn away a those given to guilt
Hud,33,0.5719,0.0,0.865,0.135,they said hud you have not brought to u any clear evidence and we are not going to forsake our god merely because you say so we are not going to believe you
Hud,40,-0.5267,0.149,0.754,0.097,all we can say is that some god of ours ha afflicted you with evil hud said indeed take allah a my witness and you too to be my witness that have nothing to do with your associating with allah
Hud,18,0.3612,0.1,0.731,0.169,others than him in his divinity so conspire against me all of you and give me no respite
Hud,34,0.7096,0.055,0.744,0.201,have put my trust in allah who is my lord and your lord there is no moving creature which he doe not hold by it forelock surely my lord is on the straight path
Hud,50,-0.128,0.1,0.808,0.091,if you then turn away from the truth know that have delivered the message with which wa sent to you now my lord will set up another people in place of you and you shall in no way be able to harm him surely my lord keep watch over everything
Hud,30,0.7579,0.078,0.643,0.279,and when our com mand came to pas we delivered hud together with those who shared his faith out of special mercy from u we delivered them from woeful chastisement
Hud,24,-0.296,0.126,0.791,0.083,such were ad they repudiated the sign of their lord disobeyed his messenger and followed the bidding of every tyrannical enemy of the truth
Hud,32,-0.765,0.18,0.82,0.0,they were pursued by curse in this world and so will they be on the day of judgement lo ad disbelieved in the lord lo ruined are ad the people of hud
Hud,58,0.7506,0.034,0.802,0.164,and to thamud we sent their brother sali he said my people serve allah you have no god other than him he brought you into being out of the earth and ha made you dwell in it so ask him to forgive you and do turn towards him in repentance indeed my lord is near responsive to prayer
Hud,45,0.765,0.092,0.69,0.218,they said salih until now you were one of those among u on whom we placed great hope now would you forbid u to worship what our forefather were wont to worship indeed we are in disquieting doubt about what you are calling u to
Hud,45,0.3612,0.109,0.737,0.155,salih said my people what do you think if had clear evidence from my lord and then he also bestowed his mercy upon me who will rescue me from the punishment of allah if still disobey him you can only make me lose even more
Hud,35,0.7163,0.0,0.847,0.153,my people this she camel of allah is sign for you so let her pasture on allah earth and do not hurt her or else some chastisement which is near at hand should overtake you
Hud,26,0.6808,0.081,0.699,0.22,but they slaughtered her thereupon salih warned them enjoy yourselves in your home for maximum of three day this is promise which shall not be belied
Hud,34,0.9349,0.066,0.535,0.399,then when our command came to pas we saved salih and those who shared his faith through our special mercy from the disgrace of that day truly your lord is all strong all mighty
Hud,19,0.3724,0.0,0.876,0.124,and the blast overtook those who were wont to do wrong and then they lay lifeless in their home
Hud,20,-0.7269,0.264,0.736,0.0,a though they had never lived there before oh verily the thamud denied their lord oh the thamud were destroyed
Hud,28,0.9022,0.0,0.665,0.335,indeed our messenger came to abraham bearing glad tidings they greeted him with peace and abraham answered back to them peace and hurriedly brought to them roasted calf
Hud,33,0.4812,0.03,0.879,0.091,when he perceived that their hand could not reach it he mistrusted them and felt afraid of them they said do not be afraid we have been sent to the people of lot
Hud,29,0.7096,0.0,0.821,0.179,and abraham wife wa standing by and on hearing this she laughed and we gave her the good news of the birth of isaac and after isaac of jacob
Hud,26,-0.128,0.15,0.717,0.134,she said woe is me shall bear child now that am an old woman and my husband is well advanced in year this is indeed strange
Hud,25,0.9468,0.0,0.549,0.451,they said do you wonder at allah decree allah mercy and his blessing be upon you people of the house surely he is praiseworthy glorious
Hud,26,-0.4588,0.192,0.714,0.094,thus when fear had left abraham and the good news had been conveyed to him he began to dispute with u concerning the people of lot
Hud,10,0.6597,0.0,0.597,0.403,surely abraham wa forbearing tenderhearted and oft turning to allah
Hud,40,0.3863,0.0,0.913,0.087,thereupon our angel said to him abraham desist from this for indeed your lord command ha come and chastisement which cannot be averted is about to befall them word literally suggest the purpose is merely to express sense of wonder
Hud,25,-0.7964,0.269,0.731,0.0,and when our messenger came to lot he wa perturbed by their coming and felt troubled on their account and said this is distressing day
Hud,52,0.2631,0.086,0.81,0.104,and his people came to him rushing before this they were wont to commit evil deed lot said my people here are my daughter they are purer for you have fear of allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guest is there not even one right minded person in your midst
Hud,22,0.6486,0.0,0.751,0.249,they said surely you already know that we have nothing to do with your daughter you also know well what we want
Hud,19,0.8625,0.0,0.586,0.414,he said would that had the strength to set you straight or could seek refuge in some powerful support
Hud,71,-0.6486,0.101,0.867,0.032,thereupon the angel said lot we indeed are messenger of your lord and your people will in no way be able to hurt you so depart with your family in part of the night and let no one of you turn around excepting your wife who shall not go for what will befall them shall also befall her in the morning their promised hour will come is not the morning near
Hud,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and when our command came to pas we turned the town upside down and rained on it stone of baked clay one on another
Hud,14,-0.121,0.175,0.677,0.148,marked from your lord nor is the punishment far off from the wrong doer
Hud,53,-0.6542,0.103,0.87,0.027,and to the people of midian we sent their brother shu ayb he said my people serve allah you have no god other than him and do not diminish the measure and weight indeed see that you are prospering now but fear for you the chastisement of an encompassing day in the future
Hud,26,0.0274,0.14,0.749,0.111,my people give full measure and weight with justice do not diminish the good of others and do not go about creating corruption in the land
Hud,25,0.743,0.0,0.785,0.215,the gain that allah let you retain are better for you if you indeed believe in any case have not been appointed keeper over you
Hud,45,0.8481,0.0,0.817,0.183,they replied shu ayb doe your prayer enjoin upon you that we should forsake the deity whom our forefather worshipped or that we should give up using our wealth a we please do you fancy that you and only you are forbearing and right directed
Hud,77,0.6749,0.084,0.779,0.137,shu ayb said my people what do you think if stand on clear evidence from my lord and he ha also provided me handsome provision from himself should be ungrateful to him and share your error and iniquity nor do desire to act contrary to what admonish you desire nothing but to set thing right a far a can my succour is only with allah in him have put my trust and to him do always turn
Hud,49,-0.4767,0.08,0.92,0.0,my people let not your opposition to me lead you to guilt that would bring upon you the chastisement that struck earlier the people of noah and the people of hud and the people of salih and the land of the people of lot is not far from you

Hud,41,0.25,0.108,0.763,0.129,they said shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say indeed we see you weak in our midst were it not for your kinsman we would surely have stoned you for you have no strength to overpower u
Hud,35,0.4404,0.0,0.921,0.079,shu ayb said my people are my kinsman mightier with you than allah that you hold the kinsman in awe while you cast allah behind your back surely my lord encompasses all what you do
Hud,41,-0.7906,0.174,0.826,0.0,my people go on working according to your way and will keep working according to mine soon you will come to know who will be afflicted by humiliating chastisement and who is proved liar and watch shall also watch with you
Hud,38,0.743,0.067,0.71,0.224,and when our command came to pas we delivered shu ayb and those who shared his faith through our mercy and the blast seized those who were engaged in wrong doing so they lay lifeless in their home
Hud,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a though they had never dwelt in them before lo away with the people of midian even a the thamud were done away with
Hud,12,0.4404,0.0,0.719,0.281,and indeed we sent moses with our sign and with clear authority
Hud,20,0.25,0.0,0.905,0.095,to pharaoh and his noble but they obeyed the command of pharaoh even though pharaoh command wa not rightly directed
Hud,29,-0.34,0.079,0.921,0.0,he shall stand at the head of his people on the day of resurrection and will bring them down to the fire what wretched destination to be led to
Hud,25,-0.6369,0.235,0.655,0.11,they were pursued by curse in this world and so will they be on the day of resurrection what an evil reward will they receive
Hud,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is an account of some town which we recount to you of them some are still standing and some have been mown down
Hud,45,-0.4671,0.128,0.783,0.089,we did not wrong them it is rather they who wronged themselves and when the command of your lord came to pas the god besides allah whom they had called upon did not avail them in the least they added nothing to them except ruin
Hud,23,-0.8442,0.313,0.687,0.0,such is the seizing of your lord that when he doe seize the town immersed in wrong doing his seizing is painful terrible
Hud,37,-0.0772,0.078,0.852,0.071,surely in that is sign for him who fear the chastisement of the hereafter that will be day when all men shall be mustered together that will be day when whatever happens shall be witnessed by all

Hud,31,0.7096,0.117,0.62,0.263,prophet have no doubt about what they worship for they worship what their father worshipped before and yet we shall grant them their due portion in full diminishing of it nothing
Hud,57,-0.6124,0.121,0.823,0.056,and we certainly gave moses the book before and there arose disagreement about it even a there are disagreement now about the book revealed to you had it not been for decree that had already gone forth from your lord the matter would have long been decided between them indeed they are in disquieting doubt about it
Hud,23,0.6124,0.0,0.808,0.192,surely your lord will recompense all to the full for their deed for indeed he is well aware of all what they do
Hud,53,0.765,0.026,0.816,0.158,so remain muhammad you and those who have returned with you to the fold of faith and obedience from unbelief and rebellion steadfast in adhering to the straight way a you were commanded and do not exceed the limit of service to allah for certainly he is aware of all what you do

Yusuf,69,0.872,0.0,0.853,0.147,a you have seen in the dream so will your lord choose you for his task and will impart to you the comprehension of the deeper meaning of thing and will bestow the full measure of his favour upon you and upon the house of jacob even a he earlier bestowed it in full measure upon your forefather abraham and isaac surely your lord is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,20,0.3182,0.0,0.892,0.108,verily in the story of joseph and his brother there are many sign for those who inquire about the truth
Yusuf,38,0.7184,0.056,0.756,0.189,and call to mind when the brother of joseph conferred together and said surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are although we are group of so many our father is clearly mistaken
Yusuf,26,-0.7165,0.166,0.834,0.0,so either kill joseph or cast him into some distant land so that your father attention may become exclusively yours and after so doing become righteous
Yusuf,38,0.3333,0.0,0.94,0.06,thereupon one of them said do not kill joseph but if you are bent upon doing something cast him down to the bottom of some dark pit perhaps some caravan passing by will take him out of it
Yusuf,26,0.2955,0.091,0.743,0.166,after so deciding they said to their father why is it that you do not trust u regarding joseph although we are his true well wishers
Yusuf,22,0.6808,0.0,0.772,0.228,send him out with u tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play while we will be there standing guard over him
Yusuf,29,-0.7506,0.192,0.808,0.0,their father answered it grief me indeed that you should take him with you for fear that some wolf might eat him up while you are negligent of him
Yusuf,19,0.1027,0.125,0.733,0.142,they said should wolf eat him despite the presence of our strong group we would indeed be worthless lot
Yusuf,46,0.4404,0.0,0.939,0.061,so when they went away with joseph and decided to cast him in the bottom of the dark pit we revealed to joseph surely time will come when you will remind them of their deed they know nothing about the consequence of what they are doing
Yusuf,8,-0.4404,0.293,0.707,0.0,at nightfall they came to their father weeping
Yusuf,37,-0.357,0.066,0.934,0.0,and said father we went racing with one another and left joseph behind with our thing and then wolf came and ate him up we know that you will not believe u howsoever truthful we might be
Yusuf,52,0.5815,0.132,0.664,0.204,and they brought joseph shirt stained with false blood seeing this their father exclaimed nay this is not true rather your evil soul have made it easy for you to commit heinous act so will bear this patiently and in good grace it is allah help alone that seek against your fabrication
Yusuf,53,0.5423,0.046,0.829,0.125,and caravan came and they sent their water drawer to draw water a he let down his bucket in the well he observed joseph and cried out this is good news there is boy they concealed him considering him a part of their merchandise while allah wa well aware of what they did
Yusuf,18,-0.3875,0.134,0.866,0.0,later they sold him for paltry sum just few dirham they did not care to obtain higher price
Yusuf,73,0.9042,0.0,0.833,0.167,the man from egypt who bought him said to his wife take good care of him possibly he might be of benefit to u or we might adopt him a son thus we found way for joseph to become established in that land and in order that we might teach him to comprehend the deeper meaning of thing allah ha full power to implement his design although most people do not know that
Yusuf,22,0.8402,0.0,0.643,0.357,and when joseph reached the age of maturity we granted him judgement and knowledge thus do we reward those who do good
Yusuf,58,-0.4552,0.128,0.757,0.114,and it so happened that the lady in whose house joseph wa living sought to tempt him to herself and one day bolting the door she said come on now joseph answered may allah grant me refuge my lord ha provided an honourable abode for me so how can do something so evil such wrong doer never prosper
Yusuf,48,-0.4767,0.113,0.813,0.074,and she advanced towards him and had joseph not perceived sign from his lord he too would have advanced towards her thus wa joseph shown sign from his lord that we might avert from him all evil and indecency for indeed he wa one of our chosen servant
Yusuf,65,-0.7717,0.126,0.841,0.033,then both of them rushed to the door each seeking to get ahead of the other and she tore joseph shirt from behind then both of them found the husband of the lady at the door seeing him she said what should be the punishment of him who ha foul design on your wife except that he should be imprisoned or subjected to painful chastisement
Yusuf,44,-0.4588,0.109,0.844,0.047,joseph said it is she who wa trying to tempt me to herself and witness belonging to her own household testified on ground of circumstantial evidence if his shirt is torn from the front then she is telling the truth and he is liar
Yusuf,16,0.296,0.236,0.48,0.284,but if his shirt is torn from behind then she ha lied and he is truthful
Yusuf,27,0.6808,0.132,0.659,0.21,so when the husband saw joseph shirt torn from behind he exclaimed surely this is one of the trick of you woman your trick are indeed great
Yusuf,21,-0.5994,0.291,0.554,0.156,joseph disregard this and you woman ask forgiveness for your sin for indeed it is you who ha been at fault
Yusuf,29,0.1531,0.165,0.654,0.181,and some lady in the city began to say the chief wife violently in love with her houseboy is out to tempt him we think she is clearly mistaken
Yusuf,73,-0.2951,0.118,0.803,0.078,hearing of their sly talk the chief wife sent for those lady and arranged for them banquet and got ready couch and gave each guest knife then while they were cutting and eating the fruit she signalled joseph come out to them when the lady saw him they were so struck with admiration that they cut their hand exclaiming allah preserve u this is no mortal human this is nothing but noble angel
Yusuf,42,-0.6124,0.144,0.793,0.063,she said so now you see this is the one regarding whom you reproached me indeed tried to tempt him to myself but he held back although if he were not to follow my order he would certainly be imprisoned and humiliated
Yusuf,35,0.2542,0.064,0.82,0.116,joseph said my lord prefer imprisonment to what they ask me to do and if you do not avert from me the guile of these woman will succumb to their attraction and lapse into ignorance
Yusuf,20,0.3818,0.136,0.661,0.202,thereupon his lord granted his prayer and averted their guile from him surely he alone is all hearing all knowing
Yusuf,30,-0.5423,0.198,0.668,0.134,then it occurred to them to cast joseph into prison for while even though they had seen clear sign of joseph innocence and of the evil way of their lady
Yusuf,56,0.1531,0.055,0.864,0.081,and with joseph two other slave entered the prison one of them said saw myself pressing wine in dream and the other said saw myself carrying bread on my head of which the bird were eating both said tell u what is it interpretation for we consider you to be one of those who do good
Yusuf,51,-0.1027,0.045,0.918,0.037,joseph said will inform you about the interpretation of the dream before the arrival of the food that is sent to you this knowledge is part of what have been taught by my lord have renounced the way of those who do not believe in allah and who deny the hereafter
Yusuf,58,0.6242,0.04,0.854,0.107,and have adopted the way of my forefather abraham and isaac and jacob it is not for u to associate any with allah in his divinity it is out of allah grace upon u and upon mankind that he did not require of u to serve any other than allah and yet most people do not give thanks
Yusuf,17,0.2023,0.154,0.614,0.232,fellow prisoner is it better that there be diverse lord or just allah the one the irresistible
Yusuf,55,-0.09,0.039,0.911,0.05,those whom you serve beside him are merely idle name that you and your father have fabricated without allah sending down any sanction for them all authority to govern rest only with allah he ha commanded that you serve none but him this is the right way of life though most people are altogether unaware
Yusuf,47,-0.0258,0.069,0.845,0.086,fellow prisoner this is the interpretation of your dream one of you will serve wine to his lord the king of egypt a for the other he will be crucified and bird will eat of his head the question concerning what you asked ha thus been decided
Yusuf,47,-0.7845,0.167,0.793,0.04,and joseph said to the one of the two prisoner who he knew would be set free mention me in your lord presence but satan caused him to forget mentioning this to his lord the ruler of egypt and so joseph languished in prison for several year
Yusuf,55,0.872,0.0,0.808,0.192,and once the king said have dreamt that there are seven fat cow and seven lean cow are devouring them and there are seven fresh green ear of corn and seven others dry and withered my noble tell me what is the interpretation of this dream if you are well versed in interpretation of dream
Yusuf,16,0.1779,0.119,0.674,0.207,they said these are confused dream and we do not know the interpretation of such dream
Yusuf,41,-0.3071,0.138,0.75,0.112,then of the two prisoner the one who had been set free now remembered after the lapse of long period what joseph had said he said will tell you the interpretation of this dream just send me to joseph in prison
Yusuf,55,0.7579,0.0,0.874,0.126,then he went to joseph and said to him joseph truthfulness incarnate tell the true meaning of the dream in which seven fat cow are devoured by seven lean one and there are seven green ear of corn and seven others dry and withered so that may return to the people and they may learn
Yusuf,27,-0.0516,0.044,0.956,0.0,joseph said you will cultivate consecutively for seven year leave in the ear all that you have harvested except the little out of which you may eat
Yusuf,28,0.4215,0.071,0.802,0.127,then there will follow seven year of great hardship in which you will eat up all you have stored earlier except the little that you may set aside
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then there will come year when people will be helped by plenty of rain and they will press grape
Yusuf,46,0.8625,0.047,0.751,0.201,the king said bring this man to me but when the royal messenger came to joseph he said go back to your master and ask him about the case of the woman who had cut their hand surely my lord ha full knowledge of their guile
Yusuf,46,-0.296,0.157,0.707,0.136,thereupon the king asked the woman what happened when you sought to tempt joseph they said allah forbid we found no evil in him the chief wife said now the truth ha come to light it wa who sought to tempt him he is indeed truthful
Yusuf,32,0.7097,0.045,0.779,0.176,joseph said did this so that he the chief may know that did not betray him in his absence and that allah doe not allow the design of the treacherous to succeed
Yusuf,31,0.32,0.149,0.645,0.206,do not seek to acquit myself for surely one self prompt one to evil except him to whom my lord may show mercy verily my lord is ever forgiving most merciful
Yusuf,35,0.5256,0.0,0.907,0.093,the king said bring him to me will select him exclusively for my own service so when joseph spoke to him the king said you are now one of established position fully trusted by u
Yusuf,20,0.7351,0.0,0.702,0.298,joseph said place me in charge of the treasure of the land am good keeper and know my task well
Yusuf,43,0.7719,0.105,0.651,0.244,thus did we establish joseph in the land so that he could settle wherever he pleased we bestow favour out of our mercy on whomsoever we please and we do not cause the reward of those who do good to go to waste
Yusuf,18,0.7845,0.131,0.459,0.41,surely the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and act in god fearing way
Yusuf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and joseph brother came to egypt and presented themselves before him he recognized them but they did not know him
Yusuf,32,0.2263,0.0,0.942,0.058,and when he had prepared for them their provision joseph said bring to me your other brother from your father do you not see that give full measure and am most hospitable
Yusuf,25,-0.296,0.084,0.916,0.0,if you do not bring him to me you shall have no corn from me and do not even attempt to come close to me
Yusuf,20,0.6369,0.0,0.776,0.224,they said we will surely try to prevail over our father to send him be sure we shall do so
Yusuf,46,0.8658,0.0,0.797,0.203,and joseph said to his servant put surreptitiously in their pack the good they had given in exchange for corn joseph did so expecting that they would find it when they returned home feeling grateful for this generosity they might be inclined to return to him
Yusuf,36,-0.1531,0.076,0.864,0.06,when they returned to their father they said father we have been denied further supply of corn so send with u our brother that we may bring the supply we shall be responsible for his protection
Yusuf,30,0.891,0.0,0.71,0.29,the father said shall trust you with regard to him a had trusted you earlier with regard to his brother allah is the best protector and is the most merciful
Yusuf,66,0.9118,0.034,0.755,0.211,and when they opened their thing they found that their good had been given back to them thereupon they cried father what else would we desire look even our good have been given back to u so we shall go now and bring supply for our family we shall protect our brother and bring another camel load of corn that additional supply will be easily secured
Yusuf,51,0.4588,0.048,0.867,0.085,their father said shall never send him with you until you give me solemn promise in the name of allah that you will bring him back to me unless you yourselves are surrounded then after they had given him their solemn promise he said allah watch over what we have said
Yusuf,51,0.836,0.069,0.734,0.197,and he enjoined them my son do not enter the city by one gate rather enter it by different gate can be of no help to you against allah allah command alone prevails in him have put my trust and in him should all those who have faith put their trust
Yusuf,66,-0.3384,0.08,0.875,0.045,and it so happened that when they entered the city by many gate a their father had directed them this precautionary measure proved ineffective against allah will there wa an uneasiness in jacob soul which he so tried to remove surely he wa possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that we bestowed upon him but most people do not know the truth of the matter
Yusuf,32,0.3501,0.0,0.927,0.073,when they presented themselves before joseph he took his brother aside to himself and said verily am your own brother joseph so do not grieve over the manner they have treated you
Yusuf,25,-0.7184,0.207,0.793,0.0,then while joseph wa having their provision loaded he put his drinking cup in his brother saddlebag and then herald cried traveller you are thief
Yusuf,8,-0.3182,0.247,0.753,0.0,turning back they asked what have you lost
Yusuf,25,-0.0772,0.084,0.842,0.073,the official said we have lost the king cup and their chief added he who brings it shall have camel load of provision guarantee that
Yusuf,24,-0.2023,0.116,0.797,0.087,they said by allah you certainly know that we did not come to act corruptly in this land nor are we those who steal
Yusuf,17,-0.802,0.384,0.52,0.096,the official said if you are lying what will be the penalty for him who ha stolen
Yusuf,23,-0.7579,0.236,0.764,0.0,they replied he in whose saddlebag the cup is found he himself shall be it recompense thus do we punish the wrong doer
Yusuf,75,0.5267,0.028,0.902,0.07,then joseph began searching their bag before searching his own brother bag then he brought forth the drinking cup from his brother bag thus did we contrive to support joseph he had no right according to the religion of the king the law of egypt to take his brother unless allah so willed we exalt whomsoever we will over others by several degree and above all those who know is the one who truly know
Yusuf,53,-0.9265,0.261,0.699,0.04,they said no wonder that he steal for brother of his stole before but joseph kept his reaction to himself without disclosing the truth to them he merely said to himself you are an evil lot allah know well the truth of the accusation that you are making against me to my face
Yusuf,35,0.7227,0.077,0.703,0.219,they said powerful chief al aziz his father is an age stricken man and in order that he may not suffer seize one of u in his stead we indeed consider you an excellent person
Yusuf,31,0.1689,0.14,0.702,0.158,joseph said allah forbid that we should seize any except him with whom we found our good were we to do so we would surely be one of the wrong doer
Yusuf,73,0.5423,0.096,0.767,0.137,then when they had despaired of joseph they went to corner and counselled together the eldest of them said do you not know that your father ha taken solemn promise from you in the name of allah and you failed in your duty towards joseph so will not depart from this land until my father permit me or allah pronounces his judgement in my favour he is the best of those who judge
Yusuf,48,-0.7184,0.175,0.762,0.063,so go back to your father and tell him father your son ha certainly been guilty of stealing we did not see him stealing but testify according to what we know and obviously we had no power to keep watch over that what is altogether hidden from u
Yusuf,31,0.5106,0.0,0.871,0.129,you may inquire of the dweller of the city where we were and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled we are altogether truthful in what we say
Yusuf,48,0.9617,0.0,0.698,0.302,the father heard the narration and said all that is untrue but your soul have made it easy for you to engage in heinous act so will be graciously patient even at this allah may well bring them all back to me he is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,30,-0.9442,0.392,0.608,0.0,then he turned his back to them and said my grief for joseph his eye whitened with grief and he wa choked up with sorrow trying to suppress his grief
Yusuf,22,-0.7964,0.262,0.738,0.0,the son said by allah you will continue to remember joseph until you will either consume yourself with grief or will die
Yusuf,20,-0.765,0.268,0.732,0.0,he said will address my sorrow and grief only to allah and know from allah what you do not know
Yusuf,28,0.786,0.0,0.729,0.271,my son go and try to find out about joseph and his brother and do not despair of allah mercy verily only the unbeliever despair of allah mercy
Yusuf,48,0.5859,0.097,0.737,0.165,on going to egypt they presented themselves to joseph and said to him chief we and our family are struck with distress and have brought only paltry sum so give u corn in full measure and give it to u in charity allah reward those who are charitable
Yusuf,26,-0.2732,0.077,0.923,0.0,when joseph heard this he could not hold himself and said do you remember what you did to joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
Yusuf,43,0.2349,0.19,0.604,0.206,they exclaimed are you indeed joseph he said yes am joseph and this is my brother allah ha surely been gracious to u indeed whoever fear allah and remains patient allah doe not allow the reward of such people to go to waste
Yusuf,20,0.3182,0.165,0.617,0.218,they said we swear by allah indeed allah ha chosen you in preference to u and we were truly guilty
Yusuf,23,-0.3612,0.172,0.749,0.079,he replied no blame lie with you today may allah forgive you he is the most merciful of all those that are merciful
Yusuf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father face he will regain his sight and bring to me all your family
Yusuf,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and a the caravan set out from egypt their father said in canaan indeed smell the fragrance of joseph say so although you may think that am doting
Yusuf,11,0.3182,0.119,0.667,0.215,they said surely you are still in your same old craze
Yusuf,35,0.4404,0.0,0.921,0.079,and when the bearer of good news came he threw joseph shirt over jacob face whereupon he regained his sight and said did not tell you that know from allah what you do not know
Yusuf,14,-0.0258,0.282,0.396,0.322,they said father pray for the forgiveness of our sin we were truly guilty
Yusuf,21,0.6486,0.076,0.646,0.278,he said shall pray to my lord for your forgiveness for he and indeed he alone is ever forgiving most merciful
Yusuf,31,0.34,0.0,0.926,0.074,and when they went to joseph he took his parent aside and said to the member of his family enter the city now and if allah will you shall be secure
Yusuf,90,0.8979,0.057,0.765,0.178,and after they had entered the city joseph raised his parent to the throne beside himself and they involuntarily bowed in prostration before him joseph said father this is the fulfilment of the vision had before one that my lord ha caused to come true he wa kind to me when he rescued me from the prison and brought you from the desert after satan had stirred discord between me and my brother certainly my lord is subtle in the fulfilment of his will he is all knowing all wise
Yusuf,51,0.1531,0.068,0.836,0.096,my lord you have bestowed dominion upon me and have taught me to comprehend the depth of thing creator of heaven and earth you are my guardian in this world and in the hereafter cause me to die in submission to you and join me in the end with the righteous
Yusuf,28,0.1779,0.0,0.941,0.059,muhammad this is part of news from the unseen that we reveal to you for you were not present with them when joseph brother jointly resolved on plot
Yusuf,15,0.541,0.0,0.8,0.2,and most of the people howsoever you might so desire are not going to believe
Yusuf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you do not seek from them any recompense for your service this is merely an admonition to all mankind
Yusuf,19,0.3103,0.091,0.761,0.148,how many are the sign in the heaven and the earth which people pas by without giving any heed
Yusuf,17,0.5719,0.0,0.812,0.188,and most of them believe in allah only when they associate others with him in his divinity
Yusuf,27,0.34,0.0,0.915,0.085,do they then feel secure that an overwhelming chastisement shall not visit them and the hour shall not suddenly come upon them without their even perceiving it
Yusuf,47,0.9201,0.0,0.766,0.234,tell them plainly this is my way call you to allah on the basis of clear perception both and those who follow me allah glory be to him is free of every imperfection have nothing to do with those who associate others with allah in his divinity
Yusuf,77,0.3387,0.071,0.82,0.11,the messenger whom we raised before you muhammad and to whom we sent down revelation were only human being and were from among those living in earthly habitation have these people not travelled in the earth that they may observe the end of their predecessor certainly the abode of the hereafter is much better for those who accepted the call of the messenger and acted in god fearing manner will you still not act with good sense
Yusuf,68,-0.3565,0.113,0.793,0.094,it also happened with the earlier messenger that for long they preached and people paid no heed until the messenger despaired of their people and the people also fancied that they had been told lie by the messenger then suddenly our help came to the messenger and when such an occasion come we rescue whom we will a for the guilty our chastisement cannot be averted from them
Yusuf,49,0.6705,0.04,0.82,0.14,certainly in the story of the bygone people there is lesson for people of understanding what is being narrated in the qur an is no fabrication it is rather confirmation of the book that preceded it and detailed exposition of everything and guidance and mercy for people of faith
Ar-Rad,33,0.8074,0.0,0.783,0.217,alif lam mim ra these are the verse of the divine book whatever ha been revealed to you from your lord is the truth and yet most of your people do not believe
Ar-Rad,71,0.8818,0.028,0.805,0.167,it is allah who ha raised the heaven without any support that you could see and then he established himself on the throne of dominion and he it is who ha made the sun and the moon subservient to law each running it course till an appointed term he governs the entire order of the universe and clearly explains the sign that you may be firmly convinced about meeting your lord
Ar-Rad,55,0.8885,0.0,0.8,0.2,he it is who ha stretched out the earth and ha placed in it firm mountain and ha caused the river to flow he ha made every fruit in pair two and two and he it is who cause the night to cover the day surely there are sign in these for those who reflect
Ar-Rad,62,0.6808,0.03,0.858,0.112,and on the earth there are many tract of land neighbouring each other there are on it vineyard and sown field and date palm some growing in cluster from one root some standing alone they are irrigated by the same water and yet we make some excel others in taste surely there are sign in these for people who use their reason
Ar-Rad,62,-0.1027,0.037,0.932,0.031,and were you to wonder then wondrous indeed is the saying of those who say what after we have been reduced to dust shall we be created afresh they are the one who disbelieved in their lord they are the one who shall have shackle around their neck they shall be the inmate of the fire wherein they will abide for ever
Ar-Rad,51,-0.0119,0.156,0.658,0.186,they challenge you to hasten the coming of evil upon them before the coming of any good although people who followed like course before had met with exemplary punishment from allah verily your lord is forgiving to mankind despite all their wrong doing verily your lord is also severe in retribution
Ar-Rad,31,0.1027,0.122,0.746,0.133,those who refused to believe in you say why ha no miraculous sign been sent down upon him from his lord you are only warner and every people ha it guide
Ar-Rad,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,allah know what every female bear and what the womb fall short of in gestation and what they may add with him everything is in fixed measure
Ar-Rad,18,0.5574,0.0,0.825,0.175,he know both what is hidden and what is manifest he is the supreme one the most high
Ar-Rad,34,-0.4019,0.104,0.896,0.0,it is all the same for him whether any of you say thing secretly or say it loudly and whether one hide oneself in the darkness of night or strut about in broad daylight

An-Nahl,18,0.8481,0.083,0.489,0.429,surely he ha no power over those who have faith and who place their trust in their lord
An-Nahl,24,0.7269,0.0,0.775,0.225,he ha power only over those who take him a their patron and who under his influence associate others with allah in his divinity

An-Nahl,27,0.0772,0.093,0.772,0.135,surely allah will not enable those who do not believe in the sign of allah to be directed to the right way and painful chastisement awaits them
An-Nahl,27,-0.5106,0.113,0.887,0.0,it is not the prophet who invents lie it is rather those who do not believe in the sign of allah who invent lie they are liar

An-Nahl,28,0.6249,0.085,0.712,0.202,that is because they love the life of this world more than the hereafter and allah doe not guide those who are ungrateful to allah for his favour

An-Nahl,29,0.2484,0.169,0.663,0.168,and surely your lord will be most forgiving and most merciful towards those who left their home after they were persecuted and who thereafter struggled hard and remained constant
An-Nahl,35,0.4226,0.0,0.897,0.103,allah judgement will come about them all on the day when everyone shall come pleading in his defence and everyone shall be fully requited for his deed and none shall be wronged in the least
An-Nahl,52,-0.9689,0.304,0.671,0.025,allah set forth the parable of the people of town who were secure and content and whose sustenance came in abundance from every quarter but then the people of the town showed ingratitude towards allah for his bounty so allah afflicted them with hunger and fear in punishment for their evil deed
An-Nahl,26,-0.8642,0.331,0.532,0.137,most certainly messenger came to them from among them but they rejected him calling him liar therefore chastisement seized them while they engaged in wrong doing
An-Nahl,28,0.7783,0.0,0.762,0.238,so eat out of the lawful and good sustenance that allah ha bestowed upon you and thank allah for his bounty if it is him that you serve
An-Nahl,56,0.8898,0.029,0.765,0.206,allah ha forbidden you only carrion and blood and the flesh of swine also any animal over which the name of any other than allah ha been pronounced but whoever eats of them under compelling necessity neither desiring it nor exceeding the limit of absolute necessity surely for such action allah is much forgiving most merciful
An-Nahl,32,0.4404,0.0,0.914,0.086,and do not utter falsehood by letting your tongue declare this is lawful and that is unlawful thus fabricating lie against allah surely those who fabricate lie against allah will never prosper

An-Nahl,14,0.3818,0.16,0.55,0.29,for surely allah is with those who hold him in fear and do good
Al-Isra,43,0.4404,0.043,0.874,0.083,holy is he who carried his servant by night from the holy mosque in makkah to the farther mosque in jerusalem whose surroundings we have blessed that we might show him some of our sign indeed he alone is all hearing all seeing

Al-Isra,24,0.34,0.088,0.739,0.173,then we clearly declared to the child of israel in the book twice you will make mischief in the land and will commit transgression
Al-Isra,42,0.6249,0.0,0.887,0.113,so when the occasion for the first of the transgression arrived we raised against you some of our creature who were full of might and they ran over the whole of your land this wa promise that wa bound to be fulfilled
Al-Isra,20,0.8885,0.0,0.545,0.455,then we granted you an upper hand against them and strengthened you with wealth and child and multiplied your number
Al-Isra,64,-0.5719,0.176,0.669,0.155,whenever you did good it wa to your own advantage and whenever you committed evil it wa to your own disadvantage so when the time of the fulfilment of the second promise arrived we raised other enemy that would disfigure your face and enter the temple of jerusalem a they had entered the first time and destroy whatever they could lay their hand on
Al-Isra,35,-0.969,0.388,0.549,0.062,your lord may well show mercy to you but if you revert to your evil behaviour we shall revert to chastising you we have made hell prison for those who are thankless of allah bounty

Al-Kahf,28,0.0531,0.072,0.85,0.079,thing about which they have no knowledge neither they nor their ancestor dreadful is the word that come out of their mouth what they utter is merely lie
Al-Kahf,21,-0.8689,0.353,0.647,0.0,muhammad if they do not believe in this message you will perhaps torment yourself to death with grief sorrowing over them
Al-Kahf,28,0.7003,0.0,0.812,0.188,surely we have made all that is on the earth an embellishment for it in order to test people a to who of them is better in conduct
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in the ultimate we shall reduce all that is on the earth to barren plain
Al-Kahf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do you think that the people of the cave and the inscription were one of our wondrous sign
Al-Kahf,25,0.6124,0.0,0.808,0.192,when those youth sought refuge in the cave and said our lord grant u mercy from yourself and provide for u rectitude in our affair
Al-Kahf,12,0.0772,0.0,0.894,0.106,we lulled them to sleep in that cave for number of year
Al-Kahf,22,0.7845,0.0,0.743,0.257,and then roused them so that we might see which of the two party could best tell the length of their stay
Al-Kahf,25,0.8555,0.0,0.669,0.331,we narrate to you their true story they were party of young men who had faith in their lord and we increased them in guidance
Al-Kahf,40,0.7184,0.047,0.776,0.177,and strengthened their heart when they stood up and proclaimed our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth we shall call upon no other god beside him for if we did so we shall be uttering blasphemy
Al-Kahf,44,-0.3771,0.118,0.796,0.086,then they conferred among themselves and said these men our own people have taken others a god beside him why do they not bring any clear evidence that they indeed are god who can be more unjust than he who foists lie on allah
Al-Kahf,44,0.6597,0.0,0.865,0.135,and now that you have dissociated yourselves from them and from whatever they worship beside allah go and seek refuge in the cave your lord will extend his mercy to you and will provide for you the mean for the disposal of your affair
Al-Kahf,80,-0.4939,0.051,0.949,0.0,had you seen them in the cave it would have appeared to you that when the sun rose it moved away from their cave to the right and when it set it turned away from them to the left while they remained in spacious hollow in the cave this is one of the sign of allah whomsoever allah guide he alone is led aright and whomsoever allah let go astray you will find for him no guardian to direct him
Al-Kahf,62,-0.25,0.052,0.912,0.036,on seeing them you would fancy them to be awake though they were asleep and we caused them to turn their side to their right and to their left and their dog sat stretching out it foreleg on the threshold of the cave had you looked upon them you would have certainly fled away from them their sight filling you with terror
Al-Kahf,92,0.8442,0.014,0.89,0.096,likewise we roused them in miraculous way that they might question one another one of them asked how long did you remain in this state the others said we remained so for day or part of day then they said your lord know better how long we remained in this state now send one of you to the city with this coin of yours and let him see who ha the best food and let him buy some provision from there let him be cautious and not inform anyone of our whereabouts
Al-Kahf,26,-0.2732,0.141,0.758,0.101,for if they should come upon u they will stone u to death or force u to revert to their faith whereafter we shall never prosper
Al-Kahf,84,0.7914,0.093,0.754,0.153,thus did we make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that allah promise is true and that there is absolutely no doubt that the hour will come to pas but instead of giving thought to this they disputed with one another concerning the people of the cave some saying build wall over them their lord alone know best about them but those who prevailed over their affair said we shall build place of worship over them
Al-Kahf,76,0.5874,0.0,0.901,0.099,some will say concerning them they were three and their dog the fourth and some will say they were five and their dog the sixth all this being merely guesswork and still others will say they were seven and their dog the eighth say my lord know their number best only few know their correct number so do not dispute concerning their number but stick to what is evident and do not question anyone about them
Al-Kahf,10,0.34,0.0,0.789,0.211,and never say about anything shall certainly do this tomorrow
Al-Kahf,32,-0.2263,0.058,0.942,0.0,unless allah should will it and should you forget and make such statement remember your lord and say expect my lord to guide me to what is nearer to rectitude than this
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they remained in the cave for three hundred year and others added nine more year
Al-Kahf,47,0.8365,0.072,0.701,0.228,say allah know best how long they remained in it for only he know all that is hidden in the heaven and the earth how well he see how well he hears the creature have no other guardian than him he allows none to share his authority
Al-Kahf,39,0.0516,0.053,0.889,0.058,prophet recite to them from the book of your lord what ha been revealed to you for none may change his word and were you to make any change in his word you will find no refuge from him
Al-Kahf,61,0.7506,0.0,0.902,0.098,keep yourself content with those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his pleasure and do not let your eye pas beyond them do you seek the pomp and glitter of the world do not follow him whose heart we have caused to be heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose attitude is of excess
Al-Kahf,62,-0.8519,0.198,0.713,0.089,and proclaim this is the truth from your lord now let him who will believe and let him who will disbelieve we have prepared fire for the wrong doer whose billowing fold encompass them if they ask for water they will be served with drink like dreg of oil that will scald their face how dreadful drink and how evil an abode
Al-Kahf,17,-0.3395,0.25,0.613,0.137,a for those who believe and do good we shall not cause their reward to be lost
Al-Kahf,49,0.9442,0.0,0.715,0.285,they shall dwell in the garden of eternity beneath which stream flow there they will be adorned with bracelet of gold will be arrayed in green garment of silk and rich brocade and will recline on raised couch how excellent is their reward and how nice their resting place
Al-Kahf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,muhammad propound parable to them there were two men of whom we bestowed upon one of the two vineyard surrounding both of them with date palm and putting tillage in between
Al-Kahf,17,0.4023,0.0,0.856,0.144,both the vineyard yielded abundant produce without failure and we caused stream to flow in their midst
Al-Kahf,29,0.8225,0.0,0.723,0.277,so the owner had fruit in abundance and he said to his neighbour while conversing with him have greater wealth than you and am stronger than you in number
Al-Kahf,20,0.4404,0.0,0.868,0.132,then he entered his vine yard and said wronging himself surely do not believe that all this will ever perish
Al-Kahf,27,0.4404,0.0,0.9,0.1,nor do believe that the hour of resurrection will ever come to pas and even if am returned to my lord shall find better place than this
Al-Kahf,30,-0.3612,0.134,0.806,0.06,while conversing with him his neighbour exclaimed do you deny him who created you out of dust then out of drop of sperm and then fashioned you into complete man
Al-Kahf,17,0.4019,0.102,0.711,0.188,a for myself allah alone is my lord and associate none with my lord in his divinity
Al-Kahf,36,0.6369,0.053,0.793,0.154,when you entered your vineyard why did you not say whatever allah will shall come to pas for there is no power save with allah if you find me le than yourself in wealth and child
Al-Kahf,32,0.6705,0.072,0.716,0.212,it may well be that my lord will give me something better than your vineyard and send calamity upon your vineyard from the heaven and it will be reduced to barren waste
Al-Kahf,24,-0.3612,0.098,0.902,0.0,or the water of your vineyard will be drained deep into the ground so that you will not be able to seek it out
Al-Kahf,46,-0.5423,0.196,0.686,0.118,eventually all his produce wa destroyed and he began to wring his hand in sorrow at the loss of what he had spent on it and on seeing it fallen down upon it trellis saying would had not associated anyone with my lord in his divinity
Al-Kahf,19,0.4939,0.093,0.678,0.229,and there wa no host beside allah to help him nor could he be of any help to himself
Al-Kahf,28,0.9423,0.0,0.617,0.383,then he knew that all power of protection rest with allah the true one he is the best to reward the best to determine the end of thing
Al-Kahf,56,0.3291,0.041,0.878,0.08,prophet propound to them the parable of the present life it is like the vegetation of the earth which flourished luxuriantly when it mingled with the water that we sent down from the sky but after that the same vegetation turned into stubble which the wind blew about allah alone ha the power over all thing
Al-Kahf,35,0.9729,0.0,0.565,0.435,wealth and child are an adornment of the life of the world but the deed of lasting righteousness are the best in the sight of your lord in reward and far better source of hope
Al-Kahf,36,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,bear in mind the day when we shall set the mountain in motion and you will find the earth void and bare on that day we shall muster all men together leaving none of them behind
Al-Kahf,42,0.25,0.0,0.951,0.049,they shall be brought before your lord all lined up and shall be told now indeed you have come before u in the manner we created you in the first instance although you thought that we shall not appoint tryst with u
Al-Kahf,56,-0.9144,0.231,0.769,0.0,and then the record of their deed shall be placed before them and you will see the guilty full of fear for what it contains and will say woe to u what record this is it leaf nothing big or small but encompasses it they will find their deed confronting them your lord wrong no one
Al-Kahf,61,-0.9001,0.162,0.838,0.0,and recall when we said to the angel prostrate yourselves before adam all of them fell prostrate except iblis he wa of the jinni and so disobeyed the command of his lord will you then take him and his progeny a your guardian rather than me although they are your open enemy what an evil substitute are these wrong doer taking
Al-Kahf,30,0.7579,0.0,0.783,0.217,did not call them to witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor in their own creation do not seek the aid of those who lead people astray
Al-Kahf,48,-0.5499,0.07,0.93,0.0,what will such people do on the day when the lord will say now call upon all those whom you believed to be my partner thereupon they will call upon them but they will not respond to their call and we shall make them common pit of doom
Al-Kahf,24,-0.6908,0.254,0.687,0.058,and the guilty shall behold the fire and know that they are bound to fall into it and will find no escape from it
Al-Kahf,25,-0.2023,0.101,0.791,0.108,and surely we have explained matter to people in the qur an in diverse way using all manner of parable but man is exceedingly contentious
Al-Kahf,49,0.7351,0.0,0.843,0.157,what is it that prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that they would like to be treated a the nation of yore or that they would like to see the scourge come upon them face to face
Al-Kahf,33,0.1531,0.113,0.759,0.128,we raise messenger only to give good news and to warn but the unbeliever resort to falsehood in order to rebut the truth with it and scoff at my revelation and my warning
Al-Kahf,74,-0.1263,0.047,0.912,0.041,who is more wicked than the man who when he is reminded by the revelation of his lord turn away from them and forgets the consequence of the deed wrought by his own hand we have laid veil over their heart lest they understand the message of the qur an and we have caused heaviness in their ear call them a you may to the right path they will not be ever guided aright
Al-Kahf,41,0.7003,0.0,0.848,0.152,your lord is all forgiving full of mercy had he wished to take them to task for their doings he would have hastened in sending his scourge upon them but he ha set for them time limit which they cannot evade
Al-Kahf,27,-0.8519,0.332,0.557,0.111,all the township afflicted with scourge are before your eye when they committed wrong we destroyed them for the destruction of each we had set definite term
Al-Kahf,32,0.0258,0.0,0.966,0.034,and recount to them the story of moses when moses said to his servant will journey on until reach the point where the two river meet though may march on for age
Al-Kahf,27,0.1531,0.0,0.94,0.06,but when they reached the point where the two river meet they forgot their fish and it took it way into the sea a if through tunnel
Al-Kahf,22,0.128,0.099,0.782,0.119,when they had journeyed further on moses said to his servant bring u our repast we are surely fatigued by today journey
Al-Kahf,48,-0.4019,0.074,0.926,0.0,the servant said did you see what happened when we betook ourselves to the rock to take rest forgot the fish and it is only satan who caused me to forget to mention it to you so that it made it way into the sea in strange manner
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said that is what we were looking for so the two turned back retracing their footstep
Al-Kahf,25,0.6369,0.0,0.816,0.184,and there they found one of our servant upon whom we had bestowed our mercy and to whom we had imparted special knowledge from ourselves
Al-Kahf,21,0.5267,0.0,0.855,0.145,moses said to him may follow you that you may teach me something of the wisdom which you have been taught
Al-Kahf,12,0.4404,0.0,0.791,0.209,he answered you will surely not be able to bear with me
Al-Kahf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,for how can you patiently bear with something you cannot encompass in your knowledge
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses replied you shall find me if allah will patient and shall not disobey you in anything
Al-Kahf,19,0.2732,0.0,0.896,0.104,he said well if you follow me do not ask me concerning anything until myself mention it to you
Al-Kahf,42,-0.6786,0.147,0.802,0.051,then the two went forth until when they embarked on the boat he made hole in it whereupon moses exclaimed have you made hole in it so a to drown the people in the boat you have certainly done an awful thing
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he replied did not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me
Al-Kahf,18,0.0762,0.0,0.929,0.071,moses said do not take me to task at my forgetfulness and do not be hard on me
Al-Kahf,33,0.2023,0.09,0.773,0.137,then the two went forth until they met lad whom he slew whereupon moses exclaimed what have you slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone surely you have done horrible thing
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me
Al-Kahf,22,0.2006,0.087,0.794,0.119,moses said keep me no more in your company if question you concerning anything after this you will then be fully justified
Al-Kahf,57,0.0772,0.046,0.903,0.051,then the two went forth until when they came to town they asked it people for food but they refused to play host to them they found in that town wall that wa on the verge of tumbling down and he buttressed it whereupon moses said if you had wished you could have received payment for it
Al-Kahf,28,0.4215,0.0,0.906,0.094,he said this brings me and you to parting of way now shall explain to you the true meaning of thing about which you could not remain patient
Al-Kahf,37,-0.6369,0.152,0.797,0.051,a for the boat it belonged to some poor people who worked on the river and desired to damage it for beyond them lay the dominion of king who wa wont to seize every boat by force
Al-Kahf,22,-0.1027,0.128,0.76,0.112,a for the lad his parent were people of faith and we feared lest he should plague them with transgression and disbelief
Al-Kahf,20,0.5574,0.0,0.796,0.204,and we desired that their lord should grant them another in his place son more upright and more tender hearted
Al-Kahf,72,0.8271,0.0,0.872,0.128,a for the wall it belonged to two orphan boy in the city and under it there wa treasure that belonged to them their father wa righteous man and your lord intended that they should come of age and then bring forth their treasure a mercy from your lord did not do this of my own bidding this is the true meaning of thing with which you could not keep your patience
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,muhammad they ask you about dhu al qarnayn say will give you an account of him
Al-Kahf,15,0.25,0.0,0.875,0.125,we granted him power in the land and endowed him with all kind of resource

Al-Kahf,17,0.5994,0.138,0.567,0.296,say muhammad shall we tell you who will be the greatest loser in respect of their work
Al-Kahf,23,0.4404,0.0,0.884,0.116,it will be those whose effort went astray in the life of the world and who believe nevertheless that they are doing good
Al-Kahf,43,-0.5267,0.097,0.903,0.0,those are the one who refused to believe in the revelation of their lord and that they are bound to meet him hence all their deed have come to naught and we shall assign no weight to them on the day of resurrection

An-Naml,29,0.8807,0.0,0.682,0.318,on the other hand we granted knowledge to david and solomon and they said all praise be to allah who ha exalted u above many of his believing servant
An-Naml,32,0.8225,0.0,0.771,0.229,and solomon succeeded david and said people we have been taught the speech of bird and we have been endowed with all kind of thing surely this is conspicuous favour from allah
An-Naml,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,host of jinni and human and bird were marshalled for solomon and were kept under full control

An-Naml,56,0.9413,0.0,0.749,0.251,smiling at the ant utterance solomon burst into laughter and said my lord hold me under your control that may render thanks for the favour which you have bestowed on me and on my parent and that may act righteously in manner that would please you include me out of your mercy among your righteous servant
An-Naml,23,-0.2732,0.087,0.913,0.0,on another occasion solomon inspected the bird and said why is it that do not see the hoopoe is he among the absentee
An-Naml,21,-0.4767,0.219,0.679,0.102,will inflict severe punishment on him or maybe even slaughter him unless he come forth with convincing reason for his absence
An-Naml,24,0.3182,0.0,0.909,0.091,not before long the hoopoe came up and said have obtained knowledge which you could not have brought for you sure news about sheba

An-Naml,39,0.6562,0.052,0.777,0.171,found that she and her people prostrate themselves before the sun rather than allah satan ha made their deed appear attractive to them and ha thus debarred them from the right path so they do not find true guidance
An-Naml,32,0.5106,0.0,0.904,0.096,that they would prostrate themselves before allah who brings to light all that is hidden in the heaven and the earth and know all that you conceal and all that you reveal

An-Naml,19,0.3182,0.0,0.887,0.113,solomon said soon shall we see whether you have spoken the truth or are one of those that lie
An-Naml,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,take this letter of mine deliver it to them and then draw back from them and observe what they do

An-Naml,18,0.5413,0.0,0.83,0.17,it is from solomon and it is in the name of allah the most merciful the most compassionate
An-Naml,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it say do not act towards me with defiance but come to me in submission
An-Naml,23,0.2323,0.084,0.76,0.157,after reading the letter the queen said noble let me have your counsel in this matter for make no firm decision without you
An-Naml,24,0.5647,0.062,0.746,0.192,they said we are strong and are given to vehement fighting but the decision is yours therefore consider what you would like to command
An-Naml,32,0.5719,0.0,0.893,0.107,the queen said when the king enter country they cause corruption in it and abase those of it people who are held in honour this is what they are wont to do
An-Naml,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,will send them gift and then see with what answer my envoy return
An-Naml,44,0.9042,0.0,0.728,0.272,now when the envoy of the queen came to solomon he said do you want to aid me with wealth whatever allah ha granted me is much more than what he ha given you keep for yourselves your gift in which you are exulting
An-Naml,38,-0.8402,0.222,0.726,0.051,envoy go back to those who sent you and we shall certainly come upon them with host whom they will be unable to resist we shall drive them out from there and they will suffer humiliation and disgrace
An-Naml,19,0.4588,0.0,0.857,0.143,solomon said my noble which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission
An-Naml,26,0.7759,0.0,0.78,0.22,stalwart of the jinni said will bring it to you before you rise from your council surely have the power to do so and am trustworthy
An-Naml,79,0.7184,0.062,0.809,0.129,and he who had some knowledge of the book said will bring it before the twinkling of your eye when solomon saw the throne placed firmly beside him he cried out this is by the grace of my lord so that he may test me whether give thanks for his bounty or act with ingratitude whoever is grateful is so to his own good and whoever is ungrateful let him know that my lord is immensely resourceful most bountiful
An-Naml,31,0.4588,0.0,0.875,0.125,solomon said set the throne before her casually and let u see whether she get to the truth or is one of those who are not guided to what is right
An-Naml,35,0.3612,0.0,0.93,0.07,when the queen arrived she wa asked is your throne like this one she said it seems a if it is the same we had already come to know this and we had submitted ourselves
An-Naml,22,0.8442,0.061,0.539,0.401,what prevented her from accepting the true faith wa her worshipping deity other than allah for she belonged to an unbelieving people
An-Naml,62,-0.8201,0.112,0.888,0.0,she wa told enter the palace but when she saw it she thought it wa pool of water and she bared both her calf to enter into it solomon said this is slippery floor of crystal thereupon she cried out my lord have been inflicting much wrong on myself now submit myself with solomon to allah the lord of the whole universe
An-Naml,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we sent to thamud their brother salih with the message serve allah but all of sudden they became split into two quarrelling faction
An-Naml,34,0.2538,0.145,0.663,0.192,salih said my people why do you wish to hasten that evil rather than good should come upon you why should you not seek pardon from allah so that mercy be shown to you
An-Naml,31,-0.128,0.082,0.85,0.067,they said we augur ill of you and those who are with you salih replied your augury is with allah the truth is that you are people who are being tried
An-Naml,22,0.25,0.0,0.913,0.087,now there were nine ring leader in the city who created corruption in the land and never worked to set thing right
An-Naml,43,0.7002,0.025,0.847,0.127,they said swear to one another in the name of allah that we shall make sudden night swoop on salih and his family and will then tell their heir that we did not witness the destruction of his family we are indeed truthful
An-Naml,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus they planned and we too planned the while they did not know
An-Naml,21,-0.5413,0.149,0.851,0.0,so see what wa the outcome of the plan they made we utterly destroyed them and their people all of them
An-Naml,25,-0.7845,0.231,0.769,0.0,now behold their house that lie in utter ruin because of their wrong doing verily there is sign in this for the people who know
An-Naml,13,0.2235,0.0,0.864,0.136,and we delivered those who believed and were wont to avoid disobeying allah

An-Naml,23,-0.1181,0.185,0.679,0.136,but this had only one answer from his people they said expel lot folk from your city they pretend to be absolutely clean
An-Naml,23,0.4215,0.0,0.887,0.113,eventually we saved lot and his family except his wife we had decreed that she should be among those who would remain behind
An-Naml,19,-0.7579,0.277,0.723,0.0,and we rained down upon them rain it wa an evil rain for those who had already been warned

Al-Qasas,3,-0.5574,0.643,0.357,0.0,ta sin mim
Al-Qasas,8,0.3818,0.0,0.729,0.271,these are the verse of the clear book
Al-Qasas,22,0.6486,0.0,0.791,0.209,we recount to you with truth some part of the story of moses and pharaoh for the benefit of those who believe
Al-Qasas,33,-0.25,0.13,0.794,0.077,indeed pharaoh transgressed in the land and divided it people into section one group of them he humiliated and slew their son and spared their daughter truly he wa among the mischief maker
Al-Qasas,21,-0.0516,0.124,0.76,0.116,we wanted to bestow favour on those who were oppressed in the land we wanted to make them leader and heir
Al-Qasas,21,-0.1779,0.13,0.769,0.101,and to grant them power in the land and make pharaoh and haman and their host see what they had feared
Al-Qasas,42,-0.0957,0.13,0.747,0.123,we suggested to the mother of moses suckle your child but when you fear for his life cast him into the river and be not fearful nor grieve for we shall restore him to you and make him one of the messenger
Al-Qasas,33,-0.3182,0.136,0.787,0.076,then pharaoh household picked him up from the river that he may be their adversary and be cause of sorrow to them surely pharaoh and haman and their host erred in their scheming
Al-Qasas,43,0.887,0.036,0.719,0.245,the wife of pharaoh said here is delight of the eye to me and to you do not kill him maybe he will prove useful for u or we may adopt him a son they were unaware of the end of it all
Al-Qasas,33,0.4885,0.124,0.676,0.2,on the other hand the heart of moses mother wa sorely distressed had we not strengthened her heart that she might have full faith in our promise she would have disclosed the secret
Al-Qasas,18,-0.5423,0.171,0.829,0.0,she told the sister of moses follow him so she kept watch over him unperceived by the enemy
Al-Qasas,33,-0.4215,0.08,0.92,0.0,and we had already forbidden the breast of the nurse for the child so seeing the girl said shall direct you to the people of household that will rear him with utter sincerity
Al-Qasas,35,0.4672,0.065,0.721,0.215,thus did we restore moses to his mother that her eye might be comforted and she might not grieve and realise that the promise of allah wa true but most people are unaware of this
Al-Qasas,27,0.886,0.0,0.669,0.331,when moses reached the age of full youth and grew to maturity we bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge thus do we reward those who do good
Al-Qasas,78,-0.8689,0.178,0.761,0.061,once he entered the city at time when it people were heedless and he encountered two men fighting one of whom belonged to his own people and the other to his foe now the man belonging to moses own people cried out to him for help against the man from the foe and moses struck him with his fist and finished him moses said this is an act of satan surely he is an enemy who openly misleads
Al-Qasas,26,0.5542,0.095,0.671,0.234,then he prayed my lord have indeed inflicted wrong on myself so do forgive me wherefore allah forgave him for he is ever forgiving most merciful
Al-Qasas,19,0.4541,0.096,0.681,0.223,thereupon moses vowed my lord because of the favour that you have done me shall never support the guilty
Al-Qasas,50,0.128,0.112,0.75,0.138,the next morning he proceeded to the city in fear and looking around a one apprehensive of danger when all of sudden the man who had sought his help the day before again called out to him for his help moses said to him clearly you are very misguided fellow
Al-Qasas,49,-0.9581,0.33,0.6,0.069,and when moses decided to lay his violent hand on the man belonging to the enemy he cried out moses do you intend to kill me a you killed person yesterday you simply want to live in the land a tyrant and do not wish to set thing right
Al-Qasas,37,0.0516,0.091,0.791,0.119,then man came running from the farther end of the city and said moses the noble are deliberating about you that they may put you to death so do be gone am one of your well wishers
Al-Qasas,26,-0.8625,0.304,0.696,0.0,soon after hearing this moses departed in state of fear looking around a one in apprehension and prayed my lord deliver me from these unjust people
Al-Qasas,21,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,when after his departure from egypt moses headed towards midian he said hope my lord will show me the right path
Al-Qasas,60,-0.4019,0.044,0.956,0.0,when he arrived at the spring of midian he found there crowd of people watering their flock and he found apart from them two woman holding their flock back he asked the woman what is it that trouble you they said we cannot water our flock until the shepherd take their flock away and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,34,0.872,0.0,0.758,0.242,on hearing this moses watered their flock for them and then returned in shaded place and said my lord am truly in great need of any good that you might send down to me
Al-Qasas,58,0.4588,0.082,0.775,0.143,soon thereafter one of the two woman came to him walking bashfully and said my father invite you that he may reward you for your having watered our flock for u when moses came to him and narrated to him the whole of his story he said have no fear you are now safe from the iniquitous people
Al-Qasas,26,0.9022,0.0,0.674,0.326,one of the two woman said father employ this man in your service the best whom you might employ is he who is strong and trustworthy
Al-Qasas,58,-0.4092,0.048,0.933,0.019,her father said to moses want to marry one of these two daughter of mine to you if you serve me for eight year but if you complete ten year that will be of your own accord but not an obligation do not intend to treat you harshly if allah will you will find me an upright man
Al-Qasas,33,0.811,0.0,0.756,0.244,moses replied so that is agreed between me and you whichever of the two term fulfil trust that shall not be wronged allah is witness over the covenant we are committing ourselves to
Al-Qasas,50,-0.3612,0.127,0.791,0.083,when moses had fulfilled the term and wa journeying with his family he perceived fire in the direction of the mount sinai he said to his family wait here have observed fire maybe will bring to you some news or brand of fire from there that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,35,-0.8047,0.18,0.82,0.0,but when he came to the fire cry wa heard from the right bank of the valley from tree in the hallowed ground moses verily am allah the lord of all creature of the universe
Al-Qasas,45,0.6124,0.124,0.682,0.194,he received the command throw away your rod but when he saw the rod writhing a though it were serpent he turned back in retreat and did not even look behind he wa told moses go ahead and have no fear you are perfectly secure
Al-Qasas,47,0.8271,0.056,0.736,0.208,put your hand into your bosom and it will come out shining without any blemish and draw your hand close to your body to still your fear those are the two clear sign from your lord for pharaoh and his chief for truly they are disobedient people
Al-Qasas,18,-0.9246,0.453,0.547,0.0,moses said my lord have killed one person from among them and fear that they will kill me
Al-Qasas,29,-0.6249,0.253,0.606,0.14,my brother aaron is more eloquent in speech than so send him with me a helper to confirm my truthfulness for fear that they will reject me a liar
Al-Qasas,43,0.4588,0.068,0.783,0.149,he said we will certainly strengthen you through your brother and will invest both of you with such power that they shall not be able to hurt you with the help of our sign the two of you and your follower will prevail
Al-Qasas,32,0.5907,0.07,0.76,0.17,but when moses came to them with our clear sign they said this is nothing but magic that ha been contrived we never heard anything like it from our ancestor of yore
Al-Qasas,31,0.8555,0.0,0.769,0.231,moses replied my lord know best who come with guidance from him and also whose end will be the best in the hereafter a for the wrongdoer they shall not prosper
Al-Qasas,46,0.4404,0.063,0.8,0.137,pharaoh said noble do not know that you have any god beside myself haman bake brick out of clay and build lofty palace for me so that may mount up and be able to observe the god of moses even though believe that moses is liar
Al-Qasas,23,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and he and his host waxed arrogant in the land without any right believing that they will never have to return to u
Al-Qasas,23,-0.4767,0.124,0.876,0.0,eventually we seized him and his host and we flung them into the sea so do see the end of the wrong doer
Al-Qasas,24,-0.4692,0.171,0.77,0.059,and we made them leader who invite people to the fire on the day of judgement they shall not find help from any quarter
Al-Qasas,22,-0.7351,0.237,0.763,0.0,we have made curse to pursue them in this world and on the day of judgement they shall be among the despised
Al-Qasas,27,-0.1779,0.104,0.814,0.081,after we had destroyed the earlier generation we bestowed the book on moses source of enlightenment for people and guidance and mercy that they may take heed
Al-Qasas,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,muhammad you were then not on the western side when we bestowed this commandment of law and you were not among it witness
Al-Qasas,37,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereafter we raised up many generation and long time passed you were then not even present among the people of midian to rehearse our verse to them but it is we who are sending news about that
Al-Qasas,55,-0.0387,0.074,0.872,0.054,nor were you on the side of the mount sinai when we called out to moses in the first instance but it is out of mercy from your lord that you are being informed of all this so that you may warn people to whom no warner came before you maybe they will take heed
Al-Qasas,39,0.2732,0.0,0.946,0.054,we did so lest calamity might seize them because of the misdeed they committed whereafter they would say our lord why did you not send messenger to u that we follow your revelation and become among those who believe
Al-Qasas,50,0.8013,0.053,0.754,0.193,but when the truth reached them from u they said why wa he not given that which wa given to moses but did they not reject before what had been given to moses they said both are magic each supporting the other and they said we deny each of these
Al-Qasas,27,0.7096,0.0,0.809,0.191,tell them prophet then do bring book from allah which is better guide than either of them and will follow it do so if you are truthful
Al-Qasas,42,-0.4215,0.149,0.736,0.114,but if they do not hearken to this know well that they only follow their lust and who is in greater error than he who follows his lust without any guidance from allah allah doe not guide those given to wrong doing
Al-Qasas,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we have constantly conveyed them the word of admonition that they may take heed
Al-Qasas,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those on whom we bestowed the book before do believe in this to wit the qur an
Al-Qasas,25,0.3182,0.0,0.913,0.087,when it is recited to them they say we believe in it for it is the truth from our lord indeed we were already muslim
Al-Qasas,28,0.6369,0.116,0.605,0.279,these will be granted their reward twice over because they remained steadfast they repel evil with good and spend in alms out of the sustenance we provided them
Al-Qasas,35,-0.0408,0.166,0.695,0.139,and when they hear any vain talk they turn away from it saying we have our deed and you have your deed peace be to you we do not desire to act like the ignorant
Al-Qasas,26,0.6586,0.067,0.728,0.206,prophet you cannot grant guidance to whom you please it is allah who guide those whom he will he know best who are amenable to guidance
Al-Qasas,46,0.4404,0.0,0.915,0.085,they say if we were to follow this guidance with you we should be snatched away from our land have we not established for them secure sanctuary to which fruit of all kind are brought a provision from u but most of them do not know
Al-Qasas,33,-0.5267,0.098,0.871,0.031,and how many town did we destroy whose inhabitant exulted on account of their affluence these are their dwelling in which very few dwelt after them eventually it is we who inherited them
Al-Qasas,32,0.6908,0.0,0.84,0.16,your lord would not destroy town until he had sent to it centre messenger who would recite to them our verse nor would we destroy any town unless it inhabitant were iniquitous
Al-Qasas,33,0.1606,0.085,0.814,0.101,whatever you have been given is provision for the life of this world and it glitter but that which is with allah is better and more enduring do you not use your intellect
Al-Qasas,42,0.0258,0.088,0.76,0.152,now he to whom we have promised good which he is going to obtain can he be like him whom we have given the good thing of this life but who will be brought up for punishment on the day of judgement
Al-Qasas,25,0.1695,0.0,0.935,0.065,let them not forget that the day when allah will call unto them and say where are those whom you imagined to be my associate
Al-Qasas,40,-0.4936,0.127,0.822,0.052,those against whom the word will be realised will say our lord these are the one whom we led astray just a we ourselves strayed we absolve ourselves before you of all blame it wa not u that they worshipped
Al-Qasas,44,0.2144,0.0,0.959,0.041,they will then be told call upon those for help whom you declared to be our associate they will then call upon them but they will not answer them they will have observed the chastisement in front of them would that they were guided
Al-Qasas,24,0.2057,0.0,0.927,0.073,let them not disregard that the day when allah will call out to them saying what wa the answer you gave to the messenger
Al-Qasas,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they will not be able to think of any reply nor will they be able to ask one another
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but those who repented and believed and acted righteously they will perhaps be among those who will prosper there
Al-Qasas,38,0.8519,0.0,0.79,0.21,your lord creates what he will and chooses for his task whomsoever he will it is not for them to make the choice glory be to allah he is exalted far above their associating others in his divinity
Al-Qasas,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,your lord know all that their heart conceal and all that they reveal
Al-Qasas,33,0.705,0.042,0.788,0.17,he is allah there is no god but he his is the praise in this world and in the hereafter his is the command and to him will all of you be returned
Al-Qasas,38,0.2732,0.0,0.946,0.054,prophet tell them did you consider if allah were to make the night perpetual over you till the day of judgement is there god other than allah who can bring forth light for you do you not hear
Al-Qasas,43,0.2732,0.0,0.952,0.048,say did you consider if allah were to make the day become perpetual over you till the day of judgement is there god other than allah who can bring in night for you that you may repose in it will you not see
Al-Qasas,34,0.7845,0.0,0.797,0.203,it is out of his mercy that he ha made for you night and day that you may repose during the night and seek his bounty during the day that you might be grateful
Al-Qasas,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,let them bear in mind that on that day when he will call out to them saying where are my associate those whom you imagined to be so
Al-Qasas,39,0.0772,0.048,0.896,0.056,and from each people we shall draw witness and shall say to them do produce your evidence now then they shall know that the truth is with allah alone and the lie which they had invented will forsake them
Al-Qasas,59,0.684,0.082,0.755,0.162,to be sure qarun korah wa one of moses people then he transgressed against them we had bestowed on him such treasure that their very key would have been raised with difficulty by whole group of strong people once when his people said to him do not exult for allah doe not love those who exult in their rich
Al-Qasas,52,0.8061,0.207,0.503,0.29,seek by mean of the wealth that allah ha granted you the abode of the hereafter but forget not your share in this world and do good a allah ha been good to you and do not strive to create mischief in the land for allah love not those who create mischief
Al-Qasas,50,-0.5789,0.165,0.714,0.121,he replied all this ha been given to me on account of certain knowledge that have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him those who were stronger in might than he and were more numerous in multitude the wicked are not asked about their act of sin
Al-Qasas,33,0.9231,0.0,0.662,0.338,once korah went forth among his people in full glitter those seeking the life of this world said would that we had the like of what korah ha he truly ha great fortune
Al-Qasas,34,0.9161,0.077,0.622,0.302,but those endowed with true knowledge said woe to you the reward of allah is best for those who believe and act righteously but none except those who are patient shall attain to this
Al-Qasas,37,-0.296,0.058,0.942,0.0,at last we caused the earth to swallow him and his house thereafter there wa no group of people that could come to his aid against allah nor wa he able to come to his own aid
Al-Qasas,71,0.4404,0.071,0.833,0.096,and those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow ala we had forgotten that it is allah who increase the provision of those of his servant whom he will and grant in sparing measure to those whom he will but for allah favour upon u he could have made u to be swallowed too ala we had forgotten that the unbeliever do not prosper
Al-Qasas,34,-0.4537,0.236,0.62,0.145,a for the abode of the hereafter we shall assign it exclusively for those who do not seek glory on earth nor want to cause mischief the god fearing shall have the best end
Al-Qasas,27,-0.4767,0.174,0.655,0.171,he who shall bring good deed shall be rewarded with what is better but those who bring evil deed shall not be requited more than their deed
Al-Qasas,36,0.9571,0.052,0.536,0.412,prophet surely he who ha ordained the qur an on you will bring you to the best end say to them my lord know best who ha brought true guidance and who is in clear error
Al-Qasas,37,0.0624,0.057,0.88,0.063,prophet you never looked forward for the book to be revealed to you it is out of sheer mercy of your lord that it wa revealed to you so do not lend any support to the unbeliever
Al-Qasas,36,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and let it never happen that the unbeliever might turn you away from the revelation of allah after they have been revealed to you call people to your lord and never become one of the unbeliever
Al-Qasas,32,-0.343,0.132,0.868,0.0,and do not invoke any god beside allah there is no god but he all will perish but he to him belongs the command and to him shall all of you return

Al-Ankabut,52,0.6428,0.048,0.833,0.12,we have enjoined upon man kindness to his parent but if they exert pressure on you to associate with me in my divinity any that you do not know to be my associate do not obey them to me is your return and shall let you know all that you have done
Al-Ankabut,16,0.4939,0.0,0.756,0.244,a for those who believed and acted righteously we shall certainly admit them among the righteous
Al-Ankabut,72,-0.6124,0.103,0.844,0.053,among people there are some who say we believe in allah but when such person is made to endure suffering in allah cause he reckons the persecution he suffers at the hand of people a though it is chastisement from allah but if victory come from your lord the same person will say we were with you doe allah not know whatever is in the heart of the people of the world
Al-Ankabut,13,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,allah will surely ascertain who are the believer and who are the hypocrite

Az-Zukhruf,20,-0.2484,0.146,0.75,0.104,we utterly destroyed them although they were greater in might than these the example of ancient people have gone before
Az-Zukhruf,27,0.8779,0.0,0.645,0.355,yet if you were to ask them who created the heaven and the earth they will certainly say the all mighty the all knowing ha created them

Az-Zukhruf,36,-0.5859,0.151,0.789,0.06,they believe so although when any of them is given tidings of the birth of female child the like of which he assigns to the merciful one his countenance darkens and he is choked with grief
Az-Zukhruf,21,-0.2057,0.083,0.917,0.0,do they assign to allah one who grows up amidst ornament and is not well versed in the art of disputation
Az-Zukhruf,31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they claim that angel who are allah chosen servant are female did they witness how their body is constituted their testimony shall be written and they shall be called to account
Az-Zukhruf,27,-0.5645,0.16,0.801,0.038,they say had the merciful one so willed we would never have worshipped these deity but they have no knowledge of the matter and are simply conjecturing
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.3612,0.0,0.821,0.179,or did we bestow upon them book before on whose authority they are holding on to angel worship
Az-Zukhruf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nay they simply claim we found our forefather on way and we continue to find guidance in their footstep
Az-Zukhruf,29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and thus it is whenever we sent any warner to city it affluent one said we found our forefather on way and we continue to follow in their footstep
Az-Zukhruf,36,0.1779,0.056,0.87,0.074,each prophet asked them will you do so even if we were to show you way better than the way of your forefather they answered we disbelieve in the religion with which you have been sent

Az-Zukhruf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,call to mind when abraham said to his father and his people totally disown all whom you serve

Az-Zukhruf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and abraham left behind this word to endure among his posterity so that they may return to it
Az-Zukhruf,37,0.8491,0.0,0.763,0.237,even when they began worshipping others than allah we did not destroy them but bestowed sustenance on them and on their forefather until there came to them the truth and messenger who clearly expounded thing to them
Az-Zukhruf,17,-0.1027,0.135,0.75,0.115,and when the truth came to them they said this is just sorcery and we reject it
Az-Zukhruf,19,0.6249,0.0,0.814,0.186,they say why wa this qur an not sent down upon some great man from the two main city
Az-Zukhruf,56,0.872,0.0,0.811,0.189,is it they who distribute the mercy of your lord it is we who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world and have raised some above others in rank that some of them may harness others to their service your lord mercy is better than all the treasure that they hoard
Az-Zukhruf,41,-0.296,0.052,0.948,0.0,were it not that all mankind would become single community and follow the same way we would have provided for all those who disbelieve in the merciful one silver roof for their house and silver stair on which to go up

Az-Zukhruf,35,0.5499,0.111,0.657,0.232,or that they be made of gold surely all this is only the enjoyment of the life of the world but true prosperity in the hereafter with your lord is only for the god fearing

Az-Zukhruf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we shall inflict retribution on them whether we take you away from the world before we do that
Az-Zukhruf,18,0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,or make you see the end that we had promised them for we have full power over them
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.7351,0.0,0.66,0.34,so hold fast to what ha been revealed to you surely you are on the straight way
Az-Zukhruf,22,0.6249,0.0,0.837,0.163,verily it is great source of eminence for you and your people and soon you will be called to account concerning that
Az-Zukhruf,22,0.5719,0.0,0.85,0.15,ask all our messenger whom we sent before you whether we had appointed any deity beside the merciful one to be worshipped
Az-Zukhruf,23,0.4588,0.0,0.88,0.12,indeed we sent moses with our sign to pharaoh and his noble he told them am messenger of the lord of the universe
Az-Zukhruf,15,0.7003,0.0,0.674,0.326,yet when he brought forth clear sign from u then lo they burst into laughter
Az-Zukhruf,28,0.3612,0.0,0.915,0.085,every sign that we showed them wa greater than it predecessor and then we seized them with our chastisement so that they may return to the right way
Az-Zukhruf,30,0.5719,0.0,0.852,0.148,whenever they faced an affliction they would say magician pray for u to your lord according to your station with him we shall certainly be guided to the right way
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but lo each time we removed our affliction from them they would go back on their word
Az-Zukhruf,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and pharaoh proclaimed among his people my people do not have dominion over egypt and are these stream not flowing beneath me can you see

Az-Zukhruf,16,0.4404,0.0,0.838,0.162,he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him surely they were an iniquitous people
Az-Zukhruf,15,-0.5994,0.218,0.782,0.0,so when they incurred our wrath we exacted retribution from them and drowned them all
Az-Zukhruf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and made them thing of the past and an example for those who would come after them
Az-Zukhruf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,no sooner the example of the son of mary wa mentioned than lo and behold your people raised clamour
Az-Zukhruf,20,0.4404,0.0,0.868,0.132,and said who is better our deity or he they said so only out of contentiousness they are disputatious people
Az-Zukhruf,30,0.1779,0.066,0.846,0.088,he wa no more than servant of ours one upon whom we bestowed our favour and whom we made an example of our infinite power for the child of israel
Az-Zukhruf,20,0.2263,0.0,0.909,0.091,if we had so willed we could have made some of you into angel to become your successor on earth
Az-Zukhruf,23,-0.4703,0.185,0.744,0.071,verily he jesus is portent of the hour so be in no doubt concerning it and follow me this is the straight way
Az-Zukhruf,17,-0.1531,0.164,0.701,0.136,let not satan hinder you from believing in the hour for surely he is your open enemy
Az-Zukhruf,32,0.2225,0.105,0.741,0.153,when jesus came with clear sign and said have brought wisdom to you that may make plain to you some of the thing you differ about so fear allah and follow me

Al-Jaathiyah,53,0.5859,0.0,0.912,0.088,did you ever consider the case of him who took his desire a his god and then allah caused him to go astray despite knowledge and sealed his hearing and his heart and cast veil over his sight who after allah can direct him to the right way will you not take heed
Al-Jaathiyah,43,-0.8658,0.199,0.801,0.0,they say there is no life other than our present worldly life herein we live and we die and it is only the passage of time that destroys u yet the fact is that they know nothing about this and are only conjecturing

Al-Jaathiyah,48,0.3582,0.115,0.743,0.142,and when it wa said to them surely allah promise is true and there is no doubt regarding the hour of resurrection you were wont to say we do not know what the hour of resurrection is we are simply making conjecture and are not at all certain
Al-Jaathiyah,22,-0.7717,0.251,0.749,0.0,on that day the evil of their deed will become apparent to them and what they had mocked at will encompass them
Al-Jaathiyah,37,-0.5106,0.112,0.888,0.0,and it will be said we will forget you today a you forgot the meeting of this day of yours the fire shall now be your abode and you shall have none to come to your aid

Al-Ahqaaf,35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,tell them am not the first of the messenger and do not know what shall be done with me or with you follow only what is revealed to me and am nothing but plain warner
Al-Ahqaaf,60,-0.1702,0.095,0.806,0.099,tell them prophet did you consider what would be your end if this qur an were indeed from allah and yet you rejected it and this even though witness from the child of israel ha testified to the like of it but he believed while you waxed arrogant verily allah doe not guide such wrong doer to the right way
Al-Ahqaaf,41,0.7728,0.0,0.805,0.195,the unbeliever say to the believer if there wa any good in this book others would not have beaten u to it acceptance but since they have not been guided to it they will certainly say this is an old fabrication
Al-Ahqaaf,38,0.5859,0.1,0.714,0.185,yet before this the book wa revealed to moses a guide and mercy this book which confirms it is in the arabic tongue to warn the wrong doer and to give good tidings to those who do good
Al-Ahqaaf,20,0.8277,0.0,0.622,0.378,surely those who said our lord is allah and then remained steadfast shall have nothing to fear nor to grieve
Al-Ahqaaf,17,0.836,0.0,0.639,0.361,they are the people of paradise they shall remain in it forever a reward for their deed
Al-Ahqaaf,106,0.5423,0.056,0.841,0.103,we have enjoined man to be kind to his parent in pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give birth to him the carrying of the child to his weaning is period of thirty month and when he is grown to full maturity and reach the age of forty he prays my lord dispose me that may give thanks for the bounty that you have bestowed upon me and my parent and dispose me that may do righteous deed that would please you and also make my descendant righteous repent to you and am one of those who surrender themselves to you
Al-Ahqaaf,33,0.8934,0.093,0.568,0.339,such are those from whom we accept their best deed and whose evil deed we overlook they will be among the people of paradise in consonance with the true promise made to them
Al-Ahqaaf,64,0.7964,0.09,0.731,0.179,but he who say to his parent fie on you do you threaten me that shall be resurrected although myriad generation have passed away before me and not one of them wa resurrected the parent beseech allah and say to their child woe to you have faith surely allah promise is true but he say all this is nothing but fable of olden time
Al-Ahqaaf,33,-0.1531,0.14,0.711,0.15,it is against such that allah sentence of punishment ha become due they will join the community of human and jinni that have preceded them verily all of them will court utter loss
Al-Ahqaaf,24,0.3412,0.0,0.905,0.095,of these all have rank according to their deed so that allah may fully recompense them for their deed they shall not be wronged
Al-Ahqaaf,59,-0.816,0.198,0.722,0.08,and on the day when the unbeliever will be exposed to the fire they will be told you have exhausted your share of the bounty in the life of the world and you took your fill of enjoyment so degrading chastisement shall be yours on this day for you waxed arrogant in the earth without justification and acted iniquitously
Al-Ahqaaf,52,0.2023,0.097,0.81,0.093,recount to them the story of hud the brother of the tribe of ad hud warned his people beside the sand dune and there have been other warner before him and since his time saying serve none but allah verily fear that the chastisement of an awesome day shall come upon you
Al-Ahqaaf,31,0.3612,0.082,0.757,0.161,they said have you come to u to turn u away from our god then bring upon u the scourge that you threaten u with do so if you are truthful
Al-Ahqaaf,26,-0.4854,0.147,0.853,0.0,he replied allah alone know about this only convey to you the message that have been sent with but see that you are an ignorant people
Al-Ahqaaf,37,-0.6369,0.133,0.867,0.0,when they saw the scourge advancing towards their valley they said this is cloud that will bring much rain to u by no mean it is what you had sought to hasten wind storm bearing grievous chastisement
Al-Ahqaaf,27,-0.7579,0.208,0.757,0.035,that will destroy everything by the command of it lord thereafter nothing wa left to be seen except their dwelling thus do we requite the wrong doer
Al-Ahqaaf,49,-0.7783,0.126,0.874,0.0,we had established them firmly in manner we have not established you we had given them ear and eye and heart but nothing availed them neither their ear nor their eye nor their heart for they denied the sign of allah then what they had mocked at encompassed them
Al-Ahqaaf,29,-0.6908,0.208,0.712,0.079,surely we destroyed many town around you we sent our message to them repeatedly and in diverse form that they may eschew their evil way and return to allah
Al-Ahqaaf,49,0.1531,0.062,0.846,0.092,so why did those whom they had set up a god apart from allah hoping that they would bring them nearer to him not come to their aid instead they failed them this wa the end of the lie they had fabricated and the false belief they had invented
Al-Ahqaaf,55,0.4767,0.0,0.927,0.073,and call to mind when we sent to you party of the jinni that they may listen to the qur an when they reached the place where you were reciting the qur an they said to one another be silent and listen and when the recitation ended they went back to their people a warner
Al-Ahqaaf,27,0.4939,0.0,0.856,0.144,they said our people we have heard scripture revealed after moses verifying the scripture revealed before it it guide to the truth and to the straight way
Al-Ahqaaf,29,-0.4404,0.182,0.689,0.129,our people respond to the call of him who call you to allah and believe in him allah will forgive your sin and will protect you from grievous chastisement
Al-Ahqaaf,38,-0.4767,0.132,0.808,0.06,and he who doe not respond to the one who call to allah will not be able to frustrate him on earth nor will they have anyone to protect them from allah such people are in manifest error
Al-Ahqaaf,40,0.6077,0.123,0.639,0.238,do they not see that allah who created the heaven and the earth and creating them did not wear him out ha the power to bring the dead back to life why not he certainly ha the power over everything
Al-Ahqaaf,47,-0.7289,0.184,0.766,0.05,on the day when the unbeliever will be brought within sight of the fire they will be asked is this not the truth and they will answer yes by our lord this is the truth allah will say then suffer the chastisement a requital for your disbelieving
Al-Ahqaaf,70,-0.3612,0.125,0.781,0.093,so bear with patience prophet even a the messenger endowed with firmness of resolve before you bore with patience and do not be hasty in their regard the day when they see what they had been warned against they will feel a though they had remained in the world no more than an hour of day the truth ha been conveyed will any then suffer perdition except those who disobey
Muhammad,21,-0.3818,0.197,0.709,0.094,allah ha caused the work of those who disbelieve and hinder people from the way of allah to go to waste
Muhammad,39,0.5423,0.093,0.698,0.209,a for those who attained to faith and did righteous work and believed in what wa revealed to muhammad which indeed is the truth from their lord allah ha remitted their evil deed and ha set their condition right
Muhammad,34,0.6249,0.0,0.863,0.137,that is because those who disbelieved followed falsehood whereas those who believed followed the truth that came to them from their lord thus doe allah set forth to people parable showing their true state
Muhammad,97,-0.6428,0.094,0.852,0.054,when you meet the unbeliever in battle smite their neck until you have crushed them then bind your captive firmly thereafter you are entitled to set them free either by an act of grace or against ransom until the war end that is for you to do if allah had so willed he would have himself exacted retribution from them but he did not do so that he may test some of you by mean of others a for those who are slain in the way of allah he shall never let their work go to waste
Muhammad,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he will guide them and set their condition right
Muhammad,12,0.8126,0.0,0.517,0.483,and will admit them to paradise with which he ha acquainted them
Muhammad,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,believer if you aid allah he will come to your aid and will plant your foot firmly
Muhammad,19,0.0516,0.107,0.777,0.117,a to those who disbelieve perdition lie in store for them and allah ha reduced their work to nought
Muhammad,19,-0.4215,0.135,0.865,0.0,that wa because they were averse to what allah had revealed so he let their work go to waste
Muhammad,29,-0.8268,0.222,0.778,0.0,have they not journeyed through the land to see the end of those who went before them allah utterly destroyed them these unbeliever are doomed to the same end
Muhammad,18,-0.2924,0.114,0.886,0.0,that is because allah is the protector of the believer whereas the unbeliever have none to protect them
Muhammad,40,0.743,0.053,0.754,0.193,allah shall admit those who believe and do righteous work to the garden beneath which river flow a for the unbeliever they enjoy the pleasure of this transient life and eat a cattle eat the fire shall be their resort
Muhammad,27,-0.4374,0.169,0.753,0.078,prophet how many are the city that had greater power than your city that drove you out we destroyed them and there wa none to protect them
Muhammad,27,-0.0772,0.131,0.716,0.152,then can he who is on clear guidance from his lord be like him whose evil deed have been embellished to him and who pursued their lust
Muhammad,82,0.9062,0.063,0.736,0.201,here is the parable of paradise which the god fearing have been promised in it shall be river of incorruptible water river of milk unchanging in taste and river of wine delight to those that drink and river of pure honey in it they will have every kind of fruit a well a forgiveness from their lord can such be like those who will abide in the fire and will be given boiling water to drink that will tear their bowel apart
Muhammad,43,0.0,0.087,0.847,0.066,among them some give ear to you but no sooner do they leave your presence than they ask those endowed with knowledge what is it that he said just now such are those whose heart allah ha sealed and who pursue their lust
Muhammad,23,-0.0772,0.137,0.701,0.162,a for those who were led to the guidance allah increase them in their guidance and cause them to grow in god fearing
Muhammad,42,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,are they waiting then for anything else than the last hour to suddenly come upon them already some of it token have come but when it doe actually come upon them where will any time be left for them to take heed
Muhammad,39,0.5187,0.038,0.823,0.14,know therefore prophet that there is no god but allah and ask forgiveness for your shortcoming and also for the shortcoming of believing men and believing woman allah know the place where you move about and where you dwell
Muhammad,52,-0.9209,0.219,0.781,0.0,the believer used to say why is surah that would ordain fighting not revealed but when definitive surah wa revealed wherein fighting wa mentioned you saw that those in whose heart there wa sickness looked at you a though they were about to faint at the approach of death pity on them
Muhammad,31,0.9446,0.0,0.617,0.383,they keep affirming their obedience and saying good word but when course of action wa clearly determined it would have been better for them if they had proved true to allah
Muhammad,27,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,now if you were to turn away what else can be expected but that you will work corruption in the land and fly at each other throat
Muhammad,21,-0.6369,0.244,0.667,0.089,it is these upon whom allah ha laid his curse so he made them deaf and deprived them of their sight
Muhammad,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they then not reflect on the qur an or are there lock on their heart
Muhammad,32,0.8979,0.0,0.677,0.323,certainly those who have turned their back on the true guidance after it became manifest to them satan ha embellished their way for them and ha buoyed them up with false hope
Muhammad,31,0.743,0.039,0.72,0.241,this because they said to those who are averse to the faith that allah ha revealed in some matter we shall obey you allah ha full knowledge of their secret parley
Muhammad,22,-0.7469,0.203,0.797,0.0,but how will they fare when angel will take their soul at death and will carry them striking their face and back
Muhammad,26,0.5106,0.1,0.699,0.201,that is because they have followed way that angered allah and have been averse to his good pleasure so he reduced all their work to nought
Muhammad,19,0.4023,0.0,0.869,0.131,or do they in whose heart there is sickness believe that allah will not bring their failing to light
Muhammad,39,0.34,0.0,0.941,0.059,if we were to so will we could have shown them to you so that you would recognise them by their face and you would certainly know them by the manner of their speech allah know all your deed
Muhammad,22,0.743,0.0,0.722,0.278,we shall certainly test you until we know those of you who truly strive and remain steadfast and will ascertain about you
Muhammad,42,0.6858,0.0,0.876,0.124,those who disbelieved and barred others from allah way and opposed the messenger after the true guidance had become manifest to them they shall not be able to cause allah the least harm rather allah will reduce all their work to nought

An-Najm,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this is nothing but revelation that is conveyed to him
An-Najm,9,0.6962,0.0,0.549,0.451,something that very powerful one ha imparted to him
An-Najm,11,0.6597,0.0,0.625,0.375,one endowed with immense wisdom he came forth and stood poised
An-Najm,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,being on the higher horizon
An-Najm,8,-0.4767,0.307,0.693,0.0,then he drew near and hung above suspended
An-Najm,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,until he wa two bow length away or nearer
An-Najm,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he revealed to allah servant whatever he had to reveal
An-Najm,9,-0.296,0.216,0.784,0.0,his heart added no untruth to what he saw
An-Najm,15,0.0516,0.0,0.921,0.079,are you then going to contend with him regarding what he see with his eye
An-Najm,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,indeed he saw him second time

An-Najm,22,0.0258,0.09,0.816,0.094,although they have no knowledge regarding that they only follow their conjecture and conjecture can never take the place of the truth
An-Najm,22,-0.2229,0.132,0.868,0.0,so leave alone those who turn away from the remembrance of u and who seek nothing but the life of the world

An-Najm,9,-0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,so which of your lord bounty will you doubt
An-Najm,8,-0.5859,0.444,0.556,0.0,this is warning among the warning of yore

Al-Qamar,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,regardless of any sign these people see they turn away and say this is an ongoing sorcery
Al-Qamar,25,0.4215,0.0,0.858,0.142,they also gave the lie to the splitting asunder of the moon and only followed their desire yet everything is destined to reach an end
Al-Qamar,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146,surely there came to them narrative of the ancient nation that should suffice to deter them from transgression
Al-Qamar,13,-0.2263,0.19,0.675,0.135,narrative that are full of consummate wisdom but warning do not avail them
Al-Qamar,18,-0.5256,0.166,0.834,0.0,so turn away from them prophet on the day when caller shall call them to thing most terrible

Al-Qamar,23,-0.7003,0.216,0.784,0.0,they shall be hurrying forth towards the caller and the unbeliever who had once denied this day will say this is woeful day

Al-Qamar,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thereupon we opened the gate of the sky for water to pour down
Al-Qamar,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we made the earth burst forth with spring and all this water converged to fulfil that which had been decreed
Al-Qamar,12,-0.25,0.154,0.846,0.0,and we bore noah on the vessel built of plank and nail
