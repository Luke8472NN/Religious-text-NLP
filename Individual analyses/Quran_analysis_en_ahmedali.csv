Al-Baqarah,17,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,remember we gave moses the book and discernment of falsehood and truth that you may be guided
Al-Baqarah,45,-0.25,0.145,0.709,0.145,remember moses said my people by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm so now turn to your creator in repentance and kill your pride which is better with your lord and the lord softened towards you for he is all forgiving and merciful
Al-Baqarah,25,0.0258,0.077,0.843,0.08,remember when you said to moses we shall not believe in you until we see god face to face lightning struck you a you looked

Al-Baqarah,55,0.4215,0.101,0.77,0.129,and remember when moses asked for water for his people we told him to strike the rock with his staff and behold twelve spring of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribe came to know it place of drinking eat and drink enjoy god gift and spread no discord in the land
Al-Baqarah,87,-0.8505,0.153,0.776,0.071,remember when you said moses we are tired of eating the same food day after day ask your lord to give u fruit of the earth herb and cucumber grain and lentil and onion he said would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad go then to the city you shall have what you ask so they were disgraced and became indigent earning the anger of god for they disbelieved the word of god and slayed the prophet unjustly for they transgressed and rebelled

Al-Baqarah,31,0.3818,0.158,0.642,0.201,remember when moses said to his people god demand that you sacrifice cow they said are you making fun of u and he said god forbid that be of the ignorant
Al-Baqarah,37,0.2006,0.04,0.899,0.062,call on your lord for u they said that he might inform u what kind she should be neither old nor young say god but of age in between answered moses so do a you are bid

Al-Baqarah,19,-0.7579,0.296,0.623,0.082,remember when you killed man and blamed each other for the deed god brought to light what you concealed
Al-Baqarah,25,-0.8126,0.261,0.675,0.064,we had pronounced already slay the murderer for taking life thus god preserve life from death and show you his sign that you may understand
Al-Baqarah,56,0.296,0.101,0.748,0.151,yet in spite of this your heart only hardened like rock or even harder but among rock are those from which river flow and there are also those which split open and water gush forth a well a those that roll down for fear of god and god is not negligent of all that you do
Al-Baqarah,29,0.1027,0.102,0.756,0.142,how do you expect them to put their faith in you when you know that some among them heard the word of god and having understood perverted it knowingly
Al-Baqarah,44,-0.3182,0.124,0.778,0.098,for when they meet the faithful they say we believe but when among themselves they say why do you tell them what the lord ha revealed to you they will only dispute it in the presence of your lord have you no sense indeed
Al-Baqarah,16,-0.3641,0.201,0.799,0.0,do they not know that god is aware of what they hide and what they disclose
Al-Baqarah,23,0.1531,0.107,0.764,0.129,among them are heathen who know nothing of the book but only what they wish to believe and are only lost in fantasy
Al-Baqarah,40,-0.9313,0.329,0.56,0.11,but woe to them who fake the scripture and say this is from god so that they might earn some profit thereby and woe to them for what they fake and woe to them for what they earn from it
Al-Baqarah,45,0.7334,0.086,0.693,0.221,yet they say the fire will not touch u for more than few day say have you so received promise from god then surely god will not withdraw his pledge or do you impute thing to god of which you have no knowledge at all
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.8979,0.342,0.658,0.0,why they who have earned the wage of sin and are enclosed in error are people of hell where they will abide for ever
Al-Baqarah,17,0.8922,0.0,0.609,0.391,but those who believe and do good deed are people of paradise and shall live there forever
Al-Baqarah,69,0.9382,0.085,0.667,0.249,remember when we made covenant with the people of israel and said worship no one but god and be good to your parent and your kin and to orphan and the needy and speak of goodness to men observe your devotional obligation and give zakat the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others you went back on your word except only few and paid no heed
Al-Baqarah,34,0.5574,0.0,0.874,0.126,and remember when we made covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their home you promised and are witness to it too
Al-Baqarah,91,-0.9779,0.265,0.673,0.062,but you still kill one another and you turn section of your people from their home assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression yet when they are brought to you a captive you ransom them although forbidden it wa to drive them away do you then believe part of the book and reject part there is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world and on the day of judgement the severest of punishment for god is not heedless of all that you do
Al-Baqarah,28,-0.3252,0.114,0.886,0.0,they are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them
Al-Baqarah,56,0.8834,0.0,0.821,0.179,remember we gave moses the book and sent after him many an apostle and to jesus son of mary we gave clear evidence of the truth reinforcing him with divine grace even so when messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty and called some imposter and some others you slew
Al-Baqarah,24,0.5423,0.0,0.83,0.17,and they say our heart are enfolded in cover in fact god ha cursed them for their unbelief and only little do they believe
Al-Baqarah,54,-0.1027,0.096,0.798,0.106,and when the book wa sent to them by god verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbeliever and even though they recognised it when it came to them they renounced it the curse of god be on those who deny
Al-Baqarah,38,-0.7003,0.237,0.622,0.141,they bartered their life ill denying the revelation of god out of spite that god should bestow his grace among his votary on whomsoever he will and thus earned wrath upon wrath the punishment for disbeliever is ignominious
Al-Baqarah,55,0.8519,0.0,0.809,0.191,and when it is said to them believe in what god ha sent down they say we believe what wa sent to u and do not believe what ha come thereafter although it affirms the truth they posse already say why have you then been slaying god apostle a of old if you do believe
Al-Baqarah,21,0.3182,0.0,0.897,0.103,although moses had come to you with evidence of the truth you chose the calf in his absence and you transgressed
Al-Baqarah,59,-0.6705,0.088,0.912,0.0,remember when we took your pledge and exalted you on the mount saying hold fast to what we have given you firmly and pay heed you said we have heard and will not obey the image of the calf had sunk deep into their heart on account of unbelief say vile is your belief if you are believer indeed
Al-Baqarah,37,-0.128,0.173,0.664,0.163,tell them if you think you alone will abide with god to the exclusion of the rest of mankind in the mansion of the world to come then wish for death if what you say is true
Al-Baqarah,23,0.8881,0.084,0.525,0.39,but they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past and god know the sinner well
Al-Baqarah,42,-0.2565,0.12,0.781,0.099,you will see they are covetous of life more than other men even more than those who practise idolatry each one of them desire to live thousand year although longevity will never save them from punishment for god see all they do
Al-Baqarah,36,0.3818,0.082,0.751,0.167,say whosoever is the enemy of gabriel who revealed the word of god to you by the dispensation of god reaffirming what had been revealed before and is guidance and good news for those who believe
Al-Baqarah,24,-0.5859,0.224,0.641,0.135,whosoever is the enemy of god and his angel and apostle and of gabriel and michael then god is the enemy of such unbeliever

Al-Baqarah,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and every time they made pledge some of them pushed it aside and many of them do not believe
Al-Baqarah,32,-0.0258,0.066,0.871,0.063,when messenger wa sent to them by god affirming the book they had already received some of them put his message behind their back a if they had no knowledge of it
Al-Baqarah,126,-0.953,0.194,0.724,0.082,and they follow what devilish being used to chant against the authority of solomon though solomon never disbelieved and only the devil denied who taught sorcery to men which they said had been revealed to the angel of babylon harut and marut who however never taught it without saying we have been sent to deceive you so do not renounce your faith they learnt what led to discord between husband and wife yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of god and they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain they knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come and that surely they had sold themselves for something that wa vile if only they had sense
Al-Baqarah,26,0.891,0.0,0.655,0.345,had they come to believe instead and taken heed for themselves they would surely have earned from god far better reward if only they had sense
Al-Baqarah,30,-0.5927,0.125,0.875,0.0,say not to the prophet believer have regard for u ra ina but look at u unzurna and obey him in what he say painful is the nemesis for disbeliever
Al-Baqarah,42,0.8706,0.095,0.643,0.262,those without faith among the people of the book and those who worship idol do not wish that good should come to you from your lord but god chooses whom he like for his grace and the bounty of god is infinite
Al-Baqarah,34,0.3582,0.098,0.767,0.136,when we cancel message sent to an earlier prophet or throw it into oblivion we replace it with one better or one similar do you not know that god ha power over all thing

Al-Baqarah,30,0.2144,0.0,0.938,0.062,do you too believer wish to question your apostle a moses wa in the past but he who take unbelief in exchange for belief only stray from the right path
Al-Baqarah,52,0.91,0.025,0.698,0.277,how many of the follower of the book having once known the truth desire in their heart out of envy to turn you into infidel again even after the truth ha become clear to them but you forbear and overlook till god fulfil his plan and god ha power over all thing
Al-Baqarah,28,0.4588,0.122,0.669,0.209,fulfil your devotional obligation and pay the zakat and what you send ahead of good you will find with god for he see all that you do ill
Al-Baqarah,28,0.765,0.0,0.798,0.202,and they say none will go to paradise but the jew and the christian but this is only wishful thinking say bring the proof if you are truthful
Al-Baqarah,28,0.128,0.211,0.566,0.224,only he who surrender to god with all his heart and also doe good will find his reward with his lord and will have no fear or regret

Al-Baqarah,50,-0.796,0.193,0.732,0.075,and who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of god being used in his mosque who hurry to despoil them even though he ha no right to enter them except in reverence for them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come
Al-Baqarah,24,0.7717,0.0,0.732,0.268,to god belong the east and the west wherever you turn the glory of god is everywhere all pervading is he and all knowing

Al-Baqarah,47,-0.5859,0.165,0.737,0.098,and when abraham said lord make this city of peace and give those of it citizen who believe in god and the last day fruit for food he answered to those will also give little who believe not for time then drag them to hell dreadful destination

Al-Anam,24,0.5106,0.0,0.875,0.125,thus we showed to abraham the visible and invisible world of the heaven and the earth that he could be among those who believe
Al-Anam,33,0.743,0.039,0.809,0.151,when the night came with her covering of darkness he saw star and azar his father said this is my lord but when the star set abraham said love not those that wane

Al-Anam,20,0.3612,0.085,0.766,0.149,they alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial and are guided on the right path
Al-Anam,27,0.4404,0.078,0.752,0.169,this is the argument we gave to abraham against his people we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degree your lord is wise and all knowing
Al-Anam,42,0.765,0.0,0.855,0.145,and we gave him isaac and jacob and guided them a we had guided noah before them and of his descendant david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron thus we reward those who are upright and do good

Al-Anam,32,-0.2491,0.098,0.831,0.071,those were the people to whom we gave the book and the law and the prophethood but if they reject these thing we shall entrust them to people who will not deny
Al-Anam,32,-0.0129,0.048,0.905,0.047,those were the people who were guided by god so follow their way say ask no recompense of you for this it is but reminder for all the people of the world
Al-Anam,80,0.8462,0.096,0.724,0.18,but they failed to make just estimation of god when they said he did not reveal to any man any thing ask them who then revealed the book that moses brought guidance and light for men which you treat a sheaf of paper which you display yet conceal great deal though through it you were taught thing you did not know before nor even your father knew say god and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse

Al-Araf,14,0.4019,0.0,0.828,0.172,the elder of his people replied we see clearly that you have gone astray
Al-Araf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,have not gone astray my people he said but have been sent by my lord the creator of all the world
Al-Araf,22,0.5859,0.0,0.806,0.194,bring to you the message of my lord and give you sincere advice for know from god what you do not know
Al-Araf,36,0.0,0.159,0.682,0.159,do you wonder that warning ha come to you from your lord through man who is one of you and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear god you might be treated with mercy
Al-Araf,29,-0.9109,0.332,0.582,0.086,but they called him liar and we saved him and those with him in the ark and drowned the others who rejected our sign for they were people purblind
Al-Araf,32,0.2732,0.047,0.816,0.137,and we sent hud their brother to the people of ad he said you people worship god for you have no other god but he will you not take heed for yourselves
Al-Araf,19,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,the chief of his people who were infidel replied we find you full of folly and liar to boot
Al-Araf,17,0.1786,0.0,0.904,0.096,am not fool people he answered but have been sent by the lord of all the world
Al-Araf,12,0.7096,0.0,0.629,0.371,bring to you the message of my lord am your sincere friend
Al-Araf,52,0.9062,0.059,0.689,0.252,do you wonder that warning ha come to you from your lord through man who is one of you and warns you remember he made you leader after the people of noah and gave you greater increase in your stature so think of the favour of god you may haply be blessed
Al-Araf,38,0.6808,0.116,0.644,0.24,they answered have you come to say to u that we should worship only one god abandoning those our ancestor had worshipped if so bring on u what you threaten u with if what you say is true
Al-Araf,44,-0.7184,0.161,0.797,0.042,he replied you have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of god why dispute with me about name invented by you and your ancestor for which no sanction wa sent down so wait for what is to come am waiting with you
Al-Araf,27,-0.3612,0.245,0.548,0.206,then we saved him and those on his side by our grace and destroyed to the very last those who rejected our sign and denied the truth
Al-Araf,61,0.9018,0.134,0.575,0.291,we sent to thamud their brother saleh you people said he worship god for you have no other god but he clear proof ha come to you already from your lord and this she camel of god is the token for you leave her free to graze upon god earth and do not molest her lest grievous punishment should befall you
Al-Araf,48,0.6249,0.0,0.881,0.119,remember how you were made leader after the people of ad and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plain palace and carve dwelling out of mountain so think of the favour of god and do not act with corruption in the land
Al-Araf,40,-0.3182,0.13,0.768,0.102,the chief among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker one among them who believed asked do you really know that saleh ha been sent by his lord they said indeed we believe in the message he ha brought
Al-Araf,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,those who were arrogant answered we do not believe in what you believe
Al-Araf,32,0.0772,0.06,0.871,0.069,then they hamstrung the she camel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said bring saleh on u the affliction you promise if you are one of the sent one
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they were seized by an earthquake and lay overturned on the ground in their home in the morning
Al-Araf,30,0.4561,0.116,0.714,0.17,saleh turned away from them and said my people conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you do not like those who wish you well
Al-Araf,24,0.6908,0.0,0.758,0.242,and we sent lot who said to his people why do you commit this lecherous act which none in the world ha committed before
Al-Araf,19,0.0516,0.123,0.746,0.132,in preference to woman you satisfy your lust with men indeed you are people who are guilty of excess
Al-Araf,19,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,his people made no answer and only said drive them out of the city they profess to be pure
Al-Araf,19,0.5719,0.0,0.829,0.171,but we saved him and his family except for his wife who wa one of those who stayed behind
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and we rained down on them shower of stone so witness the end of sinner
Al-Araf,68,0.9552,0.02,0.734,0.246,remember we sent to midian their brother shu aib you people he said worship god for you have no other god but he clear proof ha come to you from your lord so give in full measure and full weight do not keep back from people what is theirs and do not corrupt the land after it ha been reformed this is best for you if you believe
Al-Araf,45,-0.4019,0.12,0.774,0.106,do not lie in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of god those who believe in him nor seek obliquity in it remember the day when you were few and he increased your number so consider the fate of those who were evil
Al-Araf,32,0.8271,0.0,0.763,0.237,if some of you believe what ha been sent through me and some of you do not have patience until god decide between u for he is the best of all judge
Al-Araf,40,-0.7003,0.147,0.811,0.042,the arrogant leader of the people replied we shall drive you away from our land shu aib and those who are with you unless you come back to your faith but he remarked even if we are disgusted with it
Al-Araf,38,0.9274,0.055,0.586,0.359,we shall only be guilty of blaspheming god if we accept your way after the people of noah and gave you greater increase in your stature so think of the favour of god you may haply be blessed
Al-Araf,25,-0.0516,0.107,0.793,0.1,the chief among his people who did not believe said to them if you follow shu aib and his way you will surely be ruined
Al-Araf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then they were seized by an earthquake and lay overturned on the ground in their home in the morning
Al-Araf,26,-0.891,0.356,0.644,0.0,they who called shu aib liar disappeared a though they had never existed and those who called shu aib liar were the one who were ruined
Al-Araf,35,-0.775,0.195,0.805,0.0,so shu aib turned away from them and said people conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you paid no heed how can grieve for people who do not believe
Al-Araf,24,-0.6249,0.188,0.812,0.0,there is not region to which we sent prophet and did not inflict upon it people adversity and hardship so that they may submit
Al-Araf,31,0.7351,0.156,0.573,0.271,but when we changed hardship to ease and they rose and prospered they forgot our favour and said our ancestor had also known suffering and joy so we caught them unawares
Al-Araf,37,0.4767,0.212,0.523,0.266,but if the people of these region had believed and feared god we would surely have showered on them blessing of the heaven and the earth but they only denied and we punished them for their deed
Al-Araf,18,-0.2225,0.226,0.633,0.141,are the people of the region so secure that they lie asleep unaware a our punishment overtakes them
Al-Araf,30,0.4588,0.0,0.875,0.125,or are the people of the town so unafraid that even when our retribution come upon them in the hour of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play
Al-Araf,24,0.7184,0.096,0.559,0.345,can they remain secure against the plan of god only they feel secure against the plan of god who are certain of being ruined
Al-Araf,40,0.1531,0.079,0.808,0.114,do not the people who inherited the earth from the earlier inhabitant perceive that we could afflict them too for their sin if we pleased and put seal on their heart that they may not hear the voice of truth
Al-Araf,40,-0.1027,0.085,0.817,0.098,these were the earlier habitation whose account we have given to you their apostle came with clear proof but they did not believe what they once denied that is how god seal the heart of those who do not believe
Al-Araf,17,0.6369,0.0,0.743,0.257,we did not find many of them faithful to their promise and found many of them disobedient
Al-Araf,31,-0.5719,0.158,0.727,0.114,so we sent moses with miracle after these apostle to the pharaoh and his noble but they behaved with them high handedly see then the end of the author of evil
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said pharaoh have been sent by the lord of all the world
Al-Araf,27,0.7134,0.044,0.756,0.2,am duty bound to speak nothing of god but the truth have brought from your lord clear sign so let the people of israel depart with me
Al-Araf,16,0.4215,0.0,0.843,0.157,he said if you have brought sign then display it if what you say is true
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,at this moses threw down his staff and lo it became live serpent
Al-Araf,16,0.4939,0.0,0.824,0.176,and he drew forth his hand and behold it looked white to those who beheld it
Al-Araf,10,0.836,0.0,0.44,0.56,the noble of pharaoh said he surely is clever magician
Al-Araf,14,0.4019,0.0,0.828,0.172,he wish to drive you away from the land so what do you advise
Al-Araf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said put him and his brother off awhile and send out herald to the city
Al-Araf,8,0.4767,0.0,0.693,0.307,to bring all the wise magician to you
Al-Araf,16,0.7845,0.0,0.653,0.347,the magician came to the pharaoh and said is there reward for u if we succeed
Al-Araf,9,0.7096,0.0,0.543,0.457,yes said he you will be among the honoured
Al-Araf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so they said moses you may cast your spell first or we shall cast ours
Al-Araf,26,0.5106,0.105,0.691,0.204,you cast it first answered moses when they cast their spell they bewitched the eye of the people and petrified them by conjuring up great charm
Al-Araf,17,-0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,we said to moses throw down your staff and it swallowed up their conjuration in no time
Al-Araf,13,0.25,0.089,0.753,0.158,thus the truth wa upheld and the falsehood that they practised wa exposed
Al-Araf,10,-0.34,0.211,0.789,0.0,thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown humiliated
Al-Araf,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the sorcerer fell to the ground in homage
Al-Araf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and said we have come to believe in the lord of all the world
Al-Araf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lord of moses and aaron
Al-Araf,34,0.6264,0.09,0.724,0.186,but pharaoh said you have come to accept belief in him without my permission this surely is plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land you will soon come to know
Al-Araf,16,0.2732,0.109,0.725,0.166,will have your hand and foot on alternate side cut off and have you all crucified
Al-Araf,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they answered we have in any case to go back to our lord
Al-Araf,36,-0.8225,0.202,0.798,0.0,the only reason you have to hate u is that we believed in the sign of our lord a they came to u our lord give u sufficient endurance that we may die submitting to you
Al-Araf,43,0.1027,0.096,0.779,0.125,and the leader of pharaoh people said to him would you allow moses and his people to create disorder in the land and discard you and your god he replied we shall now slay their son and spare their woman and subdue them
Al-Araf,38,0.7096,0.0,0.835,0.165,said moses to his people invoke the help of god and be firm the earth belongs to god he can make whom he will among his creature inherit it the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
Al-Araf,42,-0.7845,0.201,0.716,0.083,they said we were oppressed before you came and have been since you have come to u he answered it may well be that soon god may destroy your enemy and make you inherit the land and then see how you behave
Al-Araf,17,-0.7003,0.279,0.721,0.0,we afflicted the people of pharaoh with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed
Al-Araf,44,0.8151,0.0,0.829,0.171,yet when good came their way they said it is our due but when misfortune befell them they put the omen down to moses and those who were with him but surely the omen wa with god yet most of them did not understand
Al-Araf,17,-0.4019,0.153,0.847,0.0,they said whatsoever the sign you have brought to deceive u we shall not believe in you
Al-Araf,30,-0.8997,0.289,0.711,0.0,so we let loose on them flood and locust and vermin frog and blood how many different sign but they still remained arrogant for they were people full of sin
Al-Araf,38,-0.2023,0.081,0.859,0.061,yet when punishment overtook them they said moses invoke your lord for u a you have been enjoined if the torment is removed we shall certainly believe in you and let the people of israel go with you
Al-Araf,21,-0.6124,0.321,0.476,0.202,but no sooner wa the punishment withdrawn for time to enable them to make good their promise than they broke it
Al-Araf,20,-0.7845,0.277,0.723,0.0,so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for rejecting our sign and not heeding them
Al-Araf,61,0.0516,0.155,0.674,0.171,we then made the people who were weak and oppressed successor of the land to the east and the west which we had blessed thus the fair promise of your lord to the child of israel wa fulfilled for they were patient in adversity and whatsoever the pharaoh and his people had fashioned and the structure they had raised were destroyed
Al-Araf,35,0.6369,0.053,0.761,0.185,when we brought the child of israel across the sea and they came to people who were devoted to their idol they said moses make u also god like theirs you are ignorant he replied
Al-Araf,15,-0.0772,0.168,0.681,0.152,these people and their way will surely be destroyed for false is what they practise
Al-Araf,26,0.7096,0.0,0.736,0.264,do you want me to seek for you he said god other than god when he ha exalted you over all the nation of the world
Al-Araf,33,0.3182,0.135,0.699,0.166,remember the day when he saved you from the people of pharaoh who oppressed and afflicted you and slew your son and spared your woman in this wa great trial from your lord
Al-Araf,55,-0.6597,0.075,0.925,0.0,we made an appointment of thirty night with moses on mount sinai to which we added ten more so the term set by the lord wa completed in forty night moses said to aaron his brother deputise for me among my people dispose rightly and do not follow the way of the author of evil
Al-Araf,89,0.6956,0.0,0.949,0.051,when moses arrived at the appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said lord reveal yourself to me that may behold you you cannot behold me he said but look at the mountain if it remains firm in it place you may then behold me but when his lord appeared on the mountain in his effulgence it crumbled to heap of dust and moses fell unconscious when he came to he said all glory to you turn to you in repentance and am the first to believe
Al-Araf,25,0.4588,0.0,0.889,0.111,said the lord moses raised you above all men by sending my message and speaking to you so receive what give you and be grateful
Al-Araf,40,0.5267,0.072,0.784,0.144,and we wrote down on tablet admonition and clear explanation of all thing for moses and ordered him hold fast to them and command your people to observe the best in them will show you the abode of the wicked
Al-Araf,76,-0.7269,0.076,0.924,0.0,will turn those away from my sign who behave unjustly with arrogance in the land so that even though they see all the sign they will not believe in them and if they see the path of rectitude will not take it to be way and if they see the way of error take it to be the right path this is so for they have called our message lie and have been heedless of them
Al-Araf,27,-0.128,0.121,0.808,0.071,vain are the act of those who deny our sign and the meeting in the hereafter can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
Al-Araf,50,-0.296,0.058,0.906,0.036,in the absence of moses his people prepared the image of calf from their ornament which gave out the mooing of cow yet they did not see it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the right path even then they took it for deity and did wrong
Al-Araf,26,-0.3213,0.206,0.697,0.096,then they were filled with remorse and saw that they had erred and said if our lord doe not forgive u we will surely be lost
Al-Araf,74,-0.8465,0.177,0.736,0.086,when moses returned to his people indignant and grieved he said how wickedly you behaved in my absence why must you hasten the decree of your lord and he cast aside the tablet and pulled his brother by the hair son of my mother said aaron these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me do not let my enemy rejoice at my plight and do not put me down among transgressor
Al-Araf,22,0.8479,0.0,0.625,0.375,moses said lord forgive me and my brother and admit u to your grace for you are the most compassionate of all
Al-Araf,30,-0.7506,0.264,0.609,0.127,surely those who have taken the calf a god will suffer the anger of their lord and disgrace in the world that is how we requite those who fabricate lie
Al-Araf,18,0.7003,0.119,0.538,0.342,yet those who do wrong then repent and believe are forgiven for your lord is forgiving and kind
Al-Araf,22,-0.6249,0.24,0.662,0.098,when his anger subsided moses picked up the tablet inscribed on them wa guidance and grace for those who fear their lord
Al-Araf,87,0.9625,0.038,0.748,0.215,moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment on mount sinai when they arrived they were seized by tremor moses said lord if you had so pleased you could have annihilated them and me before this will you destroy u for something the foolish among u have done this is but trial from you whereby you will lead whom you will astray and guide whom you please you are our saviour so forgive u and have mercy on u for you are the best of forgiver
Al-Araf,52,0.431,0.092,0.783,0.124,enjoin for u good in the world and good in the world to come we turn to you alone and the lord said punish only those whom will but my mercy enfolds everything shall enjoin it for those who take heed for themselves who pay the zakat and believe in my sign
Al-Araf,67,0.7096,0.111,0.707,0.182,who follow the messenger the gentile prophet described in the torah and the gospel who bid thing noble and forbids thing vile make lawful what is clean and prohibits what is foul who relief them of their burden and the yoke that lie upon them those who believe and honour and help him and follow the light sent with him are those who will attain their goal
Al-Araf,61,0.6059,0.094,0.704,0.202,say men am verily the apostle of god to you all his whose kingdom extends over the heaven and the earth there is no god but he the giver of life and death so believe in god and the messenger the gentile prophet sent by him who belief in god and his message obey him you may haply be guided aright
Al-Araf,21,0.3182,0.0,0.897,0.103,among the people of moses is section that show the way to the truth and deal justly in accordance with it
Al-Araf,83,0.8319,0.014,0.883,0.103,we divided them into twelve different tribe when his people asked for water we said to moses strike the rock with your staff and behold twelve spring of water gushed forth so that each of the tribe had place of it own to drink and we made the cloud spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quail and said eat of the good thing we have provided for you but by disobeying they did not harm u they harmed themselves
Al-Araf,49,-0.1164,0.089,0.829,0.081,and when it wa said to them live in this land and eat of it produce wheresoever you like and ask for remission of your sin but pas through the gate with submission and not pride we shall forgive your trespass and give to those who are righteous abundance
Al-Araf,27,-0.7717,0.275,0.634,0.091,the wicked among them changed and perverted the word we had spoken to word unpronounced so we sent from heaven retribution on them for all their wickedness
Al-Araf,52,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,enquire of them about the town situated by the sea where when they did not keep the sabbath the fish came up to the surface of the water for them but on day other than the sabbath the fish did not come we tried them in this way for they were disobedient
Al-Araf,36,-0.8658,0.308,0.557,0.135,when section of them said why do you admonish people whom god is about to destroy or to punish severely they replied to clear ourselves of blame before your lord and that they may fear god
Al-Araf,25,-0.965,0.492,0.426,0.083,but when they forgot to remember the warning we saved those who prohibited evil but inflicted on the wicked dreadful punishment requital for their disobedience
Al-Araf,18,-0.4588,0.239,0.652,0.109,when they persisted in doing what they had been forbidden we said to them become like ape despised
Al-Araf,36,0.2023,0.18,0.602,0.218,and your lord declared he would send men against them who would inflict dreadful suffering on them till the day of doom for your lord is swift in retribution though he is certainly forgiving and kind
Al-Araf,27,-0.1531,0.111,0.796,0.092,we dispersed them in group over the earth some righteous some otherwise and we tried them with good thing and bad that they may haply turn back
Al-Araf,81,0.85,0.046,0.778,0.176,then after them new generation inherited the book they took to the thing of this base world and said we shall surely be forgiven this yet they will accept similar thing if they came their way again had they not been covenanted in the book to say nothing in the name of god but the truth and they have read this in it the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god can they not comprehend
Al-Araf,28,0.3818,0.087,0.745,0.168,a for those who adhere to the book and are firm in devotion we shall certainly not let the wage of those who are upright to go waste
Al-Araf,43,-0.2732,0.098,0.849,0.053,the day we shook the mountain above them like an awning and they feared it would fall over them we said hold fast to what we have given you and bear in mind what is said therein so that you may take heed
Al-Araf,48,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when your lord brings forth from their loin the offspring of the child of adam he make them witness over themselves and asks am not your lord indeed they reply we bear witness lest you should say on the day of resurrection we were not aware of this
Al-Araf,33,-0.5106,0.148,0.795,0.058,or lest they should say it were our father who had ascribed compeer to god we are only their offspring will you destroy u for the deed of those who dealt in vanity
Al-Araf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is how we explain our sign distinctly so that they may come back to the right path
Al-Araf,28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,relate to them the plight of the man whom we gave our sign but he passed them by so that satan came after him and he went astray
Al-Araf,59,0.1154,0.103,0.818,0.08,we wished to exalt him but he loved baseness and followed his lust his likeness is that of dog who hang out his tongue if you drive him away and still hang it out if you leave him alone such is the case of the people who deny our sign narrate this history to them they may haply reflect
Al-Araf,13,-0.872,0.497,0.503,0.0,evil is the case of those who deny our sign and wrong themselves
Al-Araf,17,0.1779,0.193,0.583,0.224,he alone is guided whom god show the way and whom he lead astray is surely lost

Yusuf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when joseph told his father my father saw eleven star and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage
Yusuf,23,-0.1877,0.168,0.726,0.105,he said son do not narrate your dream to your brother or they will plot against you surely satan is man acknowledged foe
Yusuf,48,0.7184,0.0,0.882,0.118,your lord will choose you and teach you to interpret event and confer his favour on you and the house of jacob a he had done in the case of two ancestor of yours abraham and isaac before you indeed your lord is all knowing and all wise
Yusuf,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in the story of joseph and his brother are lesson for those who inquire
Yusuf,30,0.7717,0.08,0.643,0.278,surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we said his half brother even though we are well knit band our father is surely in the wrong
Yusuf,23,0.4588,0.15,0.541,0.309,let u kill joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father exclusive affection then play innocent
Yusuf,27,0.858,0.0,0.717,0.283,one of them said if you must do so then do not kill joseph but throw him into an unused well some passing caravan may rescue him
Yusuf,22,0.6597,0.0,0.779,0.221,then going to their father they said father why don you trust u with joseph we are in fact his well wishers
Yusuf,19,0.8316,0.0,0.63,0.37,let him go out with u tomorrow that he may enjoy and play we shall take care of him
Yusuf,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said am afraid of sending him with you lest wolf should devour him when you are unmindful
Yusuf,19,0.5423,0.0,0.791,0.209,they replied if wolf should devour him when we are there well knit band we shall certainly be treacherous
Yusuf,34,0.2732,0.0,0.94,0.06,so when they took him out they planned to throw him into an unused well we revealed to joseph you will tell them one day of this deed when they will not apprehend it
Yusuf,8,-0.4404,0.293,0.707,0.0,at nightfall they came to their father weeping
Yusuf,31,0.4497,0.0,0.908,0.092,and said we went racing with one another and left joseph to guard our thing when wolf devoured him but you will not believe u even though we tell the truth
Yusuf,37,0.7906,0.045,0.75,0.205,they showed him the shirt with false blood on it their father said it is not so you have made up the story yet endurance is best seek the help of god alone for what you impute
Yusuf,51,0.6124,0.022,0.861,0.116,caravan happened to pas and sent the water carrier to bring water from the well he let down his bucket and pulled joseph up with it what luck said the man here is boy and they hid him a an item of merchandise but what they did wa known to god
Yusuf,10,-0.4404,0.266,0.734,0.0,and they sold him a worthless for few paltry dirham
Yusuf,51,0.5859,0.0,0.888,0.112,the egyptian who bought him instructed his wife house him honourably he may be of use to u we may even adopt him a son so we firmly established joseph in the land and taught him the interpretation of dream god dominated in his affair though most men do not know
Yusuf,20,0.886,0.0,0.584,0.416,when he reached the prime of life we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus we reward those who are good
Yusuf,40,0.8847,0.058,0.683,0.26,but she in whose house he resided wished to seduce him and closing the door said come into me god forbid he said he is my master who ha approved my stay surely those who act wrongly do not prosper
Yusuf,41,-0.1154,0.154,0.681,0.165,but the woman desired him and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his lord this wa so that we may avert both evil and lechery from him for he wa one of our chosen devotee
Yusuf,43,-0.9194,0.27,0.73,0.0,both of them raced to the door and she grabbed and rent his shirt from behind they met her lord outside the door there is no other penalty for man said she who wanted to outrage your wife but imprisonment or grievous punishment

Yusuf,20,0.6486,0.0,0.773,0.227,and certainly the recompense of the life to come is better for those who believe and follow the right path

Al-Kahf,51,0.765,0.0,0.881,0.119,persevere with those who call on their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence do not turn your eye away from them seeking the splendour of this world and do not follow him whose heart we have made oblivious to our remembrance who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound
Al-Kahf,61,-0.6124,0.151,0.726,0.124,say the truth is from your lord so believe if you like or do not believe if you will we have prepared for the sinner fire which will envelope them in it tent if they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouth how evil the drink and evil the resting place
Al-Kahf,19,-0.5923,0.279,0.581,0.14,but surely we do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste
Al-Kahf,43,0.8126,0.0,0.847,0.153,there will be garden of eden for them with river flowing by where they will be decked in bracelet of gold with silken robe of green and of brocade to wear reclining on couch how excellent the guerdon and excellent the resting place
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,tell them the parable of two men we gave one two garden of grape surrounded by date palm tree with corn field in between
Al-Kahf,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,each of the garden yielded it fruit and did not withhold the least and we made stream flow in between them
Al-Kahf,21,0.8922,0.092,0.49,0.418,so he became rich arguing one day with his friend he said have more wealth than you and more powerful kinsman
Al-Kahf,19,-0.4767,0.147,0.853,0.0,and he walked into his garden and forgetting his limit said cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined
Al-Kahf,27,0.4767,0.083,0.738,0.178,nor can think that the hour of doom will come and even if am brought back to my lord will surely find better place there than this
Al-Kahf,25,-0.6124,0.233,0.7,0.067,disputing with him his companion said do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then drop of semen then formed you into man
Al-Kahf,15,0.2732,0.0,0.87,0.13,and he is god my lord and do not associate any one with my lord
Al-Kahf,34,0.1461,0.197,0.616,0.187,when you entered your garden why did you not say a god may please for no one ha power except given by god though you see me poorer in wealth and child than you
Al-Kahf,29,0.4404,0.0,0.906,0.094,yet my lord may haply give me garden better than yours and he may send thunder bolt from the sky and in the morning it will be barren plain
Al-Kahf,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,or else of morning it water may sink underground and you will not find trace of it
Al-Kahf,47,-0.5574,0.158,0.747,0.094,and his vine were overtaken with disaster and he began to wring his hand at the loss of what he had spent on them for the vine had fallen upon their trellis and he said would to god that had not associated any one with my lord
Al-Kahf,17,0.7003,0.095,0.56,0.345,he had no body to help him other than god nor wa he able to save himself
Al-Kahf,18,0.9349,0.0,0.496,0.504,the jurisdiction in this province belongs to god his is the best reward and his the best requital
Al-Kahf,50,0.7745,0.0,0.859,0.141,present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water we send down from the sky that mingles with the earth to nourish it vegetation which then on the morrow turn to stubble and is blown away by the wind god ha power over everything
Al-Kahf,26,0.928,0.0,0.617,0.383,wealth and child are only the gloss of this world but good deed that abide are better with your lord for recompense and better for expectation
Al-Kahf,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day we shall move the mountain and you see the earth an open plain we shall gather them together leaving none behind
Al-Kahf,38,0.2263,0.056,0.84,0.104,they will be arraigned before their lord row on row and he will say well you have come to u a we had first created you even though you imagined we had fixed no time for this meeting
Al-Kahf,54,0.6315,0.063,0.792,0.145,the ledger of their deed would be placed before them then you will see the sinner terrified at it content and say ala what written revelation this which ha not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing they will find in it whatsoever they had done your lord doe not wrong any one
Al-Kahf,55,-0.9144,0.242,0.664,0.093,when we said to the angel bow before adam in adoration they all bowed but iblis he wa one of the jinni and rebelled against his lord command and yet you take him and his offspring a your friend instead of me even though they are your enemy how sad substitute for the evil doer
Al-Kahf,28,0.6667,0.063,0.707,0.231,did not call them to witness the creation of the heaven and the earth nor their own creation would not take a helper those who lead men astray
Al-Kahf,28,-0.4215,0.094,0.906,0.0,the day he will say call those you had called my compeer they will call them but will get no response and we shall place gulf between them
Al-Kahf,24,-0.1779,0.092,0.843,0.065,the sinner will see the fire and know that they will be thrown into it and will not find way of escape from it
Al-Kahf,22,-0.5006,0.134,0.866,0.0,we have explained in various way all thing to men in this qur an but of all thing man is most contentious
Al-Kahf,41,0.1346,0.093,0.781,0.126,there is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance ha come to them and asking for their lord forgiveness unless they want the example of earlier people visited upon them or the punishment to appear right before their eye
Al-Kahf,37,-0.4497,0.257,0.563,0.18,we never send apostle but to convey happy tidings and to warn but those who disbelieve contend with false argument to nullify the truth they make mockery of my revelation and of what they had been warned
Al-Kahf,63,-0.7841,0.114,0.856,0.03,who is more unjust than he who on being reminded of his lord revelation turn away from them and forgets the evil deed he had committed in the past verily we have placed covering on their heart so that they do not understand and deafness in their ear so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright
Al-Kahf,37,0.2263,0.208,0.548,0.243,but your lord is forgiving full of benevolence if he had pleased to punish them for their doings he would have punished them immediately but term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape
Al-Kahf,20,-0.4939,0.151,0.849,0.0,a for these habitation we destroyed them only when they transgressed even so we had fixed time for their annihilation
Al-Kahf,24,0.0258,0.0,0.954,0.046,when moses said to his servant joshua will not give up till reach the confluence of two ocean or will journey on and on
Al-Kahf,22,0.3818,0.0,0.841,0.159,when they reached the confluence they forgot the fish they had brought a food which swiftly made it way into the sea
Al-Kahf,21,-0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,when they had gone past the confluence moses said to his servant give me my breakfast am exhausted from this journey
Al-Kahf,32,-0.2263,0.088,0.912,0.0,he said you see forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped only satan made me forget to mention this but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said but that is exactly what we were seeking so they retraced their step
Al-Kahf,16,0.5994,0.0,0.782,0.218,then they found one of our votary whom we had blessed and given knowledge from u
Al-Kahf,24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,moses said to him may attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way
Al-Kahf,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said you will not be able to bear with me
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,how can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension
Al-Kahf,18,0.2732,0.0,0.89,0.11,you will find me patient if god will said moses and will not disobey you in any thing
Al-Kahf,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if you must follow me he said do not ask me any thing until speak of it to you myself
Al-Kahf,39,-0.6705,0.129,0.871,0.0,so they set out till they came to the quay and went on board ship in which he made hole and moses said you have made hole in the boat to drown it passenger you have done strange thing
Al-Kahf,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,did not tell you he replied that you will not be able to bear with me
Al-Kahf,19,-0.5267,0.206,0.794,0.0,moses said do not hold me for having forgotten and do not reprove me and make my task difficult
Al-Kahf,31,-0.8689,0.276,0.665,0.059,the two went on till they came to boy whom he killed moses exclaimed you have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life you have done most abominable thing
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said did not tell you you will not be able to bear with me
Al-Kahf,19,0.0516,0.0,0.938,0.062,moses said if ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you you have my apology
Al-Kahf,44,0.3612,0.099,0.772,0.128,the two went on till they came upon some villager and asked the people for food but they refused to entertain them there they found wall that wa crumbling which he repaired moses remarked you could have demanded wage for it if you liked
Al-Kahf,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this is the parting of our way he said but will now explain the thing you could not bear
Al-Kahf,29,-0.7184,0.182,0.818,0.0,that boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea damaged it because there wa king after them who used to seize every ship by force
Al-Kahf,20,-0.8625,0.336,0.664,0.0,a for the boy his parent were believer but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief
Al-Kahf,15,0.8834,0.0,0.493,0.507,we hoped their lord would give them substitute better than him in virtue and goodness
Al-Kahf,69,0.7964,0.0,0.874,0.126,a for that wall it belonged to two orphan boy of the city and their treasure wa buried under it their father wa an upright man so your lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure a favour from their lord so did not do that of my own accord this is the explanation of thing you could not bear with patience
Al-Kahf,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they ask you about dhu qarnain
Al-Kahf,20,0.0772,0.0,0.936,0.064,say will cite before you his commemoration we gave him authority in the land and mean of accomplishing every end
Al-Kahf,5,0.3321,0.0,0.629,0.371,so he followed certain road
Al-Kahf,35,0.4019,0.082,0.747,0.171,till he reached the point of the setting sun and saw it set behind muddy lake and near it found people we said dhu qarnain you may either punish them or treat them with kindness
Al-Kahf,23,-0.9201,0.408,0.592,0.0,he said shall punish whosoever is wicked he will then be sent back to his lord who will inflict on him terrible punishment
Al-Kahf,21,0.9428,0.0,0.563,0.437,but he who belief and doe the right will have an excellent reward and we shall make thing easy for him
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he then followed another road
Al-Kahf,24,-0.2023,0.086,0.859,0.055,till he reached the point of the rising sun and saw it rise over people for whom we had provided no shelter against it
Al-Kahf,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it wa so for we were fully informed about him
Al-Kahf,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he then followed another road
Al-Kahf,22,0.0516,0.0,0.946,0.054,till he reached place between two mountain and found this side of it people who understood but little of what wa spoken
Al-Kahf,27,-0.1027,0.053,0.947,0.0,they said dhu qarnain gog and magog are oppressing the land may we pay you some tribute so that you could build rampart between u and them
Al-Kahf,25,0.8776,0.0,0.654,0.346,he said the ability my lord ha given me is better so help me with your manual labour will build wall between you and them
Al-Kahf,42,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,bring me ingot of iron which they did until the space between two mountain side wa filled up blow your bellow he said and they blew until it wa red hot bring me molten brass he said that may pour over it
Al-Kahf,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,thus gog and magog could neither climb over it nor dig hole through the rampart
Al-Kahf,35,0.8873,0.0,0.73,0.27,this is the benevolence of my lord he said but when the promise of my lord come to pas he will reduce it to mound of dust and the promise of my lord is true
Al-Kahf,29,0.3182,0.039,0.879,0.081,we shall leave them on that day surging like wave pressing one against the other and the trumpet blast will be sounded when we shall gather them all together
Al-Kahf,9,-0.6808,0.365,0.635,0.0,then we shall bring hell right before the infidel
Al-Kahf,12,-0.34,0.179,0.821,0.0,whose eye were veiled against my warning and they could not hear
Al-Kahf,23,-0.5719,0.167,0.764,0.069,do the unbeliever think they can make my own creature their protector against me we have prepared hell for the hospitality of infidel
Al-Kahf,9,-0.4939,0.286,0.714,0.0,say shall tell you whose labour will be wasted
Al-Kahf,22,0.765,0.0,0.752,0.248,theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasure of the world even though they think they are doing good thing
Al-Kahf,36,0.1226,0.068,0.853,0.08,they are those who reject the sign of their lord and the meeting with him so their good deed will be fruitless and on the day of judgement we shall not appoint any weighing for them
Al-Kahf,14,-0.7845,0.365,0.635,0.0,their requital will be hell because they disbelieved and mocked my sign and messenger
Al-Kahf,16,0.9382,0.0,0.471,0.529,but surely those who believe and do the right will have garden of paradise a gift
Al-Kahf,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where they will abide for ever never wanting change
Al-Kahf,41,0.0,0.057,0.886,0.057,say if the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my lord the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the word and wonder of my lord come to end even if we brought another like it for replenishment
Al-Kahf,45,0.9209,0.0,0.739,0.261,say am only man like you but it ha been communicated to me that your lord is one and single god and that whosoever hope to meet his lord should do what is right and not associate any one in the worship of his lord
Maryam,5,-0.1779,0.365,0.353,0.282,kaf ha ya ain sad
Maryam,10,0.7506,0.0,0.556,0.444,commemorate the beneficence of your lord on zachariah his devotee

Ta-Ha,25,0.0258,0.106,0.751,0.143,and said these two are surely magician they want to deprive you of your land with their magic and eradicate your distinct way of life
Ta-Ha,15,0.743,0.094,0.563,0.343,so prepare your strategy and come forward he alone shall win today who is superior

Ta-Ha,30,0.3818,0.087,0.723,0.191,we have certainly come to believe in our lord that he may forgive our trespass and the magic you have forced u to perform for god is nobler and abiding
Ta-Ha,19,0.1144,0.173,0.6,0.227,surely for him who come before his lord sinner shall be hell where he will neither die nor live
Ta-Ha,16,0.5927,0.0,0.796,0.204,but whoever come before him believer having done good deed will be raised to higher station

Ta-Ha,29,0.5586,0.046,0.797,0.157,we commanded moses journey by night with our creature and strike dry path for them through the sea do not fear being overtaken nor have dread of any thing
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the pharaoh followed them with his army but the sea overpowered and engulfed them
Ta-Ha,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the pharaoh had led his people astray and did not rightly guide them
Ta-Ha,29,-0.5423,0.111,0.889,0.0,child of israel we delivered you from your enemy and made covenant with you on the right side of the mount and sent down for you manna and quail

Ta-Ha,18,0.6705,0.0,0.744,0.256,yet am gracious to him who repents and belief and doe the right and follows the straight path
Ta-Ha,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what made you hurry away moses from your people

Ta-Ha,18,0.34,0.0,0.876,0.124,he said we have put your people on trial in your absence and sameri ha led them astray
Ta-Ha,56,-0.0258,0.136,0.715,0.149,so moses returned to his people full of anger and regret my people he said did not your lord make you better promise did the time of covenant seem too long to you or did you wish the wrath of your lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me
Ta-Ha,38,-0.5546,0.113,0.887,0.0,they said we did not break our promise to you of our own will but we were made to carry the load of ornament belonging to the people which we threw into the fire and so did sameri
Ta-Ha,27,0.5719,0.099,0.638,0.264,then he produced the image of calf which mooed like cow and they said this is your god and the god of moses whom he ha neglected
Ta-Ha,24,-0.0258,0.121,0.761,0.118,did they not see that it did not give them any answer nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain
Ta-Ha,28,0.5228,0.0,0.889,0.111,aaron had indeed told them earlier my people you are being only misled with this surely your lord is ar rahman so follow me and obey my command
Ta-Ha,25,0.4019,0.0,0.895,0.105,they said so long a moses doe not come back we are not going to give it up and we will remain devoted to it
Ta-Ha,15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but moses said aaron when you saw that they had gone astray what hindered you
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,from coming after me did you not disobey my command and moses pulled him by the hair
Ta-Ha,39,-0.0783,0.062,0.859,0.079,son of my mother aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair wa really afraid you may say that had created rift among the child of israel and did not pay heed to your command
Ta-Ha,7,0.0258,0.0,0.845,0.155,moses asked sameri what wa the matter
Ta-Ha,28,0.4404,0.0,0.903,0.097,he said saw what they did not see picked up handful of dust from the messenger track and threw it in for the idea seemed attractive to me
Ta-Ha,51,-0.1531,0.062,0.87,0.069,moses said go hence all your life you are cursed to say do not touch me and threat hang over you which you will not be able to escape look at your god to whom you are so attached we shall verily burn it and disperse it ash into the sea
Ta-Ha,17,0.4215,0.08,0.6,0.32,your god is only god there is no other god but he his knowledge extends over everything
Ta-Ha,23,0.6486,0.0,0.798,0.202,thus do we narrate some account to you of what ha gone before and we have truly given you reminder of our own

Ta-Ha,19,-0.875,0.385,0.615,0.0,and will live for ever under it how evil the burden they will carry on the day of doom
Ta-Ha,13,-0.4019,0.184,0.816,0.0,the day the trumpet blast is sounded we shall raise the sinner blind
Ta-Ha,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,whispering to one another you have tarried but ten day
Ta-Ha,22,0.2732,0.0,0.909,0.091,we know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say you did not tarry more than day
Ta-Ha,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they will ask you about the mountain tell them my lord will uproot them from the base
Ta-Ha,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and turn them into level plain
Ta-Ha,9,-0.296,0.216,0.784,0.0,over which you will see no curve or elevation
Ta-Ha,32,-0.1531,0.049,0.951,0.0,that day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding and their voice will be hushed before ar rahman and you will not hear sound but faint shuffling
Ta-Ha,17,0.4019,0.104,0.616,0.28,on that day no intercession will matter other than his whom ar rahman grant permission and accepts
Ta-Ha,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he know what is before them and hidden from them but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge
Ta-Ha,21,-0.3182,0.103,0.897,0.0,all head will be bowed before the living the eternal and whosoever bear load of iniquity will be full of despair
Ta-Ha,19,-0.8462,0.431,0.371,0.198,but he who ha done good thing and belief will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived
Ta-Ha,36,-0.4215,0.076,0.924,0.0,that is why we have sent it down a an eloquent qur an and explained in different way the intimidation through it that they may haply take heed or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate
Ta-Ha,29,0.775,0.0,0.77,0.23,exalted then be god the real king and do not try to anticipate the qur an before the completion of it revelation but pray lord give me greater knowledge
Ta-Ha,15,-0.5267,0.195,0.805,0.0,we had commanded adam before but he disregarded it we found him lacking in resolution
Ta-Ha,16,-0.4215,0.157,0.843,0.0,when we said to the angel bow before adam they all bowed but iblis who refused
Ta-Ha,26,0.1027,0.187,0.615,0.198,so we said adam he is truly your enemy and your wife do not let him have you turned out of paradise and come to grief
Ta-Ha,9,-0.4939,0.375,0.625,0.0,verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there
Ta-Ha,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,nor thirst nor exposure to the sun
Ta-Ha,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but then satan tempted him by saying adam should show you the tree of immortality and kingdom that will never know any wane
Ta-Ha,33,-0.25,0.088,0.912,0.0,and both ate of it fruit and their hidden part were exposed to one another and they patched the leaf of the garden to hide them adam disobeyed his lord and went astray
Ta-Ha,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then his lord chose him and relented towards him and showed him the way
Ta-Ha,32,0.1551,0.093,0.771,0.136,and said go down hence together one the enemy of the other then will guidance come to you from me and whoever follows my direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable
Ta-Ha,24,-0.9294,0.407,0.593,0.0,but he who fails to heed my warning will have his mean restricted and on the day of resurrection we shall raise him blind

Al-Anbiya,11,-0.7351,0.408,0.592,0.0,who are fearful of their lord inwardly and dread the hour
Al-Anbiya,15,0.3612,0.124,0.674,0.202,and this is blessed reminder that we have sent down will you then deny it
Al-Anbiya,12,0.5994,0.0,0.671,0.329,we had earlier given abraham true direction for we knew him well
Al-Anbiya,19,0.656,0.0,0.805,0.195,when he said to his father and his people what are these idol to which you cling so passionately
Al-Anbiya,8,0.3818,0.0,0.729,0.271,they replied we found our father worshipping them
Al-Anbiya,10,-0.0258,0.203,0.602,0.195,he said you and your father were in clear error
Al-Anbiya,10,0.5106,0.0,0.732,0.268,they said are you speaking in earnest or only jesting
Al-Anbiya,24,0.6486,0.0,0.806,0.194,he said in fact it wa your lord the lord of the heaven and the earth who created them and bear witness to this
Al-Anbiya,17,0.2263,0.066,0.82,0.115,swear by god will do something to your idol when you have turned your back and gone
Al-Anbiya,20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so he smashed them up to piece with the exception of the biggest so that they may turn to it
Al-Anbiya,16,0.5994,0.114,0.548,0.338,they asked on return who ha done this to our god he is surely mischief monger
Al-Anbiya,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they said we heard youth talk about them he is called abraham
Al-Anbiya,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,bring him before the people they said that they may bear witness
Al-Anbiya,10,0.2732,0.0,0.811,0.189,did you do this to our god abraham they enquired

Al-Anbiya,10,-0.1027,0.232,0.563,0.204,then they thought and observed surely you are yourselves unjust
Al-Anbiya,11,-0.1531,0.243,0.556,0.201,then crestfallen they confessed truly a you know they cannot speak
Al-Anbiya,20,-0.383,0.225,0.611,0.164,so abraham said then why do you worship something apart from god that cannot profit you or do you harm
Al-Anbiya,13,0.5106,0.0,0.719,0.281,fie on you and those you worship besides god will you not understand
Al-Anbiya,14,0.6486,0.0,0.694,0.306,they said burn him and save your god if you are men of action
Al-Anbiya,10,0.1027,0.182,0.606,0.212,turn cold fire we said and give safety to abraham
Al-Anbiya,11,-0.3291,0.273,0.534,0.193,they wished to entrap him but we made them greater loser
Al-Anbiya,19,0.5994,0.0,0.822,0.178,so we delivered him and lot and brought them to the land we had blessed for all the people
Al-Anbiya,16,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172,and we bestowed on him isaac and jacob a an additional gift and made them righteous
Al-Anbiya,33,0.6908,0.038,0.795,0.167,and we made them leader to guide the people by our command and we inspired them to perform good deed and observe their moral obligation and pay the zakat and they obeyed u
Al-Anbiya,21,0.0772,0.229,0.502,0.27,to lot we gave wisdom and knowledge and saved him from people who acted villainously and were certainly wicked and disobedient
Al-Anbiya,14,0.7269,0.0,0.608,0.392,thus we admitted him to our grace he is surely one of the righteous
Al-Anbiya,22,0.5423,0.12,0.636,0.244,remember noah when he called to u before this we heard him and saved him and those with him from great distress
Al-Anbiya,25,-0.8974,0.341,0.659,0.0,and we helped him against the people who rejected our sign a lie they were wicked people indeed so we drowned them one and all
Al-Anbiya,29,0.2732,0.0,0.93,0.07,remember david and solomon when they pronounced judgement about the field which wa eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people we were witness to their judgement
Al-Anbiya,35,0.7906,0.0,0.825,0.175,we made solomon understand the case and bestowed on each wisdom and knowledge we subdued the al jibal mountain with david to sing our praise and at tair bird it is we who did it
Al-Anbiya,25,-0.7636,0.222,0.778,0.0,and we taught him the art of making coat of mail to shield you from each other violence will you not be grateful even then
Al-Anbiya,29,0.7269,0.0,0.816,0.184,we made tempestuous wind obedient to solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding with his ship to the land we had blessed we are cognisant of everything
Al-Anbiya,26,-0.6597,0.15,0.85,0.0,and many of the devil we also made obedient to him who dived for him and did many other thing and we kept watch over them
Al-Anbiya,20,-0.3415,0.224,0.644,0.132,remember job when he called to his lord am afflicted with distress and you are the most compassionate of all

Al-Anbiya,44,-0.4215,0.199,0.651,0.15,and remember dhu noon jonah of the fish when he went away in anger and imagined we will not test him with distress then he called out from the darkness there is no god other than you all glory to you surely wa sinner
Al-Anbiya,18,-0.6369,0.282,0.605,0.113,we heard his cry and saved him from the anguish that is how we deliver those who believe
Al-Anbiya,22,0.817,0.0,0.655,0.345,remember zachariah when he called to his lord do not leave me alone and childless for you are the best of giver
Al-Anbiya,38,0.7964,0.0,0.827,0.173,so we heard him and gave him john and cured his wife of barrenness these were men who vied in good deed with one another and prayed to u with love and awe and were meek before u
Al-Anbiya,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,remember her who preserved her chastity into whom we breathed new life from u and made her and her son token for mankind

Al-Anbiya,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but they split up the order among themselves yet all of them have to come back to me
Al-Anbiya,21,-0.4404,0.127,0.873,0.0,so he who doe the right and is believer will not have his labour denied for we are congnisant of it
Al-Anbiya,13,-0.4939,0.211,0.789,0.0,it is imperative that habitation we have destroyed will not desist from unbelief

Al-Qasas,3,-0.5574,0.643,0.357,0.0,ta sin mim
Al-Qasas,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,these are the verse of the illuminating book
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we narrate to you from the history of moses and pharaoh in all verity for those who believe
Al-Qasas,33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the pharaoh had become high and mighty in the land and divided the people into different class and impoverished one class slaying it male and sparing it woman for he wa indeed tyrant
Al-Qasas,17,0.0,0.139,0.721,0.139,we wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leader and heir
Al-Qasas,22,-0.4939,0.132,0.868,0.0,and establish them in the country and to make the pharaoh haman and their horde beware of what they feared from them
Al-Qasas,38,0.2565,0.066,0.821,0.113,so we conveyed to the mother of moses suckle him if you are afraid for him cast him in the river without any fear or regret for we shall restore him to you and make him an apostle
Al-Qasas,31,-0.6369,0.213,0.711,0.076,then he wa picked up by the family of pharaoh unaware that he would become their enemy and cause for regret surely the pharaoh haman and their horde were habitual sinner
Al-Qasas,44,0.8761,0.0,0.755,0.245,the pharaoh wife said he will be comfort to me and to you do not kill him he may well be of some advantage to u or we may adopt him a son they were not aware of what the future held in store
Al-Qasas,24,-0.5764,0.177,0.823,0.0,the mother of moses wa perturbed in the morning had we not strengthened her heart to remain believer she had almost given him away
Al-Qasas,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,she told his sister follow him so she kept an eye on him from distance unbeknown to them
Al-Qasas,27,0.25,0.072,0.822,0.105,we made moses refuse wet nurse so his sister said should tell you of household that could bring him up for you and take care of him
Al-Qasas,30,0.8745,0.0,0.649,0.351,thus we restored him to his mother that she may be tranquil and not grieve and know that the promise of god is true though most men do not know
Al-Qasas,22,0.743,0.0,0.76,0.24,when he had grown up to full maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge thus do we recompense the doer of good
Al-Qasas,71,-0.2263,0.144,0.723,0.133,he came to the city when the people were in care free mood and saw two men quarrelling one belonging to his community the other to his enemy the man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemy moses struck him blow with his fist and finished him off this is of satan doing he said he is certainly an enemy and corrupter
Al-Qasas,18,0.8316,0.111,0.429,0.461,lord he prayed have done wrong forgive me and god forgave him verily he is forgiving and kind
Al-Qasas,15,0.7124,0.0,0.669,0.331,moses said lord a you have been gracious to me will never aid the guilty
Al-Qasas,37,0.0516,0.119,0.757,0.124,in the morning he came to the city fearful and hesitant just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help again you are indeed meddlesome fellow moses said to him
Al-Qasas,44,-0.8934,0.295,0.556,0.148,then a he wa about to lay hand on the one who wa their common enemy he cried out moses do you want to kill me a you killed that person yesterday you only want to be tyrant in the land and no peacemaker
Al-Qasas,29,-0.2263,0.132,0.732,0.135,there came man running from the other part of the city moses he said the chief are deliberating to kill you go away from the city wish you well
Al-Qasas,17,-0.8225,0.381,0.619,0.0,so he left the city fearful and hesitant and prayed lord deliver me from these wicked people
Al-Qasas,19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then a he turned his face to midian he said maybe my lord will show me the right way
Al-Qasas,54,-0.4019,0.048,0.952,0.0,and when he came to the water of midian he found crowd of people watering their flock and saw two maiden holding back their cattle he asked what is the trouble with you they said we cannot water our flock till the shepherd have driven away theirs and our father is very old man
Al-Qasas,22,0.4404,0.0,0.879,0.121,so he watered their flock and moved into the shade and prayed my lord have need of whatever good you send me
Al-Qasas,49,-0.7906,0.158,0.791,0.05,then one of the maiden came to him walking bashfully and said my father invite you that he may repay you for having watered our flock so when moses came to him and told him his story he said have no fear you have escaped from the wicked people
Al-Qasas,21,0.9287,0.0,0.554,0.446,said one of the maiden father employ him surely the best man to employ is one who is strong and honest
Al-Qasas,57,0.7981,0.068,0.744,0.189,he said would like to marry one of these two daughter of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight year and if you stay on for ten it is up to you do not wish to impose any hardship on you god willing you will find me man of honour
Al-Qasas,25,0.128,0.177,0.601,0.222,moses said this is agreed between you and me whichever term fulfil no injustice will be done to me god is witness to our agreement
Al-Qasas,46,-0.0258,0.093,0.816,0.091,when moses had fulfilled the term and wa journeying with his family he noticed fire on the side of the mountain wait here he said to his family have seen fire may haply bring some news from there or an ember that you may warm yourselves
Al-Qasas,33,0.7184,0.0,0.838,0.162,when he drew near voice called out to him from the tree on the blessed spot on the right side of the valley moses am verily god the lord of all the world
Al-Qasas,31,-0.0,0.143,0.714,0.143,throw down your staff when he saw it wriggling like serpent he turned about and fled without turning moses approach said the voice and have no fear you will be safe
Al-Qasas,40,0.8581,0.045,0.696,0.259,put your hand inside your shirt it will come out white without tarnish of blame and do not be perturbed or afraid these are two proof from your lord for the pharaoh and his noble they are certainly rebellious people
Al-Qasas,14,-0.9246,0.53,0.47,0.0,he said lord have killed man of theirs and fear they would kill me
Al-Qasas,30,-0.6249,0.186,0.745,0.069,so send my brother aaron with me a helper for he is more fluent than with word that he should affirm me for fear that they would call me liar
Al-Qasas,41,0.0516,0.076,0.801,0.123,and god said we shall strengthen your arm with your brother and give you power with our sign and give you authority so that they will not be able to harm you both of you and your follower will be victorious
Al-Qasas,32,0.7579,0.0,0.822,0.178,but when moses came to them with our clear sign they said this is nothing but magic he ha contrived for we have not heard of this from our father of old
Al-Qasas,29,0.8957,0.105,0.545,0.35,but moses said my lord know well who ha come with guidance from him and for whom is the guerdon of paradise but surely the wicked will not prosper
Al-Qasas,41,-0.6505,0.161,0.746,0.094,the pharaoh said noble am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself so haman fire some clay brick to build tower for me that may mount up and see the god of moses for think he is liar
Al-Qasas,28,-0.6597,0.178,0.822,0.0,he and his soldier had become arrogant in the land for no reason and did not think that they have to come back to u in the end
Al-Qasas,22,-0.5267,0.139,0.861,0.0,so we seized him and his horde and threw them into the sea behold then how wa the end of the wicked
Al-Qasas,22,-0.6808,0.18,0.82,0.0,we made them the leader of those who call to hell and on the day of judgement they will not be helped
Al-Qasas,17,-0.7351,0.292,0.708,0.0,curse lie upon them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be despised
Al-Qasas,25,-0.1027,0.114,0.786,0.1,after we had destroyed the earlier generation we gave moses the book a evidence for mankind and guidance and grace so that they may remember
Al-Qasas,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you were not there on the western side of mount sinai when we gave the commandment to moses nor were you witness to the event
Al-Qasas,30,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we raised many more generation and prolonged their life you did not live with the people of midian nor recited to them our revelation but we kept on sending messenger
Al-Qasas,47,0.0516,0.071,0.873,0.056,you were not present on the side of mount sinai when we called and all this knowledge that you are given is by the grace of your lord so that you may warn people to whom no admonisher had come before you that they may take heed
Al-Qasas,40,-0.6249,0.097,0.903,0.0,and in case disaster come upon them for what they have done themselves they should say lord why did you not send an apostle to u that we should have followed your command and been with those who are believer
Al-Qasas,52,-0.0124,0.093,0.816,0.092,but when the truth came to them from u they said why is he not given the like of what wa given to moses did they not disbelieve before in what wa given to moses they said both are imposter one like the other and added we do not believe in either
Al-Qasas,22,0.743,0.0,0.722,0.278,say then bring book from god which give better guidance than these so that may follow it if you speak the truth
Al-Qasas,42,0.8075,0.0,0.803,0.197,then if they cannot give you an answer know that they are only following their lust and who can be farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from god and certainly god doe not guide an unjust people
Al-Qasas,12,-0.34,0.179,0.821,0.0,we have been sending word to them that they may take warning
Al-Qasas,13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,those to whom we gave the book before this do believe in it
Al-Qasas,26,0.5267,0.0,0.845,0.155,and when it is read out to them say we believe in it it the truth from our lord we had committed ourselves before it came
Al-Qasas,23,-0.3612,0.155,0.742,0.102,these will be given their recompense twice for they persevered and repelled evil with good and spent of what we had given them
Al-Qasas,27,0.34,0.071,0.811,0.118,when they hear idle talk they turn aside and say to u our action to you yours peace on you we do not look for the ignorant
Al-Qasas,20,0.8779,0.0,0.59,0.41,you cannot guide any one you like god guide whosoever he please he know best who will come to guidance
Al-Qasas,42,0.2732,0.0,0.949,0.051,they say if we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force have we not set up sanctuary for them to which is brought wealth of everything a provision from u but most of them do not understand
Al-Qasas,30,-0.4767,0.102,0.863,0.035,how many habitation that had come to boast of their resource have we destroyed these their dwelling were never inhabited except rarely after them and they came back to u
Al-Qasas,36,0.8897,0.0,0.758,0.242,but your lord doe not destroy habitation without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out our commandment to them we would never have destroyed city if their inhabitant were not given to wickedness
Al-Qasas,30,0.6486,0.0,0.841,0.159,whatsoever ha been given you is the stuff this life is made of and only it embellishment what is with your lord is better and abiding will you not understand
Al-Qasas,37,0.7509,0.0,0.773,0.227,can one who wa given better promise which he will find come true be like him who wa given little enjoyment of this life but who will afterwards be brought to judgement on the day of resurrection
Al-Qasas,16,0.2732,0.0,0.877,0.123,that day god will call them and ask where are they you imagined were my compeer
Al-Qasas,32,0.3822,0.084,0.73,0.185,those against whom the sentence is justified will say lord these are those we had led astray a we had ourselves gone astray we clear ourselves before you they never worshipped u
Al-Qasas,33,0.5499,0.0,0.9,0.1,the sinner will be told invoke your partner they will call on them but they will not answer and they will see the torment and wish if only they had come to guidance
Al-Qasas,14,0.2732,0.0,0.861,0.139,god will ask them on that day what answer did you give the apostle
Al-Qasas,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then all news will be blacked out for them and they will not even ask one another
Al-Qasas,16,0.9136,0.0,0.526,0.474,but he who repents and belief and doe good thing may well be among the successful
Al-Qasas,28,0.7269,0.0,0.779,0.221,your lord creates what he will and chooses the good is not for them to choose too holy and high is god for what they associate with him
Al-Qasas,14,0.1027,0.108,0.759,0.133,your lord well know what they hide in their breast and what they disclose
Al-Qasas,31,0.5994,0.108,0.682,0.21,he is god there is no god but he his alone is praise first and last and his the judgement and to him will you be brought back in the end
Al-Qasas,35,0.4397,0.067,0.744,0.189,say just think if god were to cover you up with night for ever until the day of doom what other god apart from god will give you light why do you not pay heed
Al-Qasas,32,0.5789,0.0,0.835,0.165,say just think if god were to make the day perpetual till the day of resurrection what other god but god would bring you night for rest why do you not reflect
Al-Qasas,24,0.6908,0.0,0.794,0.206,yet in his benevolence he made you night and day that you may rest and seek his bounty during them and haply maybe grateful
Al-Qasas,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,upon day he will call them and ask where are they you imagined were my compeer
Al-Qasas,35,0.2732,0.0,0.942,0.058,and we shall single out one witness from each community and say bring your proof then will they know that god is the judgement and what they contrived will avail them not in the least
Al-Qasas,44,-0.7518,0.177,0.769,0.054,verily qarun wa of moses people but he began to oppress them we had given him treasure so many that team of wrestler could hardly lift their key his people said to him do not be exultant god doe not like those who exult
Al-Qasas,49,0.9465,0.034,0.617,0.349,so seek the abode of the hereafter through what god ha given you and do not forget your part in this world do good to others a god ha done good to you and do not try to spread corruption in the land surely god doe not like corrupters
Al-Qasas,42,-0.3337,0.166,0.714,0.12,he said this ha come to me through my own acumen did he not know that god had destroyed many generation before him who possessed far more acumen than he and more wealth the sinner will not be asked about their sin
Al-Qasas,32,0.8555,0.0,0.755,0.245,then he came before his people in all pomp and those enamoured of this world said ah would that we had what qarun ha been given he indeed posse great good fortune
Al-Qasas,27,0.8847,0.0,0.699,0.301,but those who knew better said alack day god guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right only those who persevere will receive it
Al-Qasas,32,0.7906,0.0,0.784,0.216,so we opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion there wa not body that could help him against the will of god nor wa he able to save himself
Al-Qasas,53,0.1896,0.127,0.716,0.157,those who were envious of his position only yesterday said on the morrow indeed god increase the fortune of those of his creature a he will and decrease had god not been gracious to u he could have opened up the earth and made it swallow u surely the infidel will not succeed
Al-Qasas,38,0.1724,0.031,0.92,0.049,we shall give the mansion of the hereafter to those who do not want to be haughty in the land and spread corruption the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
Al-Qasas,26,0.4019,0.064,0.746,0.19,whoever doe good will receive better than what he ha done and whoever doe ill shall be requited but to the extent of what he doe
Al-Qasas,34,0.5859,0.067,0.746,0.187,he who ha assigned the propagation of the qur an to you will bring you back to the destination say my lord know who ha come to guidance and who is clearly in error
Al-Qasas,27,0.2177,0.068,0.835,0.097,you did not expect that the book would be given to you except by the favour of your lord so do not be the helper of unbeliever
Al-Qasas,32,0.2732,0.0,0.937,0.063,nor should you let them turn you away from the commandment of god once they have been delivered to you and call them to your lord and do not be an idolater
Al-Qasas,39,0.899,0.033,0.685,0.281,and do not call on any other god apart from god there is no god but he all thing will perish save his magnificence his is the judgement and to him will you be brought back in the end

As-Saaffaat,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and abraham indeed wa of his inducement
As-Saaffaat,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when he came to his lord with heart compliant
As-Saaffaat,14,0.296,0.0,0.855,0.145,when he said to his father and his people what is this you worship

As-Saaffaat,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but they turned their back on him and went away
As-Saaffaat,16,0.2732,0.0,0.877,0.123,then he turned towards their god and said why do you not eat of these offering
As-Saaffaat,10,-0.4767,0.256,0.744,0.0,what is wrong with you that you do not speak
As-Saaffaat,10,0.4939,0.0,0.738,0.262,then he started striking them down with his right hand
As-Saaffaat,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so the people descended upon him
As-Saaffaat,10,0.296,0.0,0.804,0.196,why do you worship these you carve yourselves he asked
As-Saaffaat,9,0.6705,0.0,0.48,0.52,when god ha created you and what you make

Muhammad,34,0.7684,0.081,0.686,0.233,but those who believe and do the right and believe what ha been revealed to muhammad which is the truth from their lord will have their fault condoned by him and their state improved
Muhammad,32,0.8625,0.04,0.704,0.256,that is because those who refuse to believe only follow what is false but those who believe follow the truth from their lord that is how god give men precept of wisdom
Muhammad,75,-0.838,0.179,0.708,0.114,so when you clash with the unbeliever smite their neck until you overpower them then hold them in bondage then either free them graciously or after taking ransom until war shall have come to end if god had pleased he could have punished them himself but he will to test some of you through some others he will not allow the deed of those who are killed in the cause of god to go waste

Muhammad,27,-0.1335,0.104,0.777,0.119,have they not journeyed in the land and seen the fate of those before them destroyed they were utterly by god and similar fate awaits the unbeliever
Muhammad,18,0.7635,0.088,0.56,0.351,this is so for god is the friend of those who believe while the unbeliever have no friend
Muhammad,35,-0.4939,0.147,0.711,0.142,verily god will admit those who believe and do the right into garden with stream of water running by but the unbeliever revel and carouse and subsist like beast and hell will be their residence

Muhammad,82,0.9337,0.046,0.762,0.192,the semblance of paradise promised the pious and devout is that of garden with stream of water that will not go rank and river of milk whose taste will not undergo change and river of wine delectable to drinker and stream of purified honey and fruit of every kind in them and forgiveness of their lord are these like those who will live for ever in the fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestine to shred
Muhammad,46,0.3919,0.0,0.942,0.058,there are some who listen to you but a soon a they go from you they say to those who were given knowledge what is this he is saying now they are those whose heart have been sealed by god and they follow their own lust
Muhammad,20,0.5023,0.0,0.854,0.146,but those who are rightly guided will be given greater guidance by him and they will have their intrinsic piety
Muhammad,35,0.1154,0.068,0.852,0.08,do they wait for any thing but the hour of change that it may come upon them suddenly it sign have already appeared how then will they be warned when it ha come upon them
Muhammad,29,-0.1655,0.174,0.643,0.183,know then therefore there is no god but he and ask forgiveness for your sin and those of believing men and woman god know your wandering and your destination
Muhammad,42,-0.9481,0.324,0.62,0.056,those who believe say how is it no surah wa revealed but when categorical surah is revealed that mention war you should see those who are sceptical staring at you like man in the swoon of death ala the woe for them
Muhammad,26,0.9186,0.0,0.571,0.429,obedience and modest speech would have been more becoming and when the matter ha been determined it is best for them to be true to god
Muhammad,21,-0.0772,0.112,0.747,0.141,is it possible that if placed in authority you will create disorder in the land and sever your bond of relationship

Muhammad,18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do they not ponder on what the qur an say or have their heart been sealed with lock
Muhammad,26,0.802,0.0,0.737,0.263,those who turn their back after the way of guidance ha been opened to them have been surely tempted by satan and beguiled by illusory hope
Muhammad,28,0.6705,0.061,0.685,0.254,this wa so because they said to those who disdain what god ha revealed we shall obey you in some thing but god know their secret intention well
Muhammad,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,how will it be when the angel draw out their soul striking their face and their back

Al-Hadeed,33,0.4563,0.05,0.819,0.131,what ha come upon you that you believe not in god though the prophet is calling you to believe in your lord and he ha already taken your pledge if you are believer
Al-Hadeed,30,0.9287,0.048,0.576,0.376,it is he who sends down splendent revelation to his votary that he may take you out of darkness into light for surely god is gracious and kind to you
Al-Hadeed,77,0.946,0.049,0.706,0.245,what ha come upon you that you do not spend in the way of god when the heritage of the heaven and the earth belongs to god those of you who spent before the victory and fought are not equal to those who did not they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought to each one god ha made the promise of excellence for god is aware of all you do
Al-Hadeed,19,0.8625,0.0,0.625,0.375,who will give goodly loan to god which he will double for him and be for him splendid reward
Al-Hadeed,50,0.7906,0.0,0.873,0.127,the day you see the believer men and woman with their light advancing ahead and to the right of them they will be told there is good news for you this day of garden with river flowing by where you will live for ever this will be the great attainment
Al-Hadeed,55,0.4019,0.0,0.952,0.048,the day the hypocrite men and woman will say to the believer wait for u that we may borrow little light from your light they will be told go back and look for your light wall shall be raised between them in which there will be door within it will be benevolence and retribution without
Al-Hadeed,51,-0.2023,0.204,0.59,0.206,they will call to them were we not with you they will answer certainly but then you let yourselves be tempted and waited in expectation but were suspicious and were deceived by vain desire till the decree of god came to pas and the deceiver duped you in respect of god
Al-Hadeed,31,-0.8553,0.311,0.568,0.12,so no ransom will be accepted of you on this day or of those who refused to believe hell will be your refuge and the only friend and how evil destination
Al-Hadeed,56,0.4669,0.026,0.862,0.112,ha the moment not yet come when the heart of believer should be moved by the thought of god and the truth that ha been sent down so that they should not be like those who received the book before them but whose heart were hardened after lapse of time and many of them turned disobedient
Al-Hadeed,23,0.3818,0.121,0.638,0.242,know that god enlivens the earth even after it ha died we have explained to you clearly our sign that you may understand
Al-Hadeed,26,0.93,0.0,0.587,0.413,surely the men and woman who spend in charity and give goodly loan to god will have it doubled for them and will receive generous reward
Al-Hadeed,47,0.4325,0.084,0.745,0.172,those who believe in god and his apostle are true of word and deed and by their lord are considered testifier of the truth they have their guerdon and their light a for those who do not believe and reject our revelation are the people of hell
Al-Hadeed,87,0.7541,0.09,0.756,0.154,know that the life of this world is only frolic and mummery an ornamentation boasting and bragging among yourselves and lust for multiplying wealth and child it is like rain so pleasing to the cultivator for his vegetation which sprout and swell and then begin to wither and you see it turn to yellow and reduced to chaff there is severe punishment in the hereafter but also forgiveness from god and acceptance a for the life of this world it is no more than merchandise of vanity
Al-Hadeed,55,0.9612,0.0,0.662,0.338,hasten for the forgiveness of your lord and paradise whose expanse is a wide a that of the heaven and the earth which ha been prepared for those who believe in god and his apostle this is the bounty of god which he bestows on whosoever he please and the bounty of god is infinite
Al-Hadeed,35,0.2617,0.043,0.886,0.071,there is no calamity that befalls the earth or your own self but in accordance with the law of causation before we make it evident this is indeed how the law of god work inevitably
Al-Hadeed,22,-0.4885,0.271,0.564,0.166,lest you grieve for what you missed or rejoice at what you received god doe not love the egoist and the braggart
Al-Hadeed,26,0.8658,0.0,0.673,0.327,who hold back what they posse and enjoin stinginess on others whoever turn away from god should remember that god is self sufficient worthy of praise
Al-Hadeed,60,0.9671,0.029,0.648,0.323,we have surely sent apostle with clear sign and sent with them the book and the balance so that men may stand by justice and we sent down iron which cause much distress but also ha advantage for men so that god may know who help him and his apostle in secret verily god is all powerful and all mighty
Al-Hadeed,27,0.1406,0.0,0.944,0.056,we sent noah and abraham and gave prophethood to their progeny and the book and some of them are well directed but many of them are disobedient
Al-Hadeed,81,0.9655,0.0,0.771,0.229,then in their train we sent our apostle and succeeding them jesus son of mary and gave him the gospel and put into the heart of his follower compassion and kindness but they created monasticism which had not been prescribed for them by u except for seeking the pleasure of god yet they did not observe it a it should have been rightly observed so we gave those among them who were believer their reward but most of them are disobedient
Al-Hadeed,40,0.8126,0.066,0.676,0.258,you who believe have fear of displeasing god and believe in his prophet he will give you twice a much of his bounty and place light for you to walk in and forgive you for god is forgiving and kind
Al-Hadeed,45,0.8689,0.0,0.772,0.228,so that the people of the book may know that they have not the least power over the bounty of god and that the bounty is wholly in the hand of god to give whosoever he please for god is the master of infinite bounty
Al-Mujadila,30,0.5574,0.133,0.59,0.277,god certainly heard what the woman who argued with you about her husband said and complained to god and god heard your interrogation verily god hears all and see everything
Al-Mujadila,40,0.8151,0.0,0.814,0.186,those of you who divorce your wife by calling them mother cannot make them their mother their mother are only those who gave birth to them they surely utter what is unseemly and lie but god is forbearing and forgiving
Al-Mujadila,35,0.6124,0.037,0.82,0.143,those who call their wife their mother then revoke what they had said should free slave before having physical contact with them this is to warn you a god is aware of what you do
Al-Mujadila,68,-0.34,0.137,0.731,0.132,if one doe not have the mean of doing so then he should fast for two month continuously before he ha physical contact but any one who is unable to do so should feed sixty needy person this is enjoined so that you may be faithful to god and his apostle these are the limit set by god a for the unbeliever there is painful punishment for them
Al-Mujadila,25,-0.6605,0.281,0.569,0.15,those who oppose god will be disgraced a those before them were we have sent down very clear sign for unbeliever there is shameful punishment
Al-Mujadila,32,0.5267,0.052,0.773,0.174,on the day when god will raise them up together he will tell them what they did god take account of it although they forget for all thing are evident to god
Al-Mujadila,67,-0.1969,0.108,0.821,0.071,have you not considered that god know whatever is in the heaven and the earth no three person confer secretly but he is the fourth among them and no five but he is the sixth and neither fewer nor more but he is with them wheresoever they be and on the day of judgement he will announce their deed to them verily god ha knowledge of everything
Al-Mujadila,75,-0.9636,0.285,0.579,0.136,have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire but reverted after time to what wa forbidden them and conspired evil rebellion and disobedience to the prophet yet when they come to you they greet you with greeting even god doe not greet you with and say to themselves why doesn god punish u for what we say hell is sufficient for them in which they will be burnt and what an evil consequence
Al-Mujadila,33,0.2732,0.135,0.704,0.161,you who believe when you converse privately do not talk of iniquity rebellion and disobedience to the prophet but talk of goodness and piety and fear god before whom you will be gathered
Al-Mujadila,31,0.9363,0.048,0.551,0.4,surely scheming is the work of satan that he may cause the faithful grief but he cannot harm them unless god dispense so in god should the believer place their trust
Al-Mujadila,54,0.6486,0.0,0.89,0.11,you who believe when you are told to make room in the assembly then make room god will give you more room to spread when you are told to rise then rise god will raise those of you who believe and those who have knowledge in position god is aware of what you do
Al-Mujadila,44,0.936,0.0,0.7,0.3,you who believe if you confer with the prophet in private give alms in the name of god before you go to confer this is better for you and becoming if you do not have the mean then surely god is forgiving and kind
Al-Mujadila,50,0.9393,0.023,0.668,0.309,are you afraid of giving alms before confering then if you cannot do this and god forgives you be constant in your devotional obligation and pay the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others and obey god and his prophet god is aware of all you do
Al-Mujadila,32,0.6249,0.035,0.812,0.154,have you not seen those who have taken people who have roused the wrath of god a friend they are neither of you nor of them and swear to lie and knowingly
Al-Mujadila,14,-0.7717,0.43,0.38,0.19,god ha reserved severe punishment for them evil indeed are the thing they do
Al-Mujadila,20,-0.6486,0.251,0.667,0.082,they have made their oath shield and obstruct people from the way of god there is shameful punishment for them
Al-Mujadila,22,-0.7293,0.255,0.671,0.074,neither their wealth nor child will avail them against god they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
Al-Mujadila,34,-0.3818,0.155,0.788,0.057,on the day that god will raise them together they will swear before him a they swear before you and imagine they are on the right path is it not they who are liar
Al-Mujadila,25,0.6705,0.063,0.693,0.244,satan ha got the better of them and made them forget to remember god indeed they belong to satan faction will not satan faction perish
Al-Mujadila,13,0.6124,0.0,0.688,0.312,surely those who oppose god and his prophet will be among the vilest
Al-Mujadila,15,0.8126,0.0,0.539,0.461,god ha decreed will prevail and my apostle verily god is powerful and all mighty
Al-Mujadila,91,0.9861,0.0,0.667,0.333,you will not find those who believe in god and the day of resurrection loving those who oppose god and his prophet even though they be their father son or brother or their kin god ha inscribed on their heart belief and ha succoured them with his own grace and will admit them to garden with river flowing by where they will abide for ever god accepting them and they happy in the pleasure of god they are verily the army of god will not the army of god be victorious
Al-Hashr,20,0.9022,0.0,0.569,0.431,whatever is in the heaven and the earth sings the praise of god he is all mighty and all wise
Al-Hashr,84,-0.3202,0.161,0.681,0.158,it is he who drove those among the people of the book who refused to believe from their home for the first confrontation you did not think that they would go away and they imagined that their fort would protect them against god but god came upon them from where they did not suspect and filled their heart with terror so that they destroyed their home with their own hand or were destroyed by the hand of believer so take heed men of sight
Al-Hashr,28,-0.8658,0.293,0.65,0.057,had god not decreed the expulsion for them he would have punished them in this world and in the next the punishment of hell would have been theirs
Al-Hashr,18,0.4019,0.114,0.611,0.275,for they had opposed god and his apostle and whosoever opposes god then god is severe in retribution
Al-Hashr,22,-0.34,0.195,0.662,0.143,the palm tree that you cut down or left standing intact wa by god dispensation so that he might disgrace the transgressor
Al-Hashr,35,0.8519,0.0,0.702,0.298,you did not charge with horse or camel for whatever spoil god gave his apostle from them in any case god give authority to his apostle over whomsoever he please god ha power over everything
Al-Hashr,70,0.8481,0.118,0.65,0.232,whatever booty god give to his apostle from the people of the city is for god and his apostle the near relation the orphan the needy and wayfarer so that it doe not concentrate in the hand of those who are rich among you accept what the apostle give you and refrain from what he forbids and take heed for yourself and fear god surely god is severe of retribution
